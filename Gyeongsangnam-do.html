Unlike other mountains where the purpose lies in trekking and climbing to the mountain summit, the most fruitful experience one can get from exploring Yeonhwasan Mountain is a visit to Okcheonsa Temple. From the summit of the mountain, visitors will be able to see Okcheonsa Temple nestled in the mountain and the deep blue sea along Danghangpo Resort to the mountains south.","regDate":"2022-12-27","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Provincial Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-27-1672115914882/1611191_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-27-1672115914882","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-27-1672115914882"},{"id":"2022-12-27-1672112155057","title":"Yeongchuksan Mountain (영축산)","description":"Located in Gajisan Provincial Park, Yeongchuksan Mountain has an elevation of 1,059 meters.

The reason why this was regarded as a pagoda is that there are similarly shaped stone pagodas in the Andong and Uiseong regions. The basis for it being called Wangreung, or royal tomb, is that there is a record in Dongguk Yeoji Seongram (an ancient history book published during the rule of King Seongjong in the Joseon dynasty) and in Saneum-hyeon Sancheonjo (a record of events in the region) of it being a tomb. The notes state that there is a structure with steps on the four faces, in the form of nine dragons piled up of stones at a distance of about 16 km (40 ri\u0026nbsp;in traditional Korean scale) from the village, so people believe it must be a royal tomb.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e The record describing the name of the king buried in this tomb can be extracted from a record of travels called Wangsan Shimreunggi written by Hong Ui Young, a Joseon dynasty scholar.

The top of the tomb is  oval in shape. At the center, there is a stone tablet with the words Royal Tomb of King Yang of the Garak Nation.
