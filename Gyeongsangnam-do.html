The valley derives its name “Baenaegol,” meaning “the valley of pears,” from the wild pear trees that grow in large numbers along the valley.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe valley covers nearly 8 kilometers of land between the range connecting Sinbulsan Mountain and Yeongchuksan Mountain and the western range connecting Cheonhwangsan Mountain and Jaeyaksan Mountain in Miryang. It is a popular vacation destination in the summer. Also, many tourists come to drink the water containing acer mono sap, which is known to be produced in this region during the springtime.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBaenaegol Valley is just a short distance away from downtown Yangsan. The valley provides an opportunity to enjoy nature away from the hustle and bustle of the city center. The long valley is wedged between highlands, which results in at least two hours less of sunshine than other regions, so it feels cooler in the summer months. Strawberries are also widely grown in the area.","regDate":"2022-07-30","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Valleys"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228175_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-07-30-1659163505785","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-07-30-1659163505785"},{"id":"2022-07-30-1659159589087","title":"Baegundonggyegok Valley, Sancheong (백운동계곡(산청))","description":"If you go 5 km up along the valley at Baegam-ri, under the thick woods, you will find a 180 square meter long stone named ‘Jeomjeong Rock’ and a small waterfall. This valley is Baegundonggyegok Valley.  For almost 6 km, the water of the valley flows over only rocks, with over twenty large and small falls and lakes.  Large stones in the valley are gorgeous because the stones are washed with sunbeams and the strong current of water.  The most famous falls are Baeunpokpo Waterfall and Odampokpo Waterfall.  Strong current of water flows in Deungcheondae, where the letters ‘Yeongnamjeilcheonsok’ are carved.  Baegundonggyegok Valley is a clean area due to maintenance of the clean natural environment.

After her death, she becomes a ghost and appears to every district magistrate (highest-ranking officer in a region) to appeal for the investigation of her unfair death, but each district magistrate dies of a heart attack. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen, a new district magistrate by the name Lee is dispatched to the area. Unlike his predecessors, Lee listens to the story of the ghost and finds the low-ranked officer who had killed her and punishes him. He found Arang’s body and holded a religious ceremony on her behalf. Aranggak was also built in her memory. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery year, an event called Arangje is held on April 16 by the lunar calendar in Aranggak Pavilion. Young maidens dressed in white hanbok perform a religious ceremony to soothe the sorrow of Arang. There is also a saying that the spirit of Arang will preserve the love of those couples who visit the pavilion together.","regDate":"2022-07-30","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-30-1659154895976/574085_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-07-30-1659154895976","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-07-30-1659154895976"},{"id":"2022-07-30-1659149972284","title":"Anmingogae Hill (안민고개)","description":"Anmingogae Hill is a 9-kilometer-long hill that stretches from Taebaek-dong in Jinhae to Anmin-dong in Changwon.
