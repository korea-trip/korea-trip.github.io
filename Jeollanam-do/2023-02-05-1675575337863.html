It was renamed Jeongsusa Temple during the latter part of the Joseon dynasty (1392-1905).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe temple was reportedly established by the state monk Doseon-guksa in the first year of the reign of Silla Kingdom’s King Aejang (800).

Daeungjeon, the main hall, has three rooms in the front and two on the sides with a gambrel roof.
