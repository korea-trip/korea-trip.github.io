Unfortunately, most of the temple buildings have been destroyed and only the main hall, Daeungjeon Hall, and a few smaller structures such as the living quarters remain on site today. The temple was originally called Ssanggyesa Temple because the waters of two valleys meet in front of this temple. It was renamed Jeongsusa Temple during the latter part of the Joseon dynasty (1392-1905).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe temple was reportedly established by the state monk Doseon-guksa in the first year of the reign of Silla Kingdom’s King Aejang (800). However, the temple’s founding year preceded the monk’s year of birth so there seems to have been a mistake in the year of foundation. Daeungjeon, the main hall, has three rooms in the front and two on the sides with a gambrel roof. Designated as Jeollanam-do Tangible Cultural Property, the structure features a modest and simple architecture that is estimated to date back to the latter half of the Joseon dynasty.","regDate":"2023-02-04","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollanam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Jeollanam-do/2023-02-04-1675506964115"},{"id":"2023-02-04-1675499868944","title":"Jasan Park (자산공원)","description":"The city of Yeosu is nestled on the Yeosu Peninsula and the areas of Yeosu-si, Yeoncheon-si and Yeocheon-gun, which all have the same first character ‘려(麗) (ryeo)’ were combined as one into Yeosu-si as of April, 1998.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLocated at the entrance of the breakwater of Odongdo Island, Jasan Park embraces the South Sea.\u003cbr\u003eThousands of evergreen trees and flowering plants spread out over the wide flats when approaching the peak by the steep staircase.
