Gatbawi is named after its shape, which is said to look like two men wearing traditional Korean hats called “gat” (“bawi” meaning “rock”). The rock is actually made of two individual formations  one measuring 8 meters tall and one 6 meters tall. Valued not only for its aesthetics, Gatbawi Rock is of high geological value as a “natural sculpture” that was formed as a result of years of weathering. The rock formation was officially recognized as Natural Monument No. 500 on April 27, 2009.","regDate":"2023-02-05","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollanam-do","Nature","Natural Resources","Rocks"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-05-1675586212073/1609494_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollanam-do/2023-02-05-1675586212073"},{"id":"2023-02-05-1675582517908","title":"Modo Island (모도)","description":"In 1929, Modo Island was spotted by Kim Hae-gim on his way to Jeju Island. He called the island Ttiseom because of the multitude of ttipul grass, a grass native to Korea, on the island. There were also many houses with thatched roofs made with dried ttipul on the island. The name Modo Island comes from the Hanja characters for Ttiseom.","regDate":"2023-02-05","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollanam-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Jeollanam-do/2023-02-05-1675582517908"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/[...pid]","query":{"pid":["Jeollanam-do","2023-02-04-1675481763666"]},"buildId":"WNKxrP-3QySrQR_ysnuGE","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
