A swimming pool has been installed over an area of 8,910 square meters, for swimming even during low tide. Also, various facilities have been installed for the visitors convenience. A long, wooden bridge was installed for the viewing of the mud flats and sea creatures during low tide. On the mud flats there is a flurry of sea life, and the look-out sheds near the beach sell fresh summer fruits.","regDate":"2023-01-17","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollanam-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-17-1673951831613/1809835_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollanam-do/2023-01-17-1673951831613"},{"id":"2023-01-17-1673948196869","title":"Dogapsa Temple (도갑사)","description":"Dogapsa Temple, built during the late Silla period, has a long history and various national treasures.

Most dinosaur tracks found in Korea are located in coastal areas in cities like Haenam and Boseong, so the discovery in the inner region of Jeollanam-do was a first. Most prints here come from carnivorous dinaosaurs of the Cretaceous period. The site is famous for there being tracks from no fewer than five different dinosaurs, as well as for being one of the longest trails and most direct examples of the exact movements of the dinosaurs. The tracks of one dinosaur are the longest in the world, stretching for 40 meters. Based on the foot size of 20-22 centimeters with a stride of approximately 90 centimeters, it is estimated that the prints were formed by a 4-5 meter tall Koolasuchus. In addition to the canivorous dinosaurs, tracks were found of 12 herbivorous dinosaurs, as well as fossilized plants. These plants offer much assistance in the research of herbivorous dinosaur diets.","regDate":"2023-01-17","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollanam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Eco-Tourism Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-17-1673944760289/1608223_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollanam-do/2023-01-17-1673944760289"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/[...pid]","query":{"pid":["Jeollanam-do","2023-01-15-1673775389118"]},"buildId":"IukKedAnsRm8YJt199BLV","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
