Due to Wangin’s importance and contributions to Korean history, this historical attraction is preserved and maintained in honor of his memory and achievements.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeonggidong is the official birthplace of Dr. Wangin (marked by the Yuheobi memorial monument) and is also home to Seongcheon; the well Wangin is believed to have drunk from.  Halfway up Wolchulsan Mountain are Chaekgul, Munsanjae and Yangsajae where Wangin is said to have studied as well as nurtured local pupils. To commemorate the significance of these areas, a memorial is held every March at Munsanjae and Yansanjae.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e      In front of Chaekgul is a statue of Dr. Wangin which is said to symbolize his benevolent character. Just west of Seonggidong is Doljeonggogae, a hill from which it is believed Dr. Wangin made a sorrowful look back at his countrymen before leaving for Japan. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWangin departed for Japan from Sangdaepo, which at the time was an international trading port. The renowned Baekje scholar was beginning his journey at the request of Japanese Emperor Eungshin. He took with him ten books on the Analects of Confucius and a book of Cheonjamun, a text of one thousand Chinese characters. Over time, he earned the trust of the emperor and became instructor to the crown prince. Wangin is well-known for his part in the development of Japanese culture and his name appears often in Japanese history. Wangin educated beyond textbooks and made great contributions to the development of arts, crafts and music and is revered as the originator of Japan’s Asuka culture.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis historic site was originally reconstructed from 1985 to 1987 and is continually receiving improvements to improve accessibility for visitors.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330\u003cbr\u003e (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) \u003cbr\u003e •For more info: +82-61-470-6643|\n|parking:|Available (150 parking spaces)|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Parking Fees:|Large vehicles 2,500 won / Mid-sized vehicles (more than 9 passengers) 2,000 won / Small vehicles 1,500 won|\n|Admission Fees:|Adults (ages 19-64): 1,000 won / Group: 700 won\u003cbr\u003eTeenagers (ages 13-18): 800 won / Group: 500  won\u003cbr\u003eChildren (ages 7-12): 500 won / Group: 300 won\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* Group: 30 or more people\u003cbr\u003e* Free admission: Preschoolers (ages 6 or younger) \u0026 Senior citizens (ages 65 \u0026 older)|\n|Available Facilities:|* Yeongwolgwan – Information on Dr. Waningin’s achievements and contributions to the Baekje dynasty on display.

It is made up of 250 smaller islands, and it is famous for a strip of dry road that appears from the middle of the sea, near the end of February and mid June of the lunar calendar.  As it resembles a passage in the Old Testament in the Book of Exodus, the event is called “The Miracle of Moses.”  When the water recedes, a road about 30-40 meter wide and 2.8-kilometer long appears and stays for about an hour before being submerged again. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJindo Island has some legends which are still popular today, especially that of “Old Woman Bbyong of Hoedongri.” A long time ago, there were many tigers on Jindo Island. When tigers began appearing frequently in the village, the people fled to Modo Island. In the process, only the old woman Bbyong ended up remaining on the island, so the lady prayed everyday to Yongwang, the god of the ocean, to let her see her family again. Around February, Yongwang appeared to her in her dream and said, “I will send a rainbow to the sea tomorrow; ride it and cross the ocean”. The next day old woman Bbyong went out to the sea and prayed again, and the seawater parted as the rainbow road appeared.  Through this road, her family and the other villagers came back to the island. Therefore when the sea parts, the people celebrate this phenomenon by holding the Yeongdeung Festival to remember the Old Woman Bbyong. During the Festival, original folk plays of Jindo Island are performed and draws many tourists into Jindo Island.","regDate":"2023-01-24","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollanam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Eco-Tourism Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-24-1674535168286/1993038_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollanam-do/2023-01-24-1674535168286"},{"id":"2023-01-24-1674531363287","title":"Jindo Island (진도)","description":"Jindo Island is the principal island among the cluster of 230 islets in the southwestern part of the Korean peninsula.
