Due to Wangin’s importance and contributions to Korean history, this historical attraction is preserved and maintained in honor of his memory and achievements.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeonggidong is the official birthplace of Dr. Wangin (marked by the Yuheobi memorial monument) and is also home to Seongcheon; the well Wangin is believed to have drunk from.  Halfway up Wolchulsan Mountain are Chaekgul, Munsanjae and Yangsajae where Wangin is said to have studied as well as nurtured local pupils. To commemorate the significance of these areas, a memorial is held every March at Munsanjae and Yansanjae.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e      In front of Chaekgul is a statue of Dr. Wangin which is said to symbolize his benevolent character. Just west of Seonggidong is Doljeonggogae, a hill from which it is believed Dr. Wangin made a sorrowful look back at his countrymen before leaving for Japan. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWangin departed for Japan from Sangdaepo, which at the time was an international trading port. The renowned Baekje scholar was beginning his journey at the request of Japanese Emperor Eungshin. He took with him ten books on the Analects of Confucius and a book of Cheonjamun, a text of one thousand Chinese characters. Over time, he earned the trust of the emperor and became instructor to the crown prince. Wangin is well-known for his part in the development of Japanese culture and his name appears often in Japanese history. Wangin educated beyond textbooks and made great contributions to the development of arts, crafts and music and is revered as the originator of Japan’s Asuka culture.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis historic site was originally reconstructed from 1985 to 1987 and is continually receiving improvements to improve accessibility for visitors.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330\u003cbr\u003e (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) \u003cbr\u003e •For more info: +82-61-470-6643|\n|parking:|Available (150 parking spaces)|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Parking Fees:|Large vehicles 2,500 won / Mid-sized vehicles (more than 9 passengers) 2,000 won / Small vehicles 1,500 won|\n|Admission Fees:|Adults (ages 19-64): 1,000 won / Group: 700 won\u003cbr\u003eTeenagers (ages 13-18): 800 won / Group: 500  won\u003cbr\u003eChildren (ages 7-12): 500 won / Group: 300 won\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* Group: 30 or more people\u003cbr\u003e* Free admission: Preschoolers (ages 6 or younger) \u0026 Senior citizens (ages 65 \u0026 older)|\n|Available Facilities:|* Yeongwolgwan – Information on Dr. Waningin’s achievements and contributions to the Baekje dynasty on display.
