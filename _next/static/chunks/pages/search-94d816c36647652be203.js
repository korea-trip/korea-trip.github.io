The peak with the circumference of 4 km forms a great panoramic view along with Daecheongbong Peak and Outer Seorak. Ulsan Peak presents an imposing scene, and it was visited by many famous poets and calligraphers including Choe Yeon and Heo Jeok during the Joseon period who left behind their records. In addition, several legends are associated with Ulsan Peak. One day, a heavenly god commanded peaks of all mountains to assemble at Geumgangsan Mountain to create the greatest scenery. However, the Ulsan Peak was too heavy, so it was late for the meeting. Feeling ashamed, it didn\u2019t go back home (Ulsan) directly, and took a rest at Seoraksan Mountain, but stayed there forever. Also, there is a saying that the peak was named after the shape of the rock, which resembles a fence (ul+tari) or a crying (ul) mountain (san). Visitors can get to the Ulsan Peak by starting from the small park and passing through Sinheungsa Temple and Heundeul Rock. At the beginning of the path, it starts with a gentle slope, but after the Heundeul Rock, there are a steep rocky hill and the iron stairs. It requires about 4 hr for getting to and from the peak. It is hard for the elderly or children to climb because of high level of difficulty."},{"id":"2022-10-16-1665917282385","title":"Villa of Lee Ki-poong (\uc774\uae30\ubd95\ubcc4\uc7a5)","imgUrl":"/2022-10-16-1665917282385/1906632_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-16-1665917282385","description":"The villa of Lee Ki-poong is located between the villas of Rhee Syngman and Kim Ilsung on the shores of Hwajinpo Lake.

King Jeongjo was the second son of King Jangjo and Queen Heongyeong, but in 1759, when he was 8 years old, he was designated as the heir to the throne. During his 24 year-reign, King Jeongjo influenced state affairs by implementing the \u201cTangpyeongchaek (a policy to balance the power of political factions),\u201d and he also had great accomplishments in the area of academic research by creating the \u201cGyujanggak (a national royal library).\u201d <br><br> Queen Hyoui was a daughter of Kim Si Muk and was installed as a partner of the heir to the throne at the age of 10. In 1776, when King Jeongjo ascended the throne, she also became Queen. She is known to have led a frugal life. In 1821, she died without an heir at the age of 69 in Jagyeongjeon, Changgyeonggung Palace. <br><br> Geolleung looks very similar to Yungneung, but unlike Yungneung, it does not have a \u201cByeongpungseok,\u201d which is a wide and rectangular stone that surrounds the mound and protects it. Instead, it is surrounded by \u201cNanganseok,\u201d stone handrails. On every handrail, lotus flowers are engraved. King Jeongjo\u2019s tomb is simpler and less decorated than his father\u2019s, which reflects King Jeongjo\u2019s respect and love for his father. Both Geolleung and Yungneung are designated as Historic Site No. 206."},{"id":"2022-07-28-1659019302389","title":"Andong Dam (\uc548\ub3d9\ub310)","imgUrl":"/2022-07-28-1659019302389/178306_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-07-28-1659019302389","description":"Andong Dam is a multipurpose dam on the Nakdonggang River.
