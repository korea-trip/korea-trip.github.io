During the final days of Baekje Kingdom, a man who was the only son and heir of a family for seven generations was seriously wounded during a war with Silla. His mother worried greatly over her son‚Äôs wounds.  <br><br>One day she saw a crane with a wounded wing dip itself into a hot spring in the midst of snow covered ground and healed.  She took her son there and his wound was healed as well so the legend goes.  Perhaps because of this legend, the Yuseong Hot Springs is famous for its incredible healing properties.","regDate":"2022-08-14","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Daejeon","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Hot Springs & Spa"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-14-1660449904650/1885424_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Daejeon/2022-08-14-1660449904650","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Daejeon/2022-08-14-1660449904650"},{"id":"2022-08-14-1660445519037","title":"Uam Historic Park (Ïö∞ÏïîÏÇ¨Ï†ÅÍ≥µÏõê)","description":"Uam Historic Park opened in 1998 at the site where Uam Song Si-yeol (1607-1689), a renowned Confucian scholar from the late Joseon period, meditated on his studies.
