The park is one of the largest film and television studio sets in Korea.<br><br>The theme park is located in Gahori, Yongju-myeon (Hapcheon) and covers an area of over 231,406.00㎡. It is divided into two main sets separately owned by the major broadcasting companies KBS and MBC. The section owned by KBS houses reproductions of Seoul landmarks such as Seoul Station, Chosun Governor-General Office, and the Bando Hotel, as they appeared from the 1930s to the 1960s. MBC’s set focuses mainly on reproductions of streets from Sogong-dong, Seoul from the 1970s and 80s. A walk around this major filming location will transport visitors back into the Seoul of yore, a Seoul vastly different from the one people know and love today.<br><br>After a set is used for a film or a soap opera, the City of Hapcheon remodels and displays it as a type of exhibit, chronicling the area’s anthropologic development.

Only hikers with stamina can trail the course from Baengmu-dong to Hansingyegok Valley to Seseok.
