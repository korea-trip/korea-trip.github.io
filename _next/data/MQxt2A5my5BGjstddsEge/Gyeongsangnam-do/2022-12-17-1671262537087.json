Well-known films and soap operas include Seoul 1945, Fighter in the Wind, Gyeongseong Scandals, Meeting Plaza, Dachimawa Lee, Modern Boy and East of Eden. The park is one of the largest film and television studio sets in Korea.<br><br>The theme park is located in Gahori, Yongju-myeon (Hapcheon) and covers an area of over 231,406.00„é°. It is divided into two main sets separately owned by the major broadcasting companies KBS and MBC. The section owned by KBS houses reproductions of Seoul landmarks such as Seoul Station, Chosun Governor-General Office, and the Bando Hotel, as they appeared from the 1930s to the 1960s. MBC‚Äôs set focuses mainly on reproductions of streets from Sogong-dong, Seoul from the 1970s and 80s. A walk around this major filming location will transport visitors back into the Seoul of yore, a Seoul vastly different from the one people know and love today.<br><br>After a set is used for a film or a soap opera, the City of Hapcheon remodels and displays it as a type of exhibit, chronicling the area‚Äôs anthropologic development. In the future, the city plans to expand exhibits to include a facility where visitors can view a collection of historic military pieces.<br>&nbsp;<br>","regDate":"2022-12-19","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Theme Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-19-1671435346356/1867863_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-19-1671435346356"},{"id":"2022-12-19-1671431982703","title":"Hapcheon Haeinsa Temple (Ìï¥Ïù∏ÏÇ¨ (Ìï©Ï≤ú))","description":"Haeinsa Temple is one of Koreas three largest temples, and was founded during the third year of King Ae-jangs reign (802) by two monks Suneung and Ijung.

Only hikers with stamina can trail the course from Baengmu-dong to Hansingyegok Valley to Seseok. During the summer season, the valley area is an optimal vacationing spot due to its thick forests and cold, clear water. It‚Äôs a great spot for seeing the autumn foliage and for hiking in the winter snow.","regDate":"2022-12-19","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Valleys"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-19-1671428172263/1978663_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-19-1671428172263"},{"id":"2022-12-19-1671424744273","title":"Hansando Island (ÌïúÏÇ∞ÎèÑ)","description":"Hansando Island is located in the middle of Hallyeohaesang National Park.
