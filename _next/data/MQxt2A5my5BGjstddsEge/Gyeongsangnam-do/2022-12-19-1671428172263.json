Due to its tough topography, Hansingyegok Valley has been less visited and thus still has rather untouched forests. Only hikers with stamina can trail the course from Baengmu-dong to Hansingyegok Valley to Seseok. During the summer season, the valley area is an optimal vacationing spot due to its thick forests and cold, clear water. It‚Äôs a great spot for seeing the autumn foliage and for hiking in the winter snow.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-55-970-1000|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Parking Fees:|*Up to first 1 hr: <br>Compact cars 500 won / mid to small sized cars 1,100 won / large vehicles 2,000 won<br>*After exceeding 1 hr limit (for every additional 10 min.): <br>Compact cars 100 won / mid to small sized cars 250-300 won / large vehicles 400-500 won<br><br>[Fixed rate] <br>Compact cars 2,000 won <br>mid to small sized cars 4,000~5,000 won <br>large vehicles 6,000~7,500 won <br>* Regular shuttle buses are exception (monthly parking users are charged separately.)|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-19-1671428172263/1978664_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-19-1671428172263/1978664_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-19-1671428172263/1978666_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-19-1671428172263/1978666_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-19-1671428172263/1978669_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-19-1671428172263/1978669_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-19-1671428172263/1978671_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-19-1671428172263/1978671_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-55-970-1000](tel:+82559701000)\n- [üè†http://jiri.knps.or.kr ](http://jiri.knps.or.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.3643829052\nlongitude: 127.6805736086\ntitle: Gangcheong-gil, Macheon-myeon, Hamyang-gun, Gyeongsangnam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \nFrom Dong Seoul Bus Terminal, take a bus to Hamyang Bus Terminal.\nFrom Hamyang Bus Terminal Bus Stop, take a bus headed for Baengmu-dong.\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-19-1671428172263","title":"Hansingyegok Valley (Baengmudonggyegok Valley) (ÌïúÏã†Í≥ÑÍ≥°(Î∞±Î¨¥ÎèôÍ≥ÑÍ≥°))","description":"Located in Hamyang-gun, Gyeongnam, Hansingyegok Valley starts from Chotdaebong Peak and Yeongsinbong Peak of Jirisan Mountain, runs down to meet with Hansinjigyegok Valley at Ganesopokpo Falls and continues on to Baengmu-dong.

The park is one of the largest film and television studio sets in Korea.<br><br>The theme park is located in Gahori, Yongju-myeon (Hapcheon) and covers an area of over 231,406.00„é°. It is divided into two main sets separately owned by the major broadcasting companies KBS and MBC. The section owned by KBS houses reproductions of Seoul landmarks such as Seoul Station, Chosun Governor-General Office, and the Bando Hotel, as they appeared from the 1930s to the 1960s. MBC‚Äôs set focuses mainly on reproductions of streets from Sogong-dong, Seoul from the 1970s and 80s. A walk around this major filming location will transport visitors back into the Seoul of yore, a Seoul vastly different from the one people know and love today.<br><br>After a set is used for a film or a soap opera, the City of Hapcheon remodels and displays it as a type of exhibit, chronicling the area‚Äôs anthropologic development.
