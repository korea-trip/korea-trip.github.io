The last fire took place in December of 1914, burning down all the buildings except Daeyangru Pavilion; therefore, most of the current buildings are historical representations of the buildings previously destroyed in the fire.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-55-853-0283|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-30-1659213531959/2372749_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659213531959/2372749_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659213531959/2372754_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659213531959/2372754_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659213531959/2372755_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659213531959/2372755_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659213531959/2372757_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659213531959/2372757_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659213531959/2372758_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659213531959/2372758_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-55-853-0283](tel:+82558530283)\n- [üè†www.dasolsa.kr](http://www.dasolsa.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.0831882320\nlongitude: 127.9199487926\ntitle: 417, Dasolsa-gil, Sacheon-si, Gyeongsangnam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Express/Intercity Bus]<br>\nTake a bus from Seoul Express Bus Terminal to Jinju Bus Terminal.<br><br>\n\n[Taxi]<br>\nApprox. 30 min from Jinju Bus Terminal.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-30-1659213531959","title":"Dasolsa Temple (Îã§ÏÜîÏÇ¨)","description":"Located on the hillside of Imyeongsan Mountain in Sacheon, Gyeongsangnam-do, Dasolsa Temple is a very old Buddhist temple built during the Silla dynasty.

The flat part of the peak (the turtle‚Äôs ‚Äúhead‚Äù) is home to the Tomb of King Suro. On the summit is a southern-style dolmen dating back to the 4th century BC that consists of 5 or 6 support stones and a large cover stone measuring 2.5m in diameter. The cover stone bears the inscription ‚ÄúGujibongseok,‚Äù said to be written by Han Ho. <br><br>Gujibong Peak is considered a sacred place by the local people because, according to legend, it is the place where the creation of the Gaya Kingdom took place. During the Japanese colonial rule, the ‚Äúneck‚Äù of the turtle was destroyed by the construction of a mountain road. Years later, a pedestrian road was built to rejoin the neck and restore the feng shui of the mountain.","regDate":"2022-12-17","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-17-1671259044305/749962_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-17-1671259044305"},{"id":"2022-12-17-1671255373596","title":"Gimhae Eunhasa Temple (ÏùÄÌïòÏÇ¨(ÍπÄÌï¥))","description":"Eunhasa Temple is located in Sineosan Mountain in Gimhae, Gyeongsangnam-do.

The observatory is shaped like an egg, in memory of the legend of King Kim Suro, the founder of the Garak Kingdom, according to which the king was born from an egg. <Br><br>It is said that the queen of King Suro, Heo Hwang-ok, was a princess from the Indian country of Ayuta. Since sophisticated navigation equipment had yet to be invented, it can be assumed that she found her way to the Garak Kingdom by following the stars. It is also said that a prince of the Garak Kingdom built an observatory on the highest point of a mud fortress in Jinrye in order to make astronomical observations. The place is still referred to as Bibidan, which means a place to watch the stars. <Br><br>These historical facts indicate the stars were very important to the Gaya, an ancient kingdom established mainly in the Gimhae area.
