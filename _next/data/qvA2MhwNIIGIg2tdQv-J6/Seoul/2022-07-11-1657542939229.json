Lee Jip was a loyal government official during the reign of King Gongmin during the late Goryeo dynasty. He was forced to move to an underground tunnel in the southwest side of Iljasan Mountain to avoid entrapment by Shin Don, a person of influence at the time. While living in hiding, he took the pen-name Dunchon (meaning drawing back to the countryside) to symbolize the hardships he was going through. The nearby area was named after him, being called Dunchon-dong.","regDate":"2022-08-04","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659488_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-08-04-1659589577365"},{"id":"2022-08-04-1659584576844","title":"Ichon Hangang Park (ÌïúÍ∞ïÏãúÎØºÍ≥µÏõê Ïù¥Ï¥åÏßÄÍµ¨(Ïù¥Ï¥åÌïúÍ∞ïÍ≥µÏõê))","description":"Ichon Hangang Park is located on the northern side of the river between Jungnangcheongyo Bridge and Wonhyodaegyo Bridge.
