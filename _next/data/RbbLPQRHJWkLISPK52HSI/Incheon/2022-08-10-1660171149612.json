The park first opened in June 1999 at the site of an old saltern on a 660,000 ㎡ plot but has expanded over the years to an area of 3.5 million ㎡. The previous salt storage has been converted into an ecology exhibition space, displaying the history of the area as well as the plants and animals that live here. The park expanded in April 2001 with the addition of the Ecology Hall and Nature Learning Center, offering various educational experience opportunities. The walking paths by the salt storage and the windmill are especially popular photo points. Many people visit in fall for the shimmering silver grass, said to appear in many colors depending on the lighting.
