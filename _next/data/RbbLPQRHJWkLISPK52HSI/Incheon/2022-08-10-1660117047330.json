The previous salt storage has been converted into an ecology exhibition space, displaying the history of the area as well as the plants and animals that live here. The park expanded in April 2001 with the addition of the Ecology Hall and Nature Learning Center, offering various educational experience opportunities. The walking paths by the salt storage and the windmill are especially popular photo points.
