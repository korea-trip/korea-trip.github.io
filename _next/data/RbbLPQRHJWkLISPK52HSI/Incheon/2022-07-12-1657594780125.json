In the past, the island was called Ijeokdo Island because it served as a hideout for pirates. The sea, mountain, and shoal exist in harmony.<br>\n<br>\n The beauty of Daeijakdo Island comes from the view of the blue ocean from the peak of Buasan Mountain and the shoal that only appears during low tide. The shoal almost reaches Soijakdo Island and creates a large field of sand. The shoal is also called <em>pulchi</em> and only appears during low tide for six hours a day.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>• For more info: +82-32-851-888|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-12-1657594780125/2661904_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-12-1657594780125/2661904_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-12-1657594780125/2661906_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-12-1657594780125/2661906_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-12-1657594780125/2661907_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-12-1657594780125/2661907_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-12-1657594780125/2661908_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-12-1657594780125/2661908_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-32-851-888](tel:+8232851888)\n- [🏠daeijakdo.kr](http://daeijakdo.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.1749176125\nlongitude: 126.2587835301\ntitle: Ijak-ri, Ongjin-gun, Incheon\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Ferry]<br>\nTake a ferry from Incheon Passenger Port Terminal to the island.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-12-1657594780125","title":"Daeijakdo Island (대이작도)","description":"Ijakdo Island is made up of Daeijakdo Island and Soijakdo Island.

The park first opened in June 1999 at the site of an old saltern on a 660,000 ㎡ plot but has expanded over the years to an area of 3.5 million ㎡. The previous salt storage has been converted into an ecology exhibition space, displaying the history of the area as well as the plants and animals that live here. The park expanded in April 2001 with the addition of the Ecology Hall and Nature Learning Center, offering various educational experience opportunities. The walking paths by the salt storage and the windmill are especially popular photo points. Many people visit in fall for the shimmering silver grass, said to appear in many colors depending on the lighting. The park amenities, including rest areas and benches, make the park a popular destination for families and couples.","regDate":"2022-08-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Nature","Natural Sites","Eco-Tourism Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-12-1660304118232/2675544_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-08-12-1660304118232"},{"id":"2022-08-12-1660301036287","title":"Songwol-dong Fairy Tale Village (송월동 동화마을)","description":"Songwol-dong was named for its view of the moon between the pine forest.

The clean, sandy beach stretches out beautifully against the backdrop of a lush pine tree forest so dense that it does not let daylight in, even at midday. Facing the beach is Silmido Island, the location for the filming of Silmido (2003), a Korean movie based on the tragic story of Korean Special Ops Unit 684. The film set, however, was demolished after the shooting. The pathway to the island, which has no residents, can be shown during low tide. Therefore, visitors should be aware of the tidal times to know when they can cross back to the mainland.","regDate":"2022-08-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-12-1660280190872/190690_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-08-12-1660280190872"},{"id":"2022-08-12-1660277185177","title":"Seonnyeo Rock (선녀바위)","description":"Seonnyeo Rock is located near the Seoul metropolitan area, in the northern part of Yongyudo Island, past Masian Beach.

The beach is also popular among tourists at sunset, when the fading sun colors the sea around the rock.<br> On the other side is a small dock and old fishing boats. This beach is less crowded than Wangsan Beach or those in Eurwang-ri, making it the perfect spot for swimming and camping. <br> There is a pretty cafe up the hill from the rock and it is a great place for enjoying the ocean scenery with a cup of tea. On the other side of the cafe is a garden with pine trees, yet another beautiful spot to watch the sunset.","regDate":"2022-08-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Nature","Natural Resources","Rocks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-12-1660277185177/1826990_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-08-12-1660277185177"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
