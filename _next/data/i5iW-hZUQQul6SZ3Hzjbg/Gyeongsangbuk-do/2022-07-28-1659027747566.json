The forest is thickly populated by ancient zelkova and willow trees rooted on gently sloping hills and along the small stream in the northwest part of the woods. According to legend, the forest is closely associated with myths surrounding the birth of Alji, the founder of the Gyeongju Kim clan. As such, it is designated national Historic Site No. 19. <br>Legend has it that King Talhae heard a rooster crying from deep inside the Sirim Woods. Chancellor Hogong was sent to investigate. Upon arriving, he found a rooster crying underneath a tree on which hung a golden box. Hogong immediately reported his find to the king, who instructed him to bring the golden box into the palace. The king opened the box and found a small child inside, Kim Alji. The forest, which had previously been called ‚ÄòSirim‚Äô or ‚ÄòGurim‚Äô, became known as ‚ÄòGyerim‚Äô, (gye‚Äô meaning rooster). The name Gyerim was also used to refer to the Silla kingdom. <br>Alji was adopted as the king‚Äôs son, but because the crown was passed on to King Pasa of the Park family, he never ascended the throne. The Kim clan later became the royal bloodline with the coronation of King Naemul some years later. <br> The memorial stone recording the birth of Kim Alji was erected in the third year of King Sunjos rule in the Joseon dynasty. Located close to the royal fortress of Silla, the forest is still deeply revered as the mystical birthplace of the first ancestor of the royal Kim clan of Silla. Yellow canola blossoms along the path connecting Daereungwon with Gyerim and Banwolseong only add to the magical ambiance of the forest.","regDate":"2022-11-28","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-28-1669613785218/2493186_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-11-28-1669613785218"},{"id":"2022-11-28-1669610583651","title":"Gyeongju Golgulsa Temple (Í≥®Íµ¥ÏÇ¨ (Í≤ΩÏ£º))","description":"Located at the foot of Hamwolsan Mountain, Golgulsa Temple houses twelve caves in a tall cliff, with a rock-carved statue of Buddha sitting at the highest point. Although the main temple hall may seem like an ordinary building with its tile roof and walls, the ceiling and the walls are all part of a cave. Some caves are very small, large enough to allow only one person to sit in, while some are spacious enough to provide room for three to four people. From statues of young monks to old and wise monks, a variety of rock-carved sculptures can be seen placed throughout the caves. The caves are connected by steep stairs carved into the cliff, leading all the way to the top. The Buddha statue situated at the top of the cliff is designated as Treasure No. 581 and is 4 meters in x_height and 2.2 meters in x_width. Unfortunately, this granite statue has gone through deterioration over time and a glass roof is built over the statue to prevent further damage. Golgulsa Temple offers training programs as well as a Templestay program for both domestic travelers and tourists from abroad.","regDate":"2022-11-28","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-28-1669610583651/202535_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-11-28-1669610583651"},{"id":"2022-11-28-1669607257763","title":"Gyeongju Folk Craft Village (Í≤ΩÏ£ºÎØºÏÜçÍ≥µÏòàÏ¥å)","description":"Gyeongju Folk Craft Village consists of 40 thatched and tile-roofed houses, lived in by local artisans of traditional arts and crafts skills.
