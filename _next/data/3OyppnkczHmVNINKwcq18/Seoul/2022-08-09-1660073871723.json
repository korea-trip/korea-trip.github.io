At that time, each restaurant had its own DJ booth, with the image of the 'cool DJ' who played the music becoming a symbol of Sindang-dong Tteokbokki Town. In addition, this period also marked the prime time of high school baseball where students would crowd the streets on days when Duksoo Commercial High School and Sunrin Commercial High School (now Sunrin Internet High School) played against one another. Although these high school students have aged, they continue to visit the area, reliving their youth and continuing to indulge in the specialty tteokbokki.<br><br>\n\nHowever, some claim the history of this alley began in the 1950s. The owner of Mabongnim Halmeoni Tteokbokki restaurant says tteokbokki was being sold as early as 1953 as the area used to be home to Donga Theater and she sold tteokbokki, corn and potatoes to those visiting the theater. At first, tteokbokki was simply made with gochu jang but as time went by, cooks decided the dish could be more than just a snack. By adding ingredients like eggs, cellophane noodles, fish cakes, instant noodles and more recently squid, prawn and cheese, tteokbokki can be made more delicious and turns this beloved snack into a full meal.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-2-2236-9135|\n|parking:|Available at each restaurant|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-09-1660073871723/1840719_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-09-1660073871723/1840719_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-09-1660073871723/1840720_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-09-1660073871723/1840720_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-09-1660073871723/2660047_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-09-1660073871723/2660047_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-09-1660073871723/2660048_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-09-1660073871723/2660048_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-09-1660073871723/2660050_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-09-1660073871723/2660050_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-2-2236-9135](tel:+82222369135)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5629969719\nlongitude: 127.0145678348\ntitle: 10-18, Dasan-ro 33-gil, Jung-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway]<br>\nSindang Station (Seoul Subway Line 2 or 6), Exit 8.<br>\nGo straight until you reach Jungbu Fire Station and turn left.<br><br>\n\nCheonggu Station (Seoul Subway Line 6), Exit 1.<br>\nTurn right when you arrive at the playground and go straight for 200m.\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-09-1660073871723","title":"Sindang-dong Tteokbokki Town (신당동떡볶이골목)","description":"Sindang-dongTteokbokki Town started in the late 70s, although the alley did not become famous until the 80s.

The park is also important for being the starting point for the March 1 Independence Movement in Seoul. The original name of the park was Pagoda Park, but was changed to the current Tapgol Park on May 28, 1992. The park contains several monuments and heritages, including the Ten-story Stone Pagoda of Wongaksa Temple Site (National Treasure), Stele for the Construction of Daewongaksa Temple at Wongaksa Temple Site (Treasure), and Palgakjeong Pavilion, where the Independence Proclamation was first declared; the independence movement relief plate; and the statue of Son Byeong-hee.","regDate":"2022-08-10","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-10-1660114076645/2601459_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-08-10-1660114076645"},{"id":"2022-08-10-1660109832357","title":"Taereung and Gangneung Royal Tombs [UNESCO World Heritage] (서울 태릉과 강릉 [유네스코 세계문화유산])","description":"Designated as a Historic Site, Taereung & Gangneung Royal Tombs is comprised of two tombs.
