Located to the right of the pavilion building (northeast of the building) is Hancheongak Pavilion, which has unique roof. To the west of the pavilion is Sauhoegwan Hall that was built with reinforced concrete.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-2-738-5785|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-02-1659468989162/1568121_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659468989162/1568121_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659468989162/1568122_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659468989162/1568122_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659468989162/1568123_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659468989162/1568123_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659468989162/1568126_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659468989162/1568126_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659468989162/2530939_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659468989162/2530939_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659468989162/2530956_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659468989162/2530956_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659468989162/2530957_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659468989162/2530957_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659468989162/2530960_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659468989162/2530960_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659468989162/2530961_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659468989162/2530961_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659468989162/1568124_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659468989162/1568124_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-2-738-5785](tel:+8227385785)\n- [üè†www.hwanghakjeong.org](http://www.hwanghakjeong.org)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5776027007\nlongitude: 126.9640359154\ntitle: 15-32, Sajik-ro 9-gil, Jongno-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway]<br>\nGyeongbokgung Station (Seoul Subway Line 3), Exit 1.<br>\n Go straight for 160m and take a right and then take a left again at the three way intersection. <BR>Continue walking for 112m and the venue will be on the right.\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-02-1659468989162","title":"Hwanghakjeong Pavilion (Ìô©ÌïôÏ†ï)","description":"Hwanghakjeong Pavilion was built in 1898 by decree of King Gojong‚Äôs.
