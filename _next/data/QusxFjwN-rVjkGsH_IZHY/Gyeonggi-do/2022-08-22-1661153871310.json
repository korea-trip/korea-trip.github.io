The Daebudo area is also famous for its local specialties: short-necked clams and oysters on Yukdo, fermented turban shells and natural dunggeulle tea on Pungdo, and bajirak kalguksu (noodle with short-necked clams) on Daebudo.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-1899-1720|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-22-1661153871310/1589639_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-22-1661153871310/1589639_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-22-1661153871310/1589641_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-22-1661153871310/1589641_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-22-1661153871310/1806700_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-22-1661153871310/1806700_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-22-1661153871310/1939897_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-22-1661153871310/1939897_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-1899-1720](tel:+8218991720)\n- [üè†tourinfo.iansan.net](http://tourinfo.iansan.net/main.do)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.2437208608\nlongitude: 126.5852713772\ntitle: 1531, Daebuhwanggeum-ro, Danwon-gu, Ansan-si, Gyeonggi-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>\nOido Station (Seoul Subway Line 4), Exit 2.<br>\nCross the road and take Bus No. 790 to Bukdong 3-way Intersection Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-22-1661153871310","title":"Daebudo Island (ÎåÄÎ∂ÄÎèÑ)","description":"Called the Hawaii of Ansan, Daebudo Island is connected to the mainland through the Sihwa Embankment.
