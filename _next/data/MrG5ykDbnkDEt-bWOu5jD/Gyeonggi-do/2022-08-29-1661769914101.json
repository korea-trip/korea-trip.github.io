This is truly a front-line observation post on the DMZ. The No. 1 Tunnel is not open to the public since it is located in the Demilitarized Zone. However, a life-size model has been created and is on exhibit at the Sangseung OP, the closest observation post. <br><br>The No. 1 Tunnel was discovered on November 15, 1974, by Sergeant Koo Hasa when his reconnaissance team sensed suspicious steam rising from the ground. After a few gunshots from a guard post in North Korea, Koo‚Äôs team started the investigation. It turned out that the tunnel was made by North Korean soldiers to infiltrate and aid in the invasion of the South.","regDate":"2022-09-05","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Security & Peace Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-05-1662367563245/2007030_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-09-05-1662367563245"},{"id":"2022-09-05-1662364166676","title":"Saneum National Recreational Forest (Íµ≠Î¶Ω ÏÇ∞ÏùåÏûêÏó∞Ìú¥ÏñëÎ¶º)","description":"Saneum National Recreational Forest is located in Danwol-myeon in Yangpyeong.
