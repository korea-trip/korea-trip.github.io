Metasequoia trees were planted along the street in the early 1970s by the Ministry of Internal Affairs after National Road 24 was rebuilt. At that time, the saplings were only 3 to 4 years old and their branches stretched sparsely out into the sky; now, the trees have grown so high that they seem to block out the sun. Thanks to these stately trees, in 2002 the Korea Forest Service selected the boulevard as one of the most beautiful roads in Korea. The 8.5-kilometer-long boulevard is one of the most popular driving routes in Korea, especially during summer when the trees&rsquo; lush green leaves are at their x_height of beauty.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-61-380-3149|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|The day of Seollal (Lunar New Year‚Äôs Day) & Chuseok (Korean Thanksgiving Day)|\n|usetime:|May-August: 09:00-19:00<br>September-April: 09:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Film Locations:|Films \"Wanee & Junah (2001),\" \"May 18 (2007)\"<br />Variety program \"1 Night, 2 Days\"|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Gallery, cafe, etc.|\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 2,000 won / Teenagers 1,000 won / Children 700 won<br>Groups - Adults 1,600 won / Teenagers 700 won / Children 500 won<br><br>* Group: 20 or more people<br>* Free admission: Preschoolers (ages 6 & under), senior citizens (ages 65 & over)|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-16-1673865516648/2515888_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-16-1673865516648/2515888_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-16-1673865516648/2515986_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-16-1673865516648/2515986_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-16-1673865516648/2515989_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-16-1673865516648/2515989_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-16-1673865516648/2515991_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-16-1673865516648/2515991_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-61-380-3149](tel:+82613803149)\n- [üè†\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Îã¥ÏñëÍµ∞ Î¨∏ÌôîÍ¥ÄÍ¥ë ÏÇ¨Ïù¥Ìä∏Î°ú Ïù¥Îèô\">tour.damyang.go.kr](http://www.damyang.go.kr/tour/board/view.damyang?boardId=BBS_0000169&menuCd=DOM_000000301001001000&paging=ok&startPage=1&dataSid=319428<br>)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.3238535634\nlongitude: 127.0041510748\ntitle: 12, Metasequoia-ro, Damyang-gun, Jeollanam-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-16-1673865516648","title":"Damyang Metasequoia-lined Road (Îã¥Ïñë Î©îÌÉÄÏÑ∏ÏøºÏù¥ÏïÑÍ∏∏)","description":"Damyang Metasequoia-lined Road is one of Koreas most beautiful paths.
