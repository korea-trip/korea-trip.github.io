The trademark image of the island is Jjangttungeo Bridge, a 470-meter-long wooden bridge built above the mud flat. The bridge allows visitors to observe mud creatures all without stepping foot in the mud. The jjangttungeo (mudskipper) is only able to live in clean mud flats and they are easily found in this island. The name of the bridge comes from the image of many mudskippers jumping around the bridge. During low tide, the vast mud flat appears, as well as various mud organisms including mudskippers, crabs, clams and lug worms. When the tide is high, crossing this bridge will give the feeling of walking on water. The sight seen from the bridge is perfect for a date course, and the bridge leads to Ujeong Beach, which offers a beautiful view of the setting sun.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available (Next to Jeungdo Slow City Tourism Information Center)|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-24-1674552966306/2612382_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-24-1674552966306/2612382_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-24-1674552966306/2612384_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-24-1674552966306/2612384_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-24-1674552966306/2617974_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-24-1674552966306/2617974_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-24-1674552966306/2617975_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-24-1674552966306/2617975_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 34.9910878394\nlongitude: 126.1358695722\ntitle: Daecho-ri, Sinan-gun, Jeollanam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Express/Intercity Bus]<br>\nFrom Seoul Central City Express Bus Terminal, take an express bus to Gwangju U-Square Bus Terminal.<br>\nFrom Gwangju U-Square Bus Terminal, take an express bus to Jido Express Bus Terminal.<br><br>\n\n[Local Bus]<br>\nFrom Jido Express Bus Terminal, take a bus bound for Jeungdo to Jeungdo-myeon.<br>\nTake a bus or a taxi from Jeungdo-myeon to Jjangttungeo Bridge.\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-24-1674552966306","title":"Jjangttungeo (Mudskipper) Bridge (짱뚱어다리)","description":"Featuring natural areas untouched by human hands, Jeungdo Island in Sinan-gun was the first Slow City designated in Asia as of December 1, 2007.
