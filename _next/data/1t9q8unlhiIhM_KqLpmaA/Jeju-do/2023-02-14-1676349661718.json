The length of the island is 3.8 kilometers and the circumference is 17 kilometers. People have lived in Udo Island since the Joseon period, with most living as a farmer or working in the fishing industry. The island boasts fertile soil, abundant schools of fish, and scenic sights; local heritages (female divers, stone walls, and stone tombs) as well as natural attractions abound on the island, making it a miniature of Jeju Island. The island is also full of amenities and tourism outlets  fishing, bike trails, sand massages, submarine tours and cruises. At the highest point of the island, Udobong Peak (alt. 132 meters), visitors can see a panoramic view of the island as well as Seongsan Ilchulbong Tuff Cone and the main island. Rhodolith Beach (a white beach designated Natural Monument) has appeared regularly in films and TV commercials thanks to its breathtaking white sand and emerald sea. The sea around the beach showcases different colors depending on the water level. This makes Rhodolith Beach one of the most popular tourist attractions in Jeju-do, along with Hallasan Mountain. To protect the exquisite nature and promote maritime tourism, Bukjeju County designated two ports on the island (Udo Port and Haumokdong Port) and the sea surrounding it (25,863 „é¢) as Udo Maritime Park in January 2001. Visitors can appreciate maritime tourism at its best including a trip under the sea by submarine.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br> ‚Ä¢ Jeju Travel Hotline: +82-64-740-6000|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Film Locations:|Movie \"Little Mermaid (2004)\"|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-02-14-1676349661718/2364394_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-14-1676349661718/2364394_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-14-1676349661718/2364395_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-14-1676349661718/2364395_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-14-1676349661718/2364397_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-14-1676349661718/2364397_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-14-1676349661718/2364398_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-14-1676349661718/2364398_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-14-1676349661718/2364399_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-14-1676349661718/2364399_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-14-1676349661718/2654835_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-14-1676349661718/2654835_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-64-740-6000](tel:+82647406000)\n- [üè†https://www.visitjeju.net/kr/detail/view?contentsid=CONT_000000000500477\"title=\"ÏÉàÏ∞Ω: ÎπÑÏßìÏ†úÏ£º\"target=\"_blank\"><br>www.visitjeju.net](<br>https://www.visitjeju.net/kr/detail/view?contentsid=CONT_000000000500477)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.5065059625\nlongitude: 126.9533995648\ntitle: 153, Udo-ro, Jeju-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2023-02-14-1676349661718","title":"Udo Island - Udo Maritime Park (Ïö∞ÎèÑ(Ìï¥ÏñëÎèÑÎ¶ΩÍ≥µÏõê))","description":"Situated 3.8 kilometers off the northeast coast of Jeju Island, Udo Island was named because it resembles a lying cow.

The whole island was designated as a special tourist zone, and wherever tourists go, they can look upon beautiful scenery. Every year, about 8.7 million people from Korea and abroad visit this fascinating island that measures 73 kilometers across, east to west, and 31 kilometers, from north to south.<br>Jeju Island earned the UNESCO triple crown, being designated as a World Natural Heritage, Global Geopark, and Biosphere Reserve as well as one of the Seven Wonders of Nature. The climate of Jeju is quite different from the temperate climate of mainland Korea. Since the island has a subtropical climate as well as a subarctic one, there are many peculiar plants that can only to be found on this island. The unique sight of Jeju Island captivates travelers. The scenery that represents this volcanic island of Jeju, such as Jusangjeolli Cliff (columnar joints on the coast) were created by Hallasan Mountain and Oreum (parasitic cones in Jeju dialect). The piedmont area that visitors encounter on their way from the beach to Hallasan Mountain is a gift of nature and the piedmont area on the way to Geomunoreum Volcanic Cone, where Jeju World Natural Heritage Center is located, is worth seeing. Another unique aspect here is the Jeju dialect and lifestyle.<br>Traveling the 182-kilometer circuit road along the coastline by car, motor scooter or bike is recommended. There is a trail for walking called ‚ÄúJeju Olle-gil‚Äù for those who choose to make a round trip on foot.
