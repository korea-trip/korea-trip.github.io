Gasansan Mountain (901m in elevation) is 10 kilometers west of Palgongsan Mountain. Because it boasts seven peaks, the mountain was called Chilbongsan Mountain. After enduring foreign invasions, including the Imjin War (1592-1598) and the Qing invasion of Joseon (1636), the Joseon rulers built a fortress over the course of 100 years to aid in Korea’s defense. It is Korea’s only three-layered fortress, consisting of inner, outer and central walls. The flat Gasanbawi Rock at the mountain’s peak, which is large enough to accommodate 100 people at a time, offers a great view of Daegu Metropolitan City.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<BR> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-54-979-6452|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Hiking Course:|* South Gate → 1km → East Gate → 1.9km → Inner Gate → 0.3km → Gasan Rock → 1.7km → Hakmyeongdong <br> * Hakmyeongdong → 1.7km → Gasan Rock → 0.5km → North Gate → 0.5km → Inner Gate → 5.5km → South Gate → 1.2km → Giseongdong → 3km → Songnimsa Temple |\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-30-1659149570991/1053853_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659149570991/1053853_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659149570991/1053854_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659149570991/1053854_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659149570991/1053863_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659149570991/1053863_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659149570991/692167_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659149570991/692167_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659149570991/692170_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659149570991/692170_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659149570991/693029_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659149570991/693029_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659149570991/693032_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659149570991/693032_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-54-979-6452](tel:+82549796452)\n- [🏠tour.chilgok.go.kr</a> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br><a href=\"http://www.cha.go.kr/\" target=\"_blank\">www.cha.go.kr](http://tour.chilgok.go.kr/main/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.0431139942\nlongitude: 128.5813368583\ntitle: Gasan-ri, Chilgok-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>\nFrom Seoul Express Bus Terminal, take an express bus to Seo Daegu Express Bus Terminal.<br>From Seo Daegu Express Bus Terminal, go 230m straight towards Manpyeong Negeori and go 60m towards Gasan, and cross the street.<br>Take Bus Chilgok 3 and get off at Bangteokgol Bus Stop.<br>Walk for approx. 500m towards Palgongsan Information Center.<br>Hike up Palgongsan Mountain to arrive at Gasansanseong Fortress and Gasanbawi Rock.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-30-1659149570991","title":"Chilgok Gasansanseong Fortress and Gasanbawi Rock (칠곡 가산산성 및 가산바위)","description":"Gasansanseong Fortress in Chilgok-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do is located in the middle of Chilgok-gun, between Daegu Metropolitan City and Gumi.
