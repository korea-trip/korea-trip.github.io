The combination of an expansive sandy beach and indigo blue waters of the East Sea creates a splendid view, drawing a large number of vacationers in the summer. <br><br>Hupohang Port is the main receiving and distributing port for fish caught in the East Sea. In the early morning, the port offers a great chance to not only see fish being hauled from boats to the fish market, but also to purchase fresh raw fish at an affordable price.
