The park was registered as Private Museum No. 277 by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism in 2003. Many of the roughly 100 sculptures are realistic in style and are related to one another, creating a feeling of watching a play unfold before ones eyes. Main pieces include Farmer‚Äôs Hands, Thoughts about the Limited and the Unlimited, and The Sky in the West. The sculptures are made of marble or granite and vary in size, with some measuring 450 centimeters.<br><br>Indigenous trees and bushes of the Byeonsanbando Peninsula can be found throughout the park, giving visitors a chance to enjoy both the sculptures and the backcountry charm. The park also features the Keumkuwon Astronomical Observatory, opened in 1991. Visitors can combine their trip to the park with a visit to nearby tourist sites like Gyeokpohang Harbor, Chaeseokgang Cliff, Suseongdang Shrine, and Jeokbyeokgang Cliff.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hoteline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-63-584-6770|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Sunrise - Sunset|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Astronomical observatory|\n|Admission Fees:|Adults 2,000 won / Children 1,000 won<br /><br>* Adults (ages 13 & older) / Children (ages 4-12)|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-13-1673602566924/2513833_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-13-1673602566924/2513833_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-13-1673602566924/2513834_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-13-1673602566924/2513834_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-13-1673602566924/2513837_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-13-1673602566924/2513837_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-13-1673602566924/2513839_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-13-1673602566924/2513839_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-13-1673602566924/2513849_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-13-1673602566924/2513849_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-13-1673602566924/2513836_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-13-1673602566924/2513836_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-13-1673602566924/2513838_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-13-1673602566924/2513838_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-13-1673602566924/2513840_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-13-1673602566924/2513840_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-13-1673602566924/2513841_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-13-1673602566924/2513841_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-13-1673602566924/2513842_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-13-1673602566924/2513842_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-63-584-6770](tel:+82635846770)\n- [üè†www.keumkuwon.org](http://www.keumkuwon.org)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.6206084081\nlongitude: 126.4888782492\ntitle: 31, Jogakgongwon-gil, Buan-gun, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Taxi]<br>\nApprox. 10 min from Gyeokpo Terminal.\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-13-1673602566924","title":"Keumkuwon Sculpture Park (Í∏àÍµ¨ÏõêÏïºÏô∏Ï°∞Í∞ÅÎØ∏Ïà†Í¥Ä)","description":"Keumkuwon Sculpture Park was founded in 1966 by Kim O-seong, and was the first park of its kind in Korea.
