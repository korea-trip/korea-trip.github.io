The name Uniram refers to the steep walls of the valley where nothing but the sky, rocks, thick forests, and clouds can be seen. The valley is also befittingly named Baniram since it is so deep that it only receives direct sunlight for half the day. There are many strangely-shaped rocks like Jjokduri Rock, Cheollyeop Rock, and Daebul Rock scattered throughout the lush valley. At the peak of summer, the area is crowded with vacationers and is also popular for its autumn leaves.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-63-430-8382|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Hiking Course:|1.
