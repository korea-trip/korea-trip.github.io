The river is presently an important source of drinking water for the citizens of Ulsan. <br><br> The field around the midpoint of Taehwagang River was left abandoned for a long time before it was founded as Taehwagang National Garden, preserving nature while providing a resting spot to the citizens of Ulsan. The garden is over twice the size of Yeouido Park in Seoul, and consists of natural water and a lush bamboo forest, known as Simnidae Forest, along with canola and forage barley fields. Simnidae Forest was once in danger of demolition as part of the government's flood control plans but remains preserved thanks to community efforts. Preservation efforts led to turning the area into Taehwagang National Garden of today, which took place from 2004 to 2010.","regDate":"2022-08-20","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Ulsan","Nature","Natural Sites","Eco-Tourism Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-20-1660977784342/2653664_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Ulsan/2022-08-20-1660977784342"},{"id":"2022-08-20-1660973797364","title":"Sinbulsan Falls National Recreational Forest (국립 신불산폭포자연휴양림)","description":"Sinbulsan Falls National Recreational Forest, located at the foot of Sinbulsan Mountain, is noted for the Yeongnam Alps and the beautiful surrounding valleys.
