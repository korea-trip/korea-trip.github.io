It was originally a military camp commanded by an official with the rank of Cheomsa under the command of the Korean naval base. In 1677, an official with the rank of Manho was assigned to this camp along with 26 military officials, 100 soldiers, 2 battle ships, and other military equipment. In 1679, the Namjangpodae and Deokjinpodae batteries were stationed here. \n<br><br>\nDeokjinjin Camp was the scene of fierce battles that took place during Byeonginyangyo (the French invasion in 1866) and Shinmiyangyo (the American invasion in 1871). The battlements and gatehouse of Deokjinjin that had all been destroyed during Sinmiyangyo were restored in 1977. At the Namjangpodae Battery, cannons used by the Joseon military have been reproduced and installed for display.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-32-930-7074|\n|parking:|Available (10 bus parking spaces, 10 small vehicle spaces)|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Adults: Individuals 900 won / Groups 700 won <br> Children & Teenagers: Individuals 600 won / Groups 500 won <br> * Groups: 20 people or more <br>* Free admission: Preschoolers (ages 6 & under) with one guardian, Senior citizens (ages 65 & older), People with disabilities plus one companion (Proof required)<br> <br> * Ganghwa-gun Main Tourist Sites Discount (up to 20% discount)<br> Main tourist sites: Chojijin Fortress, Deokjinjin Fortress, Gwangseongbo Fortress, Gapgotdondae Fortification, Goryeogung Palace Site, Peace Observatory, Hwamunseok Cultural Center, Ganghwa History / Natural History Museum, Manisan Mountain, Mudflat Center, and Hamheodongcheon Stream<br> <br> - 15% discount: 3-4 sites<br> - 20% discount: 5 or more sites<br> * When choosing 8 sites or more, the ticket is valid until the next day|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Korean Info.
