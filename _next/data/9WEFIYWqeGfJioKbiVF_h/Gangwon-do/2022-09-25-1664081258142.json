Inside the Jeongmyeolbogung there is no statue of Buddha and only a wide open window. This is because it is believed that the mountain as a whole is the enshrined Jinsinsari of Buddha himself.<br><br>Beopheungsa was once a large temple where over 2,000 monks gathered. Today, most of the temple buildings were lost to a number of fires leaving only a few buildings. The pine wood path from Beopheungsa Temple to Jeongmyeolbogung is one of the most picturesque sites in the nation.
