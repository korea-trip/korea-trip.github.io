{"pageProps":{"content":"![Gaudo Island (Í∞ÄÏö∞ÎèÑ)](/2023-01-19-1674124713738/2483137_image2_1.webp)\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> Gaudo Island is the only populated island of the eight islands in Gangjinman Bay. It used to be&nbsp;part of&nbsp;Daegu-myeon until 1789 but&nbsp;later&nbsp;changed to Boam-myeon and is currently part of Doam-myeon&nbsp;since 1914 due to reorganization of administration. The name comes from its appearance in relation to Boeunsan Mountain in Ganjin-eup, which looks like&nbsp;a cow‚Äôs head. The whole island resembles a cow‚Äôs meonge (curved stick around cow‚Äôs neck&nbsp;used to&nbsp;drag farming tool) so the island became to be called Gaudo Island (Ga  Meonge in Chinese characters). <br><br> From Gaudo Island, Gangjinman Bay and uninhabited island can be seen in all directions. The coastal scenery is stunning and varied natural tourism resources grow here such as the silver magnolia, cypress colony, and Japanese black pines. Visitors can walk to the island from the mainland via a suspension bridge. When arriving to the island, a 2.5km long ecological exploring road along the mountain and coast is available. Also, fishing park which has various kinds of&nbsp;fishes is located in the spot where visitors can overlook&nbsp;at beautiful scenery of Gangjinman Bay. At the top of the island, visitors can enjoy a zip track which is an eco-friendly leisure facility, starting from Cheongja Tower (25m high).\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-61-430-3114|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Areas Open to the Public:|Jeodu Bridge: 438m / approx. 10 min walk <br />Mangho Bridge: 716m / approx. 15 min walk|\n|Hiking Course:|Hamggehae-gil (approx. 2.5km / 1hr 30 min)|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|[Infrastructure]<br>Cheongja Tower, fishing park, suspension bridge, etc.<br><br>[Convenient Facility]<br>Two restrooms, two supermarkets, etc.|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-19-1674124713738/2026870_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-19-1674124713738/2026870_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-19-1674124713738/2026874_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-19-1674124713738/2026874_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-19-1674124713738/2026875_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-19-1674124713738/2026875_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-19-1674124713738/2370971_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-19-1674124713738/2370971_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-19-1674124713738/2483138_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-19-1674124713738/2483138_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-19-1674124713738/2483140_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-19-1674124713738/2483140_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-19-1674124713738/2483161_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-19-1674124713738/2483161_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-19-1674124713738/2483163_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-19-1674124713738/2483163_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-19-1674124713738/2483118_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-19-1674124713738/2483118_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-19-1674124713738/2483158_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-19-1674124713738/2483158_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-61-430-3114](tel:+82614303114)\n- [üè†www.gaudo.co](http://www.gaudo.co)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 34.5283725869\nlongitude: 126.7726522891\ntitle: 473, Wolgot-ro, Gangjin-gun, Jeollanam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Seoul Central City Bus Terminal, take a bus to Gangjin Bus Terminal.<br>\nFrom Gangjin Bus Terminal Bus Stop, take a Nongeochon Bus bound for Maryang and get off at Jeodu Village Bus Stop.<br>\nCross the bridge to reach the island.\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-19-1674124713738","title":"Gaudo Island (Í∞ÄÏö∞ÎèÑ)","description":"Gaudo Island is the only populated island of the eight islands in Gangjinman Bay.

The original building burned down near the end of the war, and Admiral Yi Sun-sins successor, Yi Si-eon, constructed Jinnamgwan Hall, a large <em>gaeksa</em> (government officer guesthouse) at the site in 1599.<br /><br />Jinnamgwan Hall is a single-story gable-roofed building with 15 <em>kan</em> (traditional Korean measurement between two pillars) on the front and 5 kan on the sides. It is the largest single-story goverment building from the Joseon dynasty in the region. At the hall entrance is a small museum outlining the history of Jinnamgwan and the Imjin War, and the famous Yeosu Stone Statue (Jeollanam-do Tangible Cultural Asset) is located within the precincts of the hall.

Unfortunately, most of the temple buildings have been destroyed and only the main hall, Daeungjeon Hall, and a few smaller structures such as the living quarters remain on site today. The temple was originally called Ssanggyesa Temple because the waters of two valleys meet in front of this temple. It was renamed Jeongsusa Temple during the latter part of the Joseon dynasty (1392-1905).<br><br>The temple was reportedly established by the state monk Doseon-guksa in the first year of the reign of Silla Kingdom‚Äôs King Aejang (800). However, the temple‚Äôs founding year preceded the monk‚Äôs year of birth so there seems to have been a mistake in the year of foundation. Daeungjeon, the main hall, has three rooms in the front and two on the sides with a gambrel roof. Designated as Jeollanam-do Tangible Cultural Property, the structure features a modest and simple architecture that is estimated to date back to the latter half of the Joseon dynasty.","regDate":"2023-02-04","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollanam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Jeollanam-do/2023-02-04-1675506964115"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
