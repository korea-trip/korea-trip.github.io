In addition to the beautiful natural scenery, the main draw of this particular location is that there is no other place near Seoul as this forest where one can get an excellent view of the night sky. From Seoul, one might expect to see about three stars on a good day, while at the Jungmisan Observatory one can typically observe over 3,000 stars. \n<br><br>\nJungmisan Observatory provides an experiential learning center that offers astronomy programs for children, including preschoolers. Children can gain a deeper understanding of space and basic astronomy through various programs, such as stargazing. In addition to the astronomy programs, the observatory also offers forest bathing, forest ecology, and insect learning programs along with the nearby recreational forest.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-10-7244-3498|\n|parking:|Available|\n|useseason:|Varies by program|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Hiking Course:|Jungmisan Observatory ‚Üî Jungmisan Mountain summit (833 m) (Approx. 90 min / round trip)<br>Jungmisan Observatory ‚Üî Oksan Mountain (577 m) (Approx. 50 min / round trip)<br>Jungmisan Observatory ‚Üî Sogunisan Mountain (660 m) ‚Üî Yumyeongsan Mountain summit (862 m) (Approx. 3 hr / round trip)|\n|Available Facilities:|Forest ecology experience, outdoor observation, campsite, group accommodations |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-29-1661766067282/219614_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661766067282/219614_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-10-7244-3498](tel:+821072443498)\n- [üè†www.astrocafe.co.kr](http://www.astrocafe.co.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5817334239\nlongitude: 127.4594657131\ntitle: 1268, Jungmisan-ro, Yangpyeong-gun, Gyeonggi-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-29-1661766067282","title":"Jungmisan Observatory (Ï§ëÎØ∏ÏÇ∞ Ï≤úÎ¨∏ÎåÄ)","description":"Situated only 40 minute's drive from Seoul, the Jungmisan Observatory is nestled within Jungmisan Recreational Forest 437 kilometers above sea level.
