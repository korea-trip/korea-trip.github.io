The mountain was previously called Gwangaksan Mountain but was renamed during the Goryeo period by King Taejo. The mountain is located in Sanggwanggyo-dong, between the Gyeongbu expressway and the road that connects Seoul and Suwon. The mild and gentle ridge of the mountain makes it perfect for leisure walks. As one of the eight attractions of Suwon, the view of snow-covered trees is a must-see. Starting in 2003, the mountain closes to the public every three years to allow nature to heal in peace.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-31-228-4574|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restricted Mountain Areas :|[hiking.kworks.co.kr](http://hiking.kworks.co.kr/sub_map/map_user01.aspx)|\n|Hiking Course:|* Kyunggi University‚ÜíHyeongjaebong Peak‚ÜíSirubong Peak‚ÜíJijidae Cliff (10.2 km / 4 hr) <br>* Munamgol Cave‚ÜíBaeknyeon Mineral Spring‚ÜíHyeongjaebong Peak‚ÜíSirubong Peak (3.4 km / 2 hr) <br>* Yangji Farm‚ÜíTtokkijae Pass‚ÜíSirubong Peak‚ÜíTongsindae Cliff‚ÜíJijidae Cliff (6.4 km / 3 hr)|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-09-14-1663152340710/2667433_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-14-1663152340710/2667433_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-14-1663152340710/2667434_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-14-1663152340710/2667434_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-14-1663152340710/2667435_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-14-1663152340710/2667435_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-14-1663152340710/2667436_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-14-1663152340710/2667436_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-14-1663152340710/2667437_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-14-1663152340710/2667437_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-14-1663152340710/2667438_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-14-1663152340710/2667438_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-14-1663152340710/2667440_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-14-1663152340710/2667440_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-14-1663152340710/2667441_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-14-1663152340710/2667441_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-14-1663152340710/2667442_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-14-1663152340710/2667442_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-14-1663152340710/2667432_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-14-1663152340710/2667432_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-31-228-4574](tel:+82312284574)\n- [üè†www.suwon.go.kr](http://www.suwon.go.kr/web/visitsuwon/tour03/tour03-02/pages.do?seqNo=128)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.3294352295\nlongitude: 127.0169408703\ntitle: Sanggwanggyo-dong, Suwon-si, Gyeonggi-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-09-14-1663152340710","title":"Gwanggyosan Mountain (Í¥ëÍµêÏÇ∞)","description":"Gwanggyosan Mountain located north of Suwon protects the city from the cold wind blown from the north.
