It spans over 1,635m in length, 2m in x_width, and 2m in x_height and is located 52km from Seoul. It is estimated that approximately 30,000 soldiers could move through the tunnel per hour. The scale is similar to the 2nd Tunnel, but it was thought to be more threatening as an invasion tool than the 1st and 2nd Tunnels. Located only 4km away from Imjingak toward the southwest and 3.5km from the Tongilchon area, it is accessible by car in approximately 45 min from Seoul.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-31-940-8526,<br>+82-31-954-0303|\n|parking:|[Imjingak Parking Lot]<br>Compact car 1,000 / Small-sized car 2,000 won / Mid-sized car 3,000 won / Large-sized car 5,000 won|\n|restdate:|Mondays & Public holidays (Excluding weekends, Seollal/Chuseok)|\n|usetime:|Weekdays 09:20-15:00 / Weekends 09:20-15:30|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Tour Course Information:|The 3rd Tunnel (DMZ video room) ‚Üí Dora Observatory ‚Üí Dorasan Station ‚Üí Tongilchon<br> * Tour course subject to change.|\n|Available Facilities:|Tongilchon local produce, convenience store|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-09-09-1662709464827/2617823_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-09-1662709464827/2617823_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-09-1662709464827/2617824_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-09-1662709464827/2617824_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-31-940-8526](tel:+82319408526)\n- [üè†www.dmz.go.kr](http://www.dmz.go.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.9165529096\nlongitude: 126.6991949569\ntitle: Je3ttanggul-ro, Paju-si, Gyeonggi-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus] <br>\nFrom Seoul Station, take Bus No. 909 and get off at Munsan Jongjeom Bus Stop. <BR>Transfer to Bus No. 058 and get off at Imjingak Resort Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-09-09-1662709464827","title":"The 3rd Tunnel (Dorasan Observatory) (Ï†ú3ÎïÖÍµ¥)","description":"The 3rd Tunnel was discovered by South Korea in 1978.

A monument rests within the park that pays tribute to the 18 Korean and foreign war correspondents who died trying to share their, often tragic, stories of the war. They include Han Gyu-ho of the Seoul Shinmun as well as journalists from the U.S. (10 people), Britain (4 people), France (2 people) and the Philippines (1 person). There is also a tower built to commemorate the loyalty and courage of 10 brave soldiers who sacrificed themselves in a bomb attack, a memorial tower dedicated to anticommunist guerilla units from the Gaema Plateau, and a statue of Colonel Lee Yu-jung and Second Lieutenant Kim Man-sul.","regDate":"2022-09-16","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Parks"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-09-16-1663309753166"},{"id":"2022-09-16-1663304803597","title":"Paju Jangneung Royal Tomb [UNESCO World Heritage] (ÌååÏ£º Ïû•Î¶â(Ïù∏Ï°∞, Ïù∏Ïó¥ÏôïÌõÑ) [Ïú†ÎÑ§Ïä§ÏΩî ÏÑ∏Í≥ÑÎ¨∏ÌôîÏú†ÏÇ∞])","description":"Located in Paju, Jangneung is the tomb of King Injo (1595-1649, reign 1623-1649), the 16th ruler of the Joseon dynasty, and Queen Inyeol. <br><br>King Injo took the throne in 1623 after having overthrown the previous king, Gwanghaegun, in a military revolt.
