During the Silla Kingdom (about 1,300 years ago), the temple was named ‚ÄòBaegunsa‚Äô by King Munmu, in reference to the temple‚Äôs mountain home. During the Joseon dynasty, it was the temporary residence of Heungseon Daewongun (1820-1898, a politician and father of King Gojong), who stayed at the temple for 10 years praying for his son to ascend to the throne. When his son was finally crowned king, Heungseon Daewongun rebuilt the temple and changed the name to Yonggungsa.\n<br><br>\nThe temple consists of various buildings such as Gwaneumjeon (re-constructed by Heungseon Daewongun), Yosachae (home of the monks), Chilseonggak, and Yonghwanggak. In Yosachae, the writings of Heungseon Daewongun are hung on the wall and recently, an 11 meter-high statue of Maitreya was put in place. In front of the temple are two 1,300 year-old zelkova trees.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-32-746-1361|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Open 24 hr|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-11-1660239586709/1577735_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660239586709/1577735_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660239586709/1577736_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660239586709/1577736_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660239586709/1577737_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660239586709/1577737_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660239586709/1577740_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660239586709/1577740_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660239586709/1577741_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660239586709/1577741_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-32-746-1361](tel:+82327461361)\n- [üè†itour.incheon.go.kr](http://itour.incheon.go.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.4971570919\nlongitude: 126.5279807341\ntitle: 199-1, Unnam-ro, Jung-gu, Incheon\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-11-1660239586709","title":"Incheon Yonggungsa Temple (Ïö©Í∂ÅÏÇ¨ (Ïù∏Ï≤ú))","description":"Yonggungsa Temple is located in the same region as the Incheon International Airport and sits on the northeastern slopes of Baegunsan Mountain.
