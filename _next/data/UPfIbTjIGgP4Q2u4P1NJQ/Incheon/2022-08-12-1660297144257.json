The clean, sandy beach stretches out beautifully against the backdrop of a lush pine tree forest so dense that it does not let daylight in, even at midday. Facing the beach is Silmido Island, the location for the filming of Silmido (2003), a Korean movie based on the tragic story of Korean Special Ops Unit 684. The film set, however, was demolished after the shooting. The pathway to the island, which has no residents, can be shown during low tide. Therefore, visitors should be aware of the tidal times to know when they can cross back to the mainland.","regDate":"2022-08-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-12-1660280190872/190690_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-08-12-1660280190872","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Incheon/2022-08-12-1660280190872"},{"id":"2022-08-12-1660277185177","title":"Seonnyeo Rock (ÏÑ†ÎÖÄÎ∞îÏúÑ)","description":"Seonnyeo Rock is located near the Seoul metropolitan area, in the northern part of Yongyudo Island, past Masian Beach.

Artists come to recreate the scenery of the sharp rock against the ocean on their canvas as they listen to the waves crash. The beach is also popular among tourists at sunset, when the fading sun colors the sea around the rock.<br> On the other side is a small dock and old fishing boats. This beach is less crowded than Wangsan Beach or those in Eurwang-ri, making it the perfect spot for swimming and camping. <br> There is a pretty cafe up the hill from the rock and it is a great place for enjoying the ocean scenery with a cup of tea. On the other side of the cafe is a garden with pine trees, yet another beautiful spot to watch the sunset.","regDate":"2022-08-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Nature","Natural Resources","Rocks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-12-1660277185177/1826990_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-08-12-1660277185177","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Incheon/2022-08-12-1660277185177"},{"id":"2022-08-12-1660271887021","title":"Seongmodo Island (ÏÑùÎ™®ÎèÑ)","description":"Seongmodo Island, located 1.2 kilometers west of Ganghwado Island, is a popular destination for families and those looking for relaxation.
