The first section is the Namsan Area, a treasure trove of Buddhist art masterpieces dating back to the Silla Kingdom. Gyeongju Namsan Mountain (often referred to as an ‚Äòoutdoor museum‚Äô) is home to many historical heritage sites from the Silla Kingdom. Major attractions include  Poseokjeong (Historic Site No.1), Tapgok Maaejosanggun (Treasure No. 201), Cheollyongsaji Three-story Stone Pagoda (Treasure No. 1188), Chilbulam Maae Stone Buddha (Treasure No. 200), Bulgok Seated Stone Buddha (Treasure No. 198), and 37 other Buddhist relics<br><br>The second section is the Wolseong Area, one of the former palace sites of the Silla Kingdom.

Lastly, is the Sanseong Area, housing remnants of the major defense system for the capital city.
