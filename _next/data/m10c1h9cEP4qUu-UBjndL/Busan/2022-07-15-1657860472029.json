Originally a protected area, entrance was not permitted until its opening to the public in 1996, when visitors could first experience the untouched landscape. Now, visitors can fish, explore the observatory, and enjoy the walking path and the elevated bridge. The abundunt pine trees along the walking path make for a pleasant stroll while the path up to the observatory offers great views. If it is fishing that you want, here you can fish on the ocean as well as off the fantastically shaped rocks.  There is also a famous road to go for a drive, leading from Songdo Beach to Amnam Park. This drive takes approximately 5 minutes, but it takes about 20 minutes on foot.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-51-240-4538|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Available Facilities:|Sculptures, square, octagonal pavilion, fishing area, observatory, sports facilities (tennis, gateball, inline skating), drinking fountain, etc.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-15-1657860472029/1572116_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-15-1657860472029/1572116_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-15-1657860472029/1572117_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-15-1657860472029/1572117_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-15-1657860472029/1572118_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-15-1657860472029/1572118_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-15-1657860472029/1572119_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-15-1657860472029/1572119_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-15-1657860472029/1572120_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-15-1657860472029/1572120_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-15-1657860472029/1572122_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-15-1657860472029/1572122_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-15-1657860472029/1572123_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-15-1657860472029/1572123_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-15-1657860472029/1572124_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-15-1657860472029/1572124_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-15-1657860472029/1572125_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-15-1657860472029/1572125_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-15-1657860472029/1572129_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-15-1657860472029/1572129_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-51-240-4538](tel:+82512404538)\n- [üè†culture.bsseogu.go.kr](http://culture.bsseogu.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.0616492424\nlongitude: 129.0151037432\ntitle: 185, Amnamgongwon-ro, Seo-gu, Busan\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway + Bus]<br>\nJagalchi Station (Busan Subway Line 1), Exit 2.<br>Turn left at the corner, and cross the road,  go for 70m to arrive at the bus stop.<br>Take Bus No. 7, 9 or 71, and get off at Amnam Park Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-15-1657860472029","title":"Amnam Park (Î∂ÄÏÇ∞ ÏïîÎÇ®Í≥µÏõê)","description":"The magnificent cliffs and tree-lined seaside views of Amnam Park bring the harmony of the bluish-green waters and the forested landscape together.

It was built after the Imjin War (1592-1598) to prepare for any further invasions. It was first built with stones and was renovated in 1707.  During the Japanese Colonization, it was severely damaged.

Built in December, 1909 at the end of the Daehan Empire (1897-1910), it is an intricate building that houses a light tower (9.2 meters high), an office, and a lighthouse keeper‚Äôs room. Plum blossoms, the symbol of the imperial family of Joseon, are delicately carved along this European-style building. It is considered a remarkable cultural property not only because of its architectural design, unique shape or historic value, but also because it has been surprisingly well-maintained, especially in comparison to other lighthouses built during the same period. In recognition of its unmatched style and preservation, the old Gadeokdo lighthouse was designated Tangible Cultural Property No. 50 of Busan in Sep. 2003. It is owned and managed by the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries. A new lighthouse was built next to the original one in 2002. The new lighthouse structure is octagonal in shape and 40.5 meters high, the second highest lighthouse in Korea. <br><br>Gadeokdo Island, the location of Gadeokdo lighthouse, is often referred to as the ‚ÄòIsland of History,‚Äô and is the largest island in Busan. Gadeokdo, a strategically important base for military operations and seaborne trade, was the stage for a number of gruesome battles during the Imjin War (1592-1598). Today, it is a critical entry point to the Jinhae Bay. <br><br>Gadeokdo Lighthouse is located within a national naval base. Therefore, visitors must contact and register with the Busan Regional Maritime Affairs and Port Office prior to visiting the lighthouse. Those who participate in the Lighthouse Experience Program (parties of 6 or less) can spend the night in the innkeeper‚Äôs room free of charge. In order to use these accommodations, visitors must apply online at the Busan Regional Maritime Affairs and Port‚Äôs homepage between the 1st and the 8th of the month, one month prior to the desired date of visit.","regDate":"2022-08-17","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Busan","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-17-1660711773645/1982388_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Busan/2022-08-17-1660711773645"},{"id":"2022-08-17-1660705367268","title":"Eulsukdo Migratory Bird Park (ÏùÑÏàôÎèÑ Ï≤†ÏÉàÍ≥µÏõê)","description":"Eulsukdo Migratory Bird Park, designated as Natural Monument No. 179, is located in the lower part of Elsukdo Island.
