Those who were displaced by the war gathered around the area and made makeshift housing out of sticks and tarps. The place also functioned as a marketplace where residents traded aid goods that were delivered at the nearby port. It was a place to meet family members separated during the war and a place that has since then come to symbolize the sorrow and grief of those living during the Korean War. The place has the deepest significance for the over 100,000 people that were displaced during the war and were subsequently scattered throughout Yeongju-dong Hill, Donggwang-dong and Bosu-dong.<br> <br><b>* Railway </b><br>In memory of the Busan Train Station (now the location of the Jungang-dong Trade Center), a 140m-street was created in front of the 40-step Stairway, together with the 40-step Square and Railroad Crossing Plaza.<br><br><b>* Seaway</b> <br>In commemoration of the Busan Port, under the theme of a 'seaway,' a 120m-street has been created in front of Sora Stairway, together with the Sora Stair Square and Pier Plaza. <br><br><b>* Others (The Gate of Peace)<br></b>The Gate of Peace is located near the entrance of Railway.

Built in December, 1909 at the end of the Daehan Empire (1897-1910), it is an intricate building that houses a light tower (9.2 meters high), an office, and a lighthouse keeper‚Äôs room. Plum blossoms, the symbol of the imperial family of Joseon, are delicately carved along this European-style building. It is considered a remarkable cultural property not only because of its architectural design, unique shape or historic value, but also because it has been surprisingly well-maintained, especially in comparison to other lighthouses built during the same period. In recognition of its unmatched style and preservation, the old Gadeokdo lighthouse was designated Tangible Cultural Property No. 50 of Busan in Sep. 2003. It is owned and managed by the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries. A new lighthouse was built next to the original one in 2002. The new lighthouse structure is octagonal in shape and 40.5 meters high, the second highest lighthouse in Korea. <br><br>Gadeokdo Island, the location of Gadeokdo lighthouse, is often referred to as the ‚ÄòIsland of History,‚Äô and is the largest island in Busan. Gadeokdo, a strategically important base for military operations and seaborne trade, was the stage for a number of gruesome battles during the Imjin War (1592-1598). Today, it is a critical entry point to the Jinhae Bay. <br><br>Gadeokdo Lighthouse is located within a national naval base. Therefore, visitors must contact and register with the Busan Regional Maritime Affairs and Port Office prior to visiting the lighthouse. Those who participate in the Lighthouse Experience Program (parties of 6 or less) can spend the night in the innkeeper‚Äôs room free of charge. In order to use these accommodations, visitors must apply online at the Busan Regional Maritime Affairs and Port‚Äôs homepage between the 1st and the 8th of the month, one month prior to the desired date of visit.","regDate":"2022-08-17","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Busan","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-17-1660711773645/1982388_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Busan/2022-08-17-1660711773645"},{"id":"2022-08-17-1660705367268","title":"Eulsukdo Migratory Bird Park (ÏùÑÏàôÎèÑ Ï≤†ÏÉàÍ≥µÏõê)","description":"Eulsukdo Migratory Bird Park, designated as Natural Monument No. 179, is located in the lower part of Elsukdo Island.
