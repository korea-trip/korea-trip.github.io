The original buildings of the government complex were all burned to the ground in 1434 and rebuilt shortly afterward, with continual work done throughout the Joseon period. However, it was systemically destroyed during the Japanese colonial period (1910-1945) with the exception of Gwandeokjeong Pavilion, which remained intact. The current Jeju-mok Government Office was restored in December 2002 following four extensive excavation projects from 1991 to 1998, which were performed to to find its structures as well as locations of buildings, based on expert opinions as well as old documents.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-64-710-6714|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 1,500 won / Teenagers 800 won / Children 400 won<br />Groups - Adults 1,000 won / Teenagers 600 won / Children 300 won<br /><br>* Groups: 10 people or more<br />* Free admission: Preschoolers (ages 6 and younger), senior citizens (ages 65 and older)|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-02-09-1675928154670/2517308_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-09-1675928154670/2517308_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-09-1675928154670/2517372_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-09-1675928154670/2517372_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-09-1675928154670/2517377_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-09-1675928154670/2517377_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-09-1675928154670/2517378_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-09-1675928154670/2517378_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-09-1675928154670/2517380_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-09-1675928154670/2517380_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-09-1675928154670/2517381_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-09-1675928154670/2517381_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-09-1675928154670/2517382_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-09-1675928154670/2517382_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-09-1675928154670/2517385_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-09-1675928154670/2517385_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-09-1675928154670/2517391_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-09-1675928154670/2517391_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-09-1675928154670/2517304_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-09-1675928154670/2517304_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-64-710-6714](tel:+82647106714)\n- [🏠www.cha.go.kr](http://www.cha.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.5137037819\nlongitude: 126.5220646195\ntitle: 25, Gwandeok-ro, Jeju-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nTake Bus No. 100, 200, or 300 and get off at Gwandeokjeong Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2023-02-09-1675928154670","title":"Jeju-mok Government Office (제주목관아)","description":"Jeju-mok Government Office is the former central government office where the magistrate of Jeju presided over political and administrative affairs from the Tamna period until the Joseon dynasty.
