The trees measure 7-14 meters in x_height and 50-110 centimeters in diameter, with canopy spread of 10-15 meters. In the past, the trees were harvested for pine nuts, as well as used for the construction of quality furniture and baduk game boards.<br><br>\n\nIn addition to the large colony of nutmeg yew, the forest is also home to many rare orchid species. The trees emit a lot of phytoncide, which is said to strengthen the immune system and boost the natural healing ability of the human body. Nearby attractions include volcanic cones like Abuoreum and Yongnunioruem, perfect for a more energetic walk and a view of Bijarim Forest from above.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-64-710-7911|\n|parking:|Available (110 spaces)|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00 <br>* Last admission 1 hour before closing|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 3,000 won / Teenagers & Children 1,500 won<br>Groups - Adults 1,500 won / Teenagers & Children 1,000 won|\n|Available Facilities:|Restaurant, store|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-19-1658210099379/2668267_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658210099379/2668267_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658210099379/2668268_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658210099379/2668268_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658210099379/2668269_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658210099379/2668269_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658210099379/2668270_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658210099379/2668270_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658210099379/2668271_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658210099379/2668271_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-64-710-7911](tel:+82647107911)\n- [🏠www.visitjeju.net](http://www.visitjeju.net/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.4862530625\nlongitude: 126.8074904603\ntitle: 55, Bijasup-gil, Jeju-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-19-1658210099379","title":"Bijarim Forest (비자림)","description":"Designated Natural Monument No. 374, Bijarim Forest is a group of about 2,800 nutmeg yew trees between 500 and 800 years old.

Soesokkak Estuary is lined with cliffs of curious lava formations, which are overhung with pine trees. <br>It was chosen as one of hidden picturesque scenery in Chilsip-ri, Seogwi-po, comprised of deep blue ocean, uniquely-shaped rocks formed by lava and a pine forest.<br>Soesokkak Estuary is located in Hahyo-dong on the southern side of Hallasan Mountain. The area is also well-known for its tangerines, and visitors are drawn to the area by the fresh citrus scent.

Bordered by waters that are only an average of one meter deep, the beach gently slopes at a five degree angle.

A large crater, formed by the hot lava mixing with cold ocean water, is located at the top of Seongsan Ilchulbong Tuff Cone. The crater is about 600 meters in diameter and 90 meters deep. It has been featured in films, and was originally used for agriculture, but has now been given over to a field of silver grass.
