Soesokkak Estuary is lined with cliffs of curious lava formations, which are overhung with pine trees. <br>It was chosen as one of hidden picturesque scenery in Chilsip-ri, Seogwi-po, comprised of deep blue ocean, uniquely-shaped rocks formed by lava and a pine forest.<br>Soesokkak Estuary is located in Hahyo-dong on the southern side of Hallasan Mountain. The area is also well-known for its tangerines, and visitors are drawn to the area by the fresh citrus scent.

Bordered by waters that are only an average of one meter deep, the beach gently slopes at a five degree angle.
