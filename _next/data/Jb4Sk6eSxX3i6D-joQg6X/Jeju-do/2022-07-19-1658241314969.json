{"pageProps":{"content":"![Daheeyeon Garden (Îã§Ìù¨Ïó∞)](/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620108_image2_1.webp)\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> Daheeyeon Garden is a major tea farm on Jeju Island, which has the best conditions for growing great tea in a natural environment. Jeju has a year-round average temerature of 16‚ÑÉ and nutrient-rich soil with plenty of water for the tea plants to grow well. The two cave cafes, Evergreen Luce Garden and Eve Hall, serve naturally fermented green tea bread, cookies, muffins, green tea latte and green tea juice. <br><br>\n\nEvergreen Luce outdoor garden was built inside a cave formed naturally by a volcanic eruption. Despite being in a cave, this outdoor garden has ponds, bridges, indigenous trees and flowers. Eve Hall is located through a hole in the cave ceiling and can be only reached after passing through a tunnel-like cave. The deepest part of Eve Hall is roughly 30 meters and is home to bats; if you are lucky, you might even see a few.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-64-782-0005,<br> +82-64-784-9030|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|* Varies by season; please make an inquiry in advance.|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|* Varies by season; please make an inquiry in advance.|\n|Available Facilities:|Tea culture center, Daheeyeon restaurant, Gotjawal Cave, Cave Cafe, green tea field, Bille Pond, zipline, etc. |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Reservation Info. for Natives:|Advanced reservation required for experience programs.|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620105_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620105_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620106_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620106_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620107_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620107_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620109_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620109_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620110_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620110_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620111_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620111_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620112_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620112_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620113_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620113_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620114_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620114_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620115_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620115_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-64-782-0005](tel:+82647820005)\n- [üè†www.daheeyeon.com](http://www.daheeyeon.com/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.4871596654\nlongitude: 126.7061797858\ntitle: 117, Seongyo-ro, Jeju-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Local Bus]<br>\nFrom Jeju International Airport, take Bus No. 38 and get off at Jocheon-eup Gwannae/Seonin-dong Bus Stop.<br>\nTransfer to Bus No. 900 and get off at Gyeongdeokwon Bus Stop.<br><br>\n\n[Taxi]<br>\nApprox. 40 min from Jeju International Airport.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-19-1658241314969","title":"Daheeyeon Garden (Îã§Ìù¨Ïó∞)","description":"Daheeyeon Garden is a major tea farm on Jeju Island, which has the best conditions for growing great tea in a natural environment.

The cliffs on the southern side of the lava dome are marked with a rich variety of curious formations such as weathering pits and talus scree slopes, some of which are as high as 200 meters. As its name ‚Äòsanbang‚Äô ‚Äì literally meaning ‚Äòa cave inside a mountain‚Äô ‚Äì suggests, this mountain contains a cave, which is located about 150 meters above sea level and has a spectacular view out over the ocean. Due to its close location to the sea and its high elevation, the peak is often ringed with clouds. The upper slopes of the mountain have their own distinct climatic conditions and are protected for their value for botanical research. <br><br>The Sanbangsa Temple and  Bomunsa Temple, which holds the relics of Buddha, are both located on the mountain. Walk along the stone-steps between the two temples and you will find the Sanbanggulsa Grotto. A signal beacon called ‚ÄòYeondae‚Äô in Korean stands at the roadside in front of the mountain, which, in the past, used to fire and smoke to relay urgent messages. Regarding function, it is similar to the more well-known ‚ÄòBongsudae‚Äô signal beacons; but ‚ÄòYeondae‚Äô beacons were built around hilly or coastal areas while ‚ÄòBongsudae‚Äô beacons were built on mountain tops. During the daytime, smoke was used to send warning signals, while fire was used at night. <br><br>*x_height above sea level  395.2m/ x_height above ground-level  345m/ Circumference  3,780m / Area  988,332„é°/ Diameter 1,314m","regDate":"2023-02-11","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-11-1676090352667/2648186_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-11-1676090352667"},{"id":"2023-02-11-1676086600762","title":"Sanbanggulsa Grotto - Jeju (ÏÇ∞Î∞©Íµ¥ÏÇ¨(Ï†úÏ£º))","description":"It is said that the peak of Hallasan Mountain where Baekrokho Lake now exists was taken off and thrown away, which then became Sanbangsan Mountain.
