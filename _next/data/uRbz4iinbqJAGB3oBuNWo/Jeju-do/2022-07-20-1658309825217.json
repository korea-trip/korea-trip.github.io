The length of the island is 3.8 kilometers and the circumference is 17 kilometers. People have lived in Udo Island since the Joseon period, with most living as a farmer or working in the fishing industry. The island boasts fertile soil, abundant schools of fish, and scenic sights; local heritages (female divers, stone walls, and stone tombs) as well as natural attractions abound on the island, making it a miniature of Jeju Island. The island is also full of amenities and tourism outlets  fishing, bike trails, sand massages, submarine tours and cruises. At the highest point of the island, Udobong Peak (alt. 132 meters), visitors can see a panoramic view of the island as well as Seongsan Ilchulbong Tuff Cone and the main island. Rhodolith Beach (a white beach designated Natural Monument) has appeared regularly in films and TV commercials thanks to its breathtaking white sand and emerald sea. The sea around the beach showcases different colors depending on the water level. This makes Rhodolith Beach one of the most popular tourist attractions in Jeju-do, along with Hallasan Mountain. To protect the exquisite nature and promote maritime tourism, Bukjeju County designated two ports on the island (Udo Port and Haumokdong Port) and the sea surrounding it (25,863 ㎢) as Udo Maritime Park in January 2001. Visitors can appreciate maritime tourism at its best including a trip under the sea by submarine.","regDate":"2023-02-14","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-14-1676349661718/2654827_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-14-1676349661718"},{"id":"2023-02-14-1676345929345","title":"Suwolbong Tuff Cone and Chagwi Coast (수월봉과 차귀해안)","description":"Located at the western end of Jeju Island, Suwolbong Tuff Cone, a small mountain, is famous for being a favorite sunset viewing place.

The history of the garden started in 1963 when Seong Beom-yeong, the founder of the garden, came to Jeju and cultivated the wasteland full of rocks. The garden came into the international spotlight as the beautiful space was created from the wastelands by a single farmer. The garden has been visited by many honored public figures such as Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao from China, Nakasone from Japan, Kim Yongsun from North Korea and others. Currently, about 400 planted trees are on display.
