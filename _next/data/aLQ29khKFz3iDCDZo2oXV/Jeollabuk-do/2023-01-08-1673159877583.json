The walls started out using mud and natural stones, but later changed to more square-shaped stones held together with cement and topped with Korean roofing tiles. The wall blends in harmony with the traditional houses of the village and the slowly flowing Namdaecheon Stream.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-1899-8687,<BR>+82-63-320-2542|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Open 24 hr|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-08-1673159877583/711920_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-08-1673159877583/711920_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-08-1673159877583/711932_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-08-1673159877583/711932_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-08-1673159877583/1247081_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-08-1673159877583/1247081_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-08-1673159877583/1247086_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-08-1673159877583/1247086_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-08-1673159877583/1247123_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-08-1673159877583/1247123_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-08-1673159877583/2366386_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-08-1673159877583/2366386_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-08-1673159877583/2366387_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-08-1673159877583/2366387_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-08-1673159877583/2366388_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-08-1673159877583/2366388_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-08-1673159877583/2366390_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-08-1673159877583/2366390_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-08-1673159877583/711913_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-08-1673159877583/711913_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-1899-8687](tel:+8218998687)\n- [🏠 tour.muju.go.kr</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.cha.go.kr/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"new window popup\" class=\"web\">www.cha.go.kr](http://tour.muju.go.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.0271450456\nlongitude: 127.7455474342\ntitle: 13, Gilbonji-gil, Muju-gun, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-08-1673159877583","title":"Old Walls of Jijeon Village in Muju (무주 지전마을 옛 담장)","description":"The Old Walls of Jijeon Village in Muju were mostly all built to mark the dividing line between houses, rather than to keep people out.

The sprawling fields of reeds along the East Ridge are also a major draw, undulating like waves of gold in the crisp autumn wind.
