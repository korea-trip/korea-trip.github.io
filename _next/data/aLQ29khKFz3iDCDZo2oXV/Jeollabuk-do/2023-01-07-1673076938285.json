The temple is said to have been built by the Buddhist monk Yeongeunjosa in the year 636 of the Baekje dynasty. Once a large temple with over fifty buildings, Naejangsa was completely destroyed throughout the course of Jeongyujaeran (second Japanese invasion in 1597) and the Korean War (1950-1953). The present temple is largely the result of reconstruction efforts completed in the 1970s. One of the most prized treasures at the temple is the Ijo-dongjong Bell, considered a major cultural asset. <br><br>Naejangsan Temple is a representative temple of Jeollabuk-do along with Geumsansa Temple on Moaksan Mountain. Surrounded on all sides by towering peaks, Naejangsa Temple boasts a picturesque landscape that is particularly striking in the fall when the mountains turn crimson with autumn leaves. Nearby attractions include Baegyangsa Temple, Bangjangsan Mountain, Jangseongho Lake, and Damyangho Lake.","regDate":"2023-01-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-13-1673595385332/1606435_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-13-1673595385332"},{"id":"2023-01-13-1673592009100","title":"Jangansan County Park (Ïû•ÏïàÏÇ∞Íµ∞Î¶ΩÍ≥µÏõê)","description":"Situated in Jangsu-gun in Jeollabuk-do, Jangansan Mountain (alt. 1,237 m) was officially designated a county park in 1986.

The sprawling fields of reeds along the East Ridge are also a major draw, undulating like waves of gold in the crisp autumn wind. In particular, the east hiking path on Jangansan Mountain is lined with a wide field of silver grass making it popular among hikers.","regDate":"2023-01-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Nature","Natural Sites","County Parks"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-13-1673592009100"},{"id":"2023-01-13-1673588176159","title":"Jaman Mural Village (ÏûêÎßåÎ≤ΩÌôîÎßàÏùÑ)","description":"Jaman Mural Village is located in the ridge between Omokdae and Imokdae along the foot of Seungamsan Mountain‚Äôs Jungbawi Rock.

The temple was burnt down during the Imjin War (1592-1598), leaving only Bogwangjeon Hall.
