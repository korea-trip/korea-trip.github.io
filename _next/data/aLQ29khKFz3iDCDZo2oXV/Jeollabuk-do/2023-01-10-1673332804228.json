The name Uniram refers to the steep walls of the valley where nothing but the sky, rocks, thick forests, and clouds can be seen. The valley is also befittingly named Baniram since it is so deep that it only receives direct sunlight for half the day. There are many strangely-shaped rocks like Jjokduri Rock, Cheollyeop Rock, and Daebul Rock scattered throughout the lush valley. At the peak of summer, the area is crowded with vacationers and is also popular for its autumn leaves.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-63-430-8382|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Hiking Course:|1.

The present temple is largely the result of reconstruction efforts completed in the 1970s. One of the most prized treasures at the temple is the Ijo-dongjong Bell, considered a major cultural asset. <br><br>Naejangsan Temple is a representative temple of Jeollabuk-do along with Geumsansa Temple on Moaksan Mountain.

The sprawling fields of reeds along the East Ridge are also a major draw, undulating like waves of gold in the crisp autumn wind. In particular, the east hiking path on Jangansan Mountain is lined with a wide field of silver grass making it popular among hikers.","regDate":"2023-01-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Nature","Natural Sites","County Parks"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-13-1673592009100"},{"id":"2023-01-13-1673588176159","title":"Jaman Mural Village (ÏûêÎßåÎ≤ΩÌôîÎßàÏùÑ)","description":"Jaman Mural Village is located in the ridge between Omokdae and Imokdae along the foot of Seungamsan Mountain‚Äôs Jungbawi Rock.

The temple was burnt down during the Imjin War (1592-1598), leaving only Bogwangjeon Hall.
