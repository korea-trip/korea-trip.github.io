Under King Mun's command, temples for the new fortress were built on east and west sides of the valley; the western temple was called Gaeam.

A stone sculpture and a statue of Granny Samsin (a goddess that looks after babies’ births and keeps them healthy) also stand at the temple. However, the temple’s most treasured assets are its two Natural Monuments  Emerald Gaiety (a climbing vine, Natural Monument No. 380) and the Cheongsil Pear Tree (Natural Monument No. 386). Reverse icicles, though found all over the mountainsides, are most readily and abundantly found in the Eunsusa Temple area.","regDate":"2022-07-31","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-31-1659303488502/1605752_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2022-07-31-1659303488502"},{"id":"2022-07-31-1659299982539","title":"Eunpa Lake Park (Eunpa Recreation Area) (은파호수공원(은파국민관광지))","description":"Located in Gunsan, Jeollabuk-do, Eunpa Lake Park was once a reservoir built before the Joseon dynasty that supplied water to nearby farms. The lake and its surrounding mountains were designated a national tourist site in 1985, but remain historically significant as they are featured on Daedongyeojido (Grand Map of Korea), a revered document developed by geographer Kim Jeong-ho. Known for its beauty at night, the lake was befittingly dubbed “Eunpa,” which means “silvery moonlit waves.”<br><br>Eupa Lake Park is full of natural beauty. The road that runs up from the park entrance is lined with cherry trees that create a breathtaking tunnel of pink flowers each spring. This stunning cherry blossom tunnel draws crowds of families and couples each year, particularly on the weekends. Mulbit Bridge, a landmark of the Eunpa tourist site, offers an impressive view of the Music Fountain and nightscape. At the park, you’ll also find an inline skating area, a waterfront stage, and a lotus flower garden.","regDate":"2022-07-31","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Resorts"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-31-1659299982539/2017305_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2022-07-31-1659299982539"},{"id":"2022-07-31-1659293025554","title":"Dongnagwon House (동락원)","description":"The Dongnagwon House in Jeonju Hanok Village provides a getaway to experience hanok stay and traditional Korean life.

Dongnagwon is a reproduction of the old hanok houses in Jeonju from the time when W. M. Junkin was doing his missionary work in the area. It is comprised of three buildings  Anchae (main hall), Sarangchae (guest house), and Haengnangchae (servants’ quarters).<br><br>Visitors to Dongnagwon can learn and experience traditional Korean culture such as music, crafts, and dance while inhabiting traditional lodging. In addition to providing accommodation for individual guests, Dongnagwon is also used for group accommodations or activities such as seminars, conferences, and family events.

Officially designated a city park in April 1978, it is centered around a natural pond, which dates back to the Goryeo dynasty (918-1392). The park is such a landmark of the area that the lotus flowers blooming in the park’s large pond are considered one of the most impressive attractions of Jeonju. The park spans an area of 13,000 ㎡ with the pond covering about two thirds of the southern sector. An arch-shaped suspension bridge stretches across the middle of the pond, offering up-close views of the lotus blossoms. <br><br>Park designers created a traditional pavilion and a water iris garden in honor of the park’s historical background and added an artificial waterfall and wooden bridge for visual effect. The park also houses nine stone monuments including the Children’s Charter, engravings of Shin Seok-jeong and Kim Hae-gang’s poetry, and a statue of General Jeon Bong-jun. <br><br>The park is the site of the annual Dano Changpomul (Water Iris) Festival, a much-anticipated event held on the day of Dano (a Korean traditional holiday that falls on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month). During the celebration, women wash their hair in iris-infused water from the pond to wish for good health in the coming year.","regDate":"2022-07-31","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-31-1659289135246/2366393_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2022-07-31-1659289135246","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Jeollabuk-do/2022-07-31-1659289135246"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
