Under King Mun's command, temples for the new fortress were built on east and west sides of the valley; the western temple was called Gaeam.

A stone sculpture and a statue of Granny Samsin (a goddess that looks after babies’ births and keeps them healthy) also stand at the temple. However, the temple’s most treasured assets are its two Natural Monuments  Emerald Gaiety (a climbing vine, Natural Monument No. 380) and the Cheongsil Pear Tree (Natural Monument No. 386). Reverse icicles, though found all over the mountainsides, are most readily and abundantly found in the Eunsusa Temple area.","regDate":"2022-07-31","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-31-1659303488502/1605752_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2022-07-31-1659303488502"},{"id":"2022-07-31-1659299982539","title":"Eunpa Lake Park (Eunpa Recreation Area) (은파호수공원(은파국민관광지))","description":"Located in Gunsan, Jeollabuk-do, Eunpa Lake Park was once a reservoir built before the Joseon dynasty that supplied water to nearby farms. The lake and its surrounding mountains were designated a national tourist site in 1985, but remain historically significant as they are featured on Daedongyeojido (Grand Map of Korea), a revered document developed by geographer Kim Jeong-ho. Known for its beauty at night, the lake was befittingly dubbed “Eunpa,” which means “silvery moonlit waves.”<br><br>Eupa Lake Park is full of natural beauty. The road that runs up from the park entrance is lined with cherry trees that create a breathtaking tunnel of pink flowers each spring. This stunning cherry blossom tunnel draws crowds of families and couples each year, particularly on the weekends. Mulbit Bridge, a landmark of the Eunpa tourist site, offers an impressive view of the Music Fountain and nightscape. At the park, you’ll also find an inline skating area, a waterfront stage, and a lotus flower garden.","regDate":"2022-07-31","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Resorts"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-31-1659299982539/2017305_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2022-07-31-1659299982539"},{"id":"2022-07-31-1659296201995","title":"Eocheongdo Island (어청도)","description":"Eocheongdo Island is known for its clear waters.
