This village has five restored hanok (traditional Korean house) premises, a pavilion, traditional garden, performance art stage and a time capsule plaza, making it a perfect spot for both locals and tourists to take a leisure walk. Upon entering from the front gate, visitors will get a taste of Korea's traditional life while escaping from the bustling city life. The traditional garden with its pavilion and old houses creates a peaceful ambiance before the forested Namsan Mountain. A time capsule commemorating Seoul’s 600th anniversary was buried in 1994 at the highest point of the village and is scheduled to be reopened 400 years later in 2394. <br><br> The five hanok premises at Namsangol Hanok Village once belonged to aristocrats and government officials of the Joseon dynasty. Each house was originally located in different neighborhoods, but they were all moved to this area and restored to their original form. The houses were rebuilt using their original materials, except for one house, where the materials were too old and deteriorated to be reused. The premises were carefully restored and replicated according to their original form to depict the owners’ social class and personality. These buildings are now used as an exhibit to portray the living environment during the Joseon dynasty as well as a venue for educational and cultural programs for children and tourists.<br><br>Some of the noteworthy programs and activities to participate in include wearing hanbok, folding hanji (traditional Korean paper), writing in Korean, traditional tea ceremony, traditional etiquette school and herbal medicine experience. There are also taekwondo demonstrations and other various performances held around the village. Visitors can also try traditional games such as <em>yunnori</em> (traditional board game), or understand more about the area through a guided tour.","regDate":"2022-08-06","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Folk Villages"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-06-1659818310507/1946562_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-08-06-1659818310507"},{"id":"2022-08-06-1659814596495","title":"Namsan Seoul Tower Hanbok Culture Experience Center (남산서울타워 한복문화체험관)","description":"Namsan Seoul Tower Hanbok Culture Experience Center is located in the lobby level (B1) of Seoul's landmark Namsan Seoul Tower.
