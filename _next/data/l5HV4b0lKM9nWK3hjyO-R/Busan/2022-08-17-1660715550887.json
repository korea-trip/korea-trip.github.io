Visitors are also encouraged to stop by tourist sites such as Busan Folk Tradition Arts Center, Busan Marine Natural History Museum, and Busan Botanical Garden.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-51-860-7880|\n|parking:|Use a public parking lot nearby|\n|usetime:|[Geumgang Rope Way (Cable Car)] 09:00-17:30<br>[Busan Marine Natural History Museum] 09:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Available Facilities:|[Recreational facilities]<br>‚Äì Geumgang Park Rope Way (cable car) <br>- Recreational facilities<br> <br>[Educational facilities]<br> - Busan Folk Art Museum<br> - Busan Marine Natural History Museum<br> - Geumgang Botanical Garden <br><br>[Facilities]<br>- Exercise equipment|\n|Parking Fees:|[First 10 min]<br>Large-sized cars 600 won / Mid-sized cars 400 won / Small-sized cars 200 won<br>[After 10 min] Charged for every additional 10 minutes<br>Large-sized cars 600 won / Mid-sized cars 400 won / Small-sied cars 200 won<br>[1-Day Parking (more than 4 hours)]<br>Small/Mid-sized cars 4,700 won / Large-sized cars depending on the size<br><br>* Mid-sized - 15~37 passengers / Large-sized - Bus|\n|Facility Utilization Fees:|[Cable Car Rope Way]<br> Adults & Teenagers - Round-trip 9,000 won / One-way 6,000 won <br> Children (age 4 to elementary school students) - Round-trip 6,000 won / One-way 4,000 won <br> Senior citizens (ages 65 & older) - Round-trip 7,000 won / One-way 5,000 won<br> <br> [Recreational Facilities]<br> Peter Pan - Adults & Teenagers 4,000 won  / Children 3,000 won<br> Viking - Adults & Teenagers 5,000 won  / Children 4,000 won<br> <br> [Geumgang Botanical Garden]<br> Individual - Adults 1,000 won  / Senior citizens & Teengers 800 won / Children 500 won <br> Group - Adults 800 won  / Senior citizens & Teengagers 500 won / Children 400 won|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-17-1660715550887/2641838_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-17-1660715550887/2641838_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-51-860-7880](tel:+82518607880)\n- [üè†geumgangpark.bisco.or.kr](http://geumgangpark.bisco.or.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.2190105271\nlongitude: 129.0762330134\ntitle: 155, Ujangchun-ro, Dongnae-gu, Busan\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-17-1660715550887","title":"Geumgang Park (Í∏àÍ∞ïÍ≥µÏõê)","description":"Located at the foot of Geumjeong Mountain (alt. 802 m), Geumgang Park stretches over a 3 million-square meter plot of land filled with lush forest and craggy cliffs and broken up by winding creeks.
