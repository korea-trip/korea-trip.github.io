It is said to have been built to appease the spirit of a young woman named Arang, who met an unfortunate death. <br><br>According to the legend, Arang was mistakenly killed by a low-ranking officer who had loved her and tried to hug her. After her death, she becomes a ghost and appears to every district magistrate (highest-ranking officer in a region) to appeal for the investigation of her unfair death, but each district magistrate dies of a heart attack. <br><br>Then, a new district magistrate by the name Lee is dispatched to the area. Unlike his predecessors, Lee listens to the story of the ghost and finds the low-ranked officer who had killed her and punishes him. He found Arang‚Äôs body and holded a religious ceremony on her behalf. Aranggak was also built in her memory. <br><br>Every year, an event called Arangje is held on April 16 by the lunar calendar in Aranggak Pavilion. Young maidens dressed in white hanbok perform a religious ceremony to soothe the sorrow of Arang. There is also a saying that the spirit of Arang will preserve the love of those couples who visit the pavilion together.","regDate":"2022-07-30","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-30-1659154895976/574085_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-07-30-1659154895976"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
