The name Bukchon, which literally translates to \"northern village,\" came about as the neighborhood lies north of two significant Seoul landmarks, Cheonggyecheon Stream and Jongno. Today, many of these hanoks operate as cultural centers, guesthouses, restaurants and tea houses, providing visitors with an opportunity to experience, learn and immerse themselves in traditional Korean culture. As Bukchon Hanok Village is an actual neighborhood with people's homes, visitors are advised to be respectful at all times while looking around.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-2-2148-4161|\n|parking:|Not available|\n|restdate:|Sundays|\n|usetime:|Weekdays & Saturdays 10:00-17:00<br>* Applies to 100-m long road along Bukchon-ro 11-gil|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Tour Course Information:|[dobo.visitseoul.net](http://english.visitseoul.net/walking-tour/BukchonHanokVillage_/622)|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Available Facilities:|Cafe, workshops, museum, etc.|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Jaedong Primary School Tourist Information Center:<br> +82-2-2148-4160 (English, Japanese)<br><br>Jeongdok Library Tourist Information Center: <br>+82-2-2148-4161 (English, Japanese, Chinese)|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-21-1658376681775/2363673_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658376681775/2363673_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658376681775/2363674_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658376681775/2363674_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-2-2148-4161](tel:+82221484161)\n- [üè†hanok.seoul.go.kr](http://hanok.seoul.go.kr/front/index.do)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5791612548\nlongitude: 126.9864254967\ntitle: 37, Gyedong-gil, Jongno-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway]<br>\nAnguk Station (Seoul Subway Line 3), Exit 1 or 2.<br> Go straight for approx. 300m to arrive at Bukchon Hanok Village.<br><br>\n\n[Bus]<br>\nTake Maeul Bus Jongno 02 and get off at Bukchon Hanok Village Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-21-1658376681775","title":"Bukchon Hanok Village (Î∂ÅÏ¥åÌïúÏò•ÎßàÏùÑ)","description":"Surrounded by Gyeongbokgung Palace, Changdeokgung Palace and Jongmyo Shrine, Bukchon Hanok Village is home to hundreds of traditional houses, called <em>hanok</em>, that date back to the Joseon dynasty.

The square, created based on the design of  traditional Korean <em>bojagi</em> (a colorful wrapping cloth), features the elegant beauty of traditional stonework that is colorful yet refined. The plaza also includes a model of Cheonggyecheon that provides visitors with a bird's-eye view of the restored Cheonggyecheon Stream. At the plaza, there are plaques that provide detailed commentaries on the 22 bridges that span the stream, as well as a number of graceful fountains that add to the ambience of the area. The area commemorates the Cheonggyecheon Stream Restoration Project, and also symbolizes gathering, harmony, peace, and unity.<br><br>After the completion of Cheonggye Plaza, Seoul Metropolitan Government designated the area as a vehicle-free zone on holidays, providing more leisure space for pedestrians. Since then, the waterfront areas of Cheonggyecheon Stream, and the surrounding streets have become popular places for those seeking refreshment and a variety of cultural experiences. A favorite of many is the Candle Fountain, which features the magnificent synchronicity of three different lighting fixtures and a four-meter-high, two-tiered waterfall. Along the two sides of the waterfall are the Palseokdam wishing wells, made of eight different stones from each of the nation's eight provinces.","regDate":"2022-07-21","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-21-1658418118385/2544890_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-07-21-1658418118385"},{"id":"2022-07-21-1658414103453","title":"Cheongdam Park (Ï≤≠Îã¥Í≥µÏõê)","description":"Up until the early 1960's, people would cross the Hangang River from Ttukseom Ferry Dock and arrive in Cheongdam-dong.
