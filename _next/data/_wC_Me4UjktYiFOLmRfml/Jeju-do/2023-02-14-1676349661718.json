The length of the island is 3.8 kilometers and the circumference is 17 kilometers. People have lived in Udo Island since the Joseon period, with most living as a farmer or working in the fishing industry. The island boasts fertile soil, abundant schools of fish, and scenic sights; local heritages (female divers, stone walls, and stone tombs) as well as natural attractions abound on the island, making it a miniature of Jeju Island. The island is also full of amenities and tourism outlets  fishing, bike trails, sand massages, submarine tours and cruises. At the highest point of the island, Udobong Peak (alt. 132 meters), visitors can see a panoramic view of the island as well as Seongsan Ilchulbong Tuff Cone and the main island. Rhodolith Beach (a white beach designated Natural Monument) has appeared regularly in films and TV commercials thanks to its breathtaking white sand and emerald sea. The sea around the beach showcases different colors depending on the water level. This makes Rhodolith Beach one of the most popular tourist attractions in Jeju-do, along with Hallasan Mountain. To protect the exquisite nature and promote maritime tourism, Bukjeju County designated two ports on the island (Udo Port and Haumokdong Port) and the sea surrounding it (25,863 ㎢) as Udo Maritime Park in January 2001. Visitors can appreciate maritime tourism at its best including a trip under the sea by submarine.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br> • Jeju Travel Hotline: +82-64-740-6000|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Film Locations:|Movie \"Little Mermaid (2004)\"|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-02-14-1676349661718/2364394_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-14-1676349661718/2364394_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-14-1676349661718/2364395_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-14-1676349661718/2364395_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-14-1676349661718/2364397_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-14-1676349661718/2364397_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-14-1676349661718/2364398_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-14-1676349661718/2364398_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-14-1676349661718/2364399_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-14-1676349661718/2364399_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-14-1676349661718/2654835_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-14-1676349661718/2654835_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-64-740-6000](tel:+82647406000)\n- [🏠https://www.visitjeju.net/kr/detail/view?contentsid=CONT_000000000500477\"title=\"새창: 비짓제주\"target=\"_blank\"><br>www.visitjeju.net](<br>https://www.visitjeju.net/kr/detail/view?contentsid=CONT_000000000500477)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.5065059625\nlongitude: 126.9533995648\ntitle: 153, Udo-ro, Jeju-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2023-02-14-1676349661718","title":"Udo Island - Udo Maritime Park (우도(해양도립공원))","description":"Situated 3.8 kilometers off the northeast coast of Jeju Island, Udo Island was named because it resembles a lying cow.

The name changed from Bunjae Arpia in 2007 to commemorate the 15th anniversary after opening and to renew the garden as an international garden. The history of the garden started in 1963 when Seong Beom-yeong, the founder of the garden, came to Jeju and cultivated the wasteland full of rocks. The garden came into the international spotlight as the beautiful space was created from the wastelands by a single farmer. The garden has been visited by many honored public figures such as Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao from China, Nakasone from Japan, Kim Yongsun from North Korea and others. Currently, about 400 planted trees are on display. Also, visitors can see various facilities including stone walls and stone towers stacked with Jeju volcanic stones, the largest artificial waterfall in Jeju, and a pond filled with large carp at the base of the the waterfall.","regDate":"2023-02-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Botanical Gardens"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-13-1676280988564/608548_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-13-1676280988564","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Jeju-do/2023-02-13-1676280988564"},{"id":"2023-02-13-1676277674763","title":"Songaksan Mountain (송악산)","description":"Songaksan Mountain is also called 99 Bong (99 Peaks) due to its 99 small peaks.
