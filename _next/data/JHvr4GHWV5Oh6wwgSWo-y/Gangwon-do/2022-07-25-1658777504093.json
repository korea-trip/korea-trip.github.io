There are many ranches in Pyeongchang, but Daegwallyeong Sheep Ranch is the only ranch that raises sheep. The sheep grazing field is surrounded by a 1.2 meter-long circular walkway, so visitors can view the sheep at all times during their visit. It takes about 40 minutes to walk along this path. A wooden shack located in the field appeared as a backdrop of the movie \"The Man from Mars.\"  The wooden shack fits perfectly with the sheep farm, and has become a popular photo site. To get a closer experience with the sheep, sign up for the feeding experience, where you can give hay to the sheep and even reach out to touch their fuzzy heads.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-33-335-1966|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|The day of Seollal (Lunar New Year's Day) & Chuseok (Korean Thanksgiving Day)<br>* May close in the case of adverse weather such as heavy snow, rain or thunderstorms; please call in advance.|\n|usetime:|November-February 09:00-17:00<br>March & October 09:00-17:30<br>April & September 09:00-18:00<br>May-August 09:00-18:30<br>* Last admission is 16:30.<br>* Hours are subject to change depending on weather or conditions on-site.|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Shopping Information:|Food & gifts available|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Admission Fees:|[Individuals]<br>Adults: 6,000 won / Children: 4,000 won / Senior citizens: 3,000 won<br><br>[Groups]<br>Adults: 5,000 won / Children: 3,500 won / Senior citizens: 3,000 won<br> <br>* Groups: 20 people or more<br>* Adults (ages 19-64), Children (ages 4-18), Senior citizens (ages 65 and older)<br>* Free admission: Preschoolers (ages 3 or under) / Free admission does not apply to groups of children<br>* Seniors citizens: ID required|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Sheep feeding area, royal azalea field, thached-roof house, marsh, walking trails, rest area, etc.|\n|Reservation Info. for Natives:|Reservations not accepted|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1583621_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1583621_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1583624_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1583624_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1583625_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1583625_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1583627_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1583627_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1890726_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1890726_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1890727_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1890727_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1890728_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1890728_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1890729_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1890729_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1890731_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1890731_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-33-335-1966](tel:+82333351966)\n- [üè†www.yangtte.co.kr]( http://www.yangtte.co.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.6876427505\nlongitude: 128.7533288363\ntitle: 483-32, Daegwallyeongmaru-gil, Pyeongchang-gun, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus + Taxi]<br>\nFrom Dong Seoul Bus Terminal, take an intercity bus to Hoenggye Intercity Bus Terminal.<br>From Hoenggye Bus Terminal, take a taxi to the ranch.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-25-1658777504093","title":"Daegwallyeong Sheep Ranch (ÎåÄÍ¥ÄÎ†π ÏñëÎñºÎ™©Ïû•)","description":"Daegwallyeong Sheep Ranch is a privately owned ranch on an area of 195 k„é°.

When no one else was brave enough to find his body, Eom Heung-do, the governor of Yeongwol Lake, found his body and buried him in the tomb that later became Jangneung, one of the royal tombs of the Joseon dynasty. Danjong had been stripped of his title at the time he was exiled. His title was later restored in year 1698, during the reign of King Sukjong, and received his posthumous name Danjong, and thereafter was referred to as King Danjong. <br><br>Jangneung houses such buildings as Jeongjagak, Baesikdansa, Jaesil, Yeongcheon, and Hongsammun, and a history hall with relics of Danjong. The area is surrounded by magnificent pine trees. Since 1967, a religious service called Danjongje is held every year on April 5th, according to the lunar calendar, in commemoration of Danjong.","regDate":"2022-10-01","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-01-1664600620874/564597_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-01-1664600620874"},{"id":"2022-09-30-1664534949242","title":"Isabu Lion Park & Picture Book Land (Ïù¥ÏÇ¨Î∂ÄÏÇ¨ÏûêÍ≥µÏõê&Í∑∏Î¶ºÏ±Ö ÎÇòÎùº)","description":"Isabu Lion Park & Picture Book Land is a family-friendly theme park that provides the beautiful ocean view of the East Sea up close.
