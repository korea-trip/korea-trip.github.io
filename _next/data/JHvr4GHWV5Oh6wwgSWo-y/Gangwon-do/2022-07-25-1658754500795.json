Chuncheon-style dakgalbi originates from the story in which people marinated chicken instead of pork and grilled it with charcoal like pork ribs in the 1960s. Later, various vegetables, such as cabbage and onion, were added to the dish and stir-fried together on an iron plate. As people can eat it plenty at a reasonable price, dakgalbi has been popular among college students and soldiers, and at this time, dakgalbi earned its nicknames such as “People’s galbi (ribs)”, and “College students’ galbi.” The Dakgalbi Alley was established as dakgalbi restaurants were opened one by one on the backstreet of Myeongdong in Chuncheon, in the 1970s to 1980s. Currently, this 150 m-long alley is packed with dakgalbi restaurants on both sides. Along with charcoal-grilled spicy chicken and spicy griddled chicken, customers can try Chuncheon buckwheat noodles, which are also a famous local delicacy. The information panel explaining the history of Chuncheon spicy stir-fried chicken is installed in the alley. This alley is also known for the filming location for the Korean TV entertainment program Infinite Challenge and other programs.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>• For more info: +82-33-250-4312|\n|parking:|Not available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available inside restaurants|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-25-1658754500795/2364911_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658754500795/2364911_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658754500795/2365605_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658754500795/2365605_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658754500795/2365606_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658754500795/2365606_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658754500795/2365607_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658754500795/2365607_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658754500795/2365608_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658754500795/2365608_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658754500795/700186_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658754500795/700186_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658754500795/700189_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658754500795/700189_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658754500795/700190_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658754500795/700190_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-33-250-4312](tel:+82332504312)\n- [🏠ccdakgalbistreet.modoo.at/</a> (Korean only)<br><a href=\"http://tour.chuncheon.go.kr\" target=\"_blank\">tour.chuncheon.go.kr](http://ccdakgalbistreet.modoo.at/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.8795676643\nlongitude: 127.7276076035\ntitle: Joyang-dong, Chuncheon-si, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Chuncheon Intercity Bus Terminal, take Bus No. 7, 9, 64 or 64-2 and get off at Chuncheon's Myeong-dong Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-25-1658754500795","title":"Chuncheon Myeongdong Dakgalbi Street (춘천 명동 닭갈비 골목)","description":"This alley is lined with dakgalbi (spicy stir-fried chicken) restaurants in Myeong-dong, which is Chuncheon’s high street.
