However, the cave was found to have natural stalactites, and was later developed into the only theme-based cave that combined gold and nature. The ticket booth and the caves entrance is located apart from each other, and visitors can either hike or ride on monorail to the entrance point. Hwaamdonggul Cave is not only a tourist attraction but also an educational venue where visitors can learn about the subterranean ecology of a stalactite cave and the process of gold mining and refining.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-33-560-2379|\n|parking:|Available (Large vehicles: 24 spaces / Small vehicles: 530 spaces)|\n|usetime:|09:00-17:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|[General]<br>Individuals - Adults 5,000 won / Teenagers 3,500 won / Children 2,000 won <br>Group - Adults 4,500 won / Teenagers 3,000 won / Children 1,500 won <br><br>* Free admission for preschoolers (ages 6 or younger) & senior citizens (ages 65 or older).

The lake is a hotspot for aquatic tourism and the lakeside road is an important route that connects Chuncheon and Yanggu. Driving from Chuncheon to the dam will take about one hour, but the Kwaeryongho Boat, a hovercraft that operates regularly on Soyangho Lake, only takes about 30 minutes. The hovercraft travels by ejecting air against the surface below, sending up a spray of water on either side of the boat to the delight of passengers. In the valley, visitors can see fish farms floating among the islets. When the water level is high, it is possible to travel on the lake all the way to Inje and Sinnam, enjoying the beautiful scenery of Seoraksan Mountain. Both tourists and locals regularly make use of the ferry service.","regDate":"2022-10-14","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-14-1665729241153/176171_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-14-1665729241153"},{"id":"2022-10-14-1665723965765","title":"Soyangho Lake (Inje Section) (소양호-인제)","description":"Soyangho Lake (소양호), one of the biggest manmade lakes in Korea, along with Chungjuho Lake (충주호), was created in 1973 when the world’s fourth largest dam, Soyang Dam, standing 123 meters high, was constructed.
