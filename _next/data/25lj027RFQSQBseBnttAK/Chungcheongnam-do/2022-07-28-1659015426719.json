Compared with other Korean fortresses, Imjonseong Fortress is higher and about 2 meters thicker. It is the largest fortress of the Baekje Kingdom and has become the subject of much research.<br><br>History shows that the fortress was the central hub of the Restoration Movement of the Baekje Kingdom (18 BC - 660 AD). In the 20th year of the reign of King Uija (Baekje dynasty), the kingdom was defeated by the united forces of the Silla Kingdom and the Tang dynasty (currently, China). Boksin (a cousin of King Uisa), a monk, and Heukchisangji stayed at the fortress for three years while trying to return the king to power.<br><br>As you walk along the winding trail, you’ll be able to see Daeryeonsa Temple and as you continue to the top, you’ll be treated to spectacular views of Oseosan, Baekwolsan, and Gayasan mountains.
