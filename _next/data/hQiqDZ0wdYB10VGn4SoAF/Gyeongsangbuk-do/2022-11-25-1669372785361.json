Rock art from the time period was created on rocks or other planes considered to be sacred and usually carried a message of fertility. The artwork of Yangjeondong shows layered circles (symbolizing the sun and the moon), crosses (depicting the “life zone” of the tribe), and 17 masks. The artwork is considered to have been used for ceremonial purposes or farming events.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-54-955-2201|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-25-1669372785361/1004045_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-25-1669372785361/1004045_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-25-1669372785361/2493151_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-25-1669372785361/2493151_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-25-1669372785361/2493154_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-25-1669372785361/2493154_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-25-1669372785361/2493155_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-25-1669372785361/2493155_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-25-1669372785361/2493156_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-25-1669372785361/2493156_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-25-1669372785361/2493157_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-25-1669372785361/2493157_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-25-1669372785361/2493158_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-25-1669372785361/2493158_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-25-1669372785361/2493263_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-25-1669372785361/2493263_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.7128155575\nlongitude: 128.2921603954\ntitle: 15-5, Araealteo-gil, Goryeong-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus + Taxi]<BR>\nFrom Goryeong Bus Terminal, take a taxi to Yangjeondong Rock Art. <br><br>OR, <br>Take a local bus bound for Gaejin and get off at Hayangjeon Bus Stop.<br>Walk for approx. 600m\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-25-1669372785361","title":"Goryeong Janggi-ri Rock Art (고령 장기리 암각화)","description":"Yangjeondong Rock Art (discovered in 1971) is a rock painting 3 meters high and 5.5 meters wide that vividly depicts the life and religion of the Prehistoric Age.

Aside from the fact that it is circled by a protective two-layer rock, the tomb has no other unique features. As the oldest daughter of King Jinpyeong, Queen Seondeok became the first queen of the Silla Kingdom. During the 16th year of her reign, Bunhwangsa Temple and Cheomseongdae Observatory were built. She also ordered the construction of the famous nine-story wooden pagoda of Hwangyongsa Temple, a significant achievement of Buddhist architecture. While many of her efforts laid the foundation for the unification of Three Kingdoms of Korea, Queen Seondeok’s reign was plagued by rebellion and strife and she died in 647 during a rebellion, 23 years before unification was realized.","regDate":"2022-12-07","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-07-1670398594153/179719_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-07-1670398594153"},{"id":"2022-12-07-1670395284321","title":"Tomb of King Wonseong (경주 원성왕릉)","description":"The tomb of the King Wonseong, 38th king of the Silla Kingdom (785-798) in Oedong-eup, Wolseong-gun, Gyeongju is Historic Site No. 26.

The king gave specific instructions to be buried in the East Sea after his death so that he would become a dragon and protect Silla from foreign invaders. The rocky island, about 200 meters in circumference, is divided by a cross-shaped waterway, forming a pool at the center, at the bottom of which is a granite stone 3.6 meters long, 2.9 meters wide and 0.9 meters thick. Legend has it that the remains of King Munmu’s cremated body are buried under this rock. Historians still debate whether the ashes of the King Munmu were scattered or stored in an urn and placed under the rock.","regDate":"2022-12-07","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-07-1670391364282/1613346_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-07-1670391364282"},{"id":"2022-12-07-1670388081385","title":"The POSCO Museum  (포스코 역사관)","description":"The POSCO Museum shows the history, spirit, corporate culture and vision of POSCO.
