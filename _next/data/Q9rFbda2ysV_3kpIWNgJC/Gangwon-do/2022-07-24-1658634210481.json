The village was formed by refugees of the Korean War from North Korea, mainly from Hamgyeong-do Province. The word ‚Äúabai‚Äù is a dialect of Hamgyeong-do that means a friendly old man like a grandfather. Visitors to Abai Village can get a sense of displaced people‚Äôs life and story, which fade away into a chapter of history. Although it has lost its original appearance now, old shacks without a gate still remain here and there. Mural paintings on the wall show the sentiment of nostalgia about their hometown and express sorrow and hard life of displaced people, who lived from hand to mouth by fishing and doing physical labor. The original houses built by refugees in the village were restored into the Refugee Village at the Sokcho Museum. Abai Village is also known as a filming location for the Korean TV drama Autumn in My Heart, attracting a lot of visitors and becoming a major attraction in Sokcho. The restaurant alley is packed with cafes and North Korean food restaurants serving local dishes such as Hamheung-style cold buckwheat noodles, stuffed squid, and North Korean-style sausage soup.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|expagerange:|Open to visitors of all ages|\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-33-639-2690|\n|parking:|Available (50 spaces)|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Open 24 hr|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Film Locations:|KBS drama \"Autumn in My Heart (2000)\"|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Available Facilities:|Abai Village, Abai Village Ferry|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Not available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-24-1658634210481/2657595_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658634210481/2657595_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658634210481/2657596_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658634210481/2657596_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658634210481/2657597_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658634210481/2657597_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658634210481/2657600_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658634210481/2657600_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658634210481/2657601_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658634210481/2657601_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658634210481/2711174_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658634210481/2711174_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658634210481/2711175_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658634210481/2711175_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658634210481/2711176_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658634210481/2711176_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658634210481/2711177_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658634210481/2711177_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-33-639-2690](tel:+82336392690)\n- [üè†www.abai.co.kr](http://www.abai.co.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 38.2007412589\nlongitude: 128.5949161776\ntitle: 122-1, Cheongho-ro, Sokcho-si, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>\nFrom Seoul Express Bus Terminal or Dong Seoul Bus Terminal, take a bus to Sokcho Bus Terminal.<BR>\nFrom Sokcho Express Bus Terminal Bus Stop, take Bus No. 1, 7, or 9  or from Sokcho Intercity Bus Terminal Bus Stop, take Bus No. 7-1 or 9-1 and get off at City Hall Bus Stop.<BR>\nWalk for approx. 5 min and take a boat to Cheongho-dong.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-24-1658634210481","title":"Abai Village (ÏïÑÎ∞îÏù¥ ÎßàÏùÑ)","description":"Located in Cheongho-dong, Abai Village bears a history of displaced people‚Äôs distress.
