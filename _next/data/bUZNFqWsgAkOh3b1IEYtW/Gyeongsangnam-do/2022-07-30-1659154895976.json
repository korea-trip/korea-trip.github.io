It is said to have been built to appease the spirit of a young woman named Arang, who met an unfortunate death. <br><br>\n\nAccording to the legend, Arang was mistakenly killed by a low-ranking officer who had loved her and tried to hug her. After her death, she becomes a ghost and appears to every district magistrate (highest-ranking officer in a region) to appeal for the investigation of her unfair death, but each district magistrate dies of a heart attack. <br><br>\nThen, a new district magistrate by the name Lee is dispatched to the area. Unlike his predecessors, Lee listens to the story of the ghost and finds the low-ranked officer who had killed her and punishes him. He found Arang‚Äôs body and holded a religious ceremony on her behalf. Aranggak was also built in her memory. <br><br>\n\nEvery year, an event called Arangje is held on April 16 by the lunar calendar in Aranggak Pavilion. Young maidens dressed in white hanbok perform a religious ceremony to soothe the sorrow of Arang. There is also a saying that the spirit of Arang will preserve the love of those couples who visit the pavilion together.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<BR> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-55-359-5788|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-30-1659154895976/2589450_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659154895976/2589450_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659154895976/2589451_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659154895976/2589451_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-55-359-5788](tel:+82553595788)\n- [üè†tour.miryang.go.kr</a> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br /> <a href=\"http://www.cha.go.kr/\">www.cha.go.kr](http://tour.miryang.go.kr/main/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.4914906717\nlongitude: 128.7556646276\ntitle: 324, Jungang-ro, Miryang-si, Gyeongsangnam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Train]<BR>\nFrom Seoul Station, take a train to Miryang Station.<br>\nFrom Miryang Station, take Bus No. 2, 2 Cheongun, 2 Chodong, 3 Sangdong, 6, or 6 Hwalseong and get off at Yeongnamnu Pavilion Bus Stop.<br>Walk for approx. 150m to arrive at Aranggak.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-30-1659154895976","title":"Aranggak Pavilion (ÏïÑÎûëÍ∞Å)","description":"Located in Naeil-dong in Miryang, Gyeongsangnam-do Province, Aranggak Pavilion sits in a bamboo forest.

Chokseongnu (historically known as ‚ÄòJangwollu‚Äô) has undergone eight renovations since its establishment in the 28th year of King Gojong (1241, Goryeo dynasty) and was once used as a commanding post for defending Jinju Palace in times of war. During times of peace, it was used for holding state examinations. <br><br>Although the structure was burnt down during the Korean War, it was restored in 1960 through the efforts of the Jinju Historical Site Preservation Society. The roof design features a mix of hipped and gabled styles and the stone pillars were built with rocks collected from Chokseoksan Mountain, located in Changwon-si. The wood used for the structure was brought from Odaesan Mountain, situated in Gangwon-do. Noticeable features of Chokseongnu are the four engraved signboards and a board that holds the works of renowned poets and calligraphers. Jinju Namgang Yudeung (Lantern) Festival is held every fall at the Jinjuseong Fortress.","regDate":"2022-07-30","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-30-1659199947652/2367499_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-07-30-1659199947652"},{"id":"2022-07-30-1659195649711","title":"Choi Champandaek (House of Choi Champan) (ÏµúÏ∞∏ÌåêÎåÅ)","description":"The House of Choi Champan is known as the setting of the famous novel \"Toji\" (\"The Land\") by noted novelist Park Kyongni.
