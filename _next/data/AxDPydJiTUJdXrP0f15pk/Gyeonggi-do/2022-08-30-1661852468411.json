It is easily recognized by the written records inscribed into the rock wall. Located at the hermitage is the Rock-carved Seated Buddha, an original work of the hermitage that is also designated Gyeonggi-do‚Äôs Tangible Cultural Asset No. 102. The Buddha is embossed inside a deep hole in the rock. In the words inscribed near the statue, there is also a legend that says Lee Gu-seung carved Gwaneum Statue near Rock-carved Seated Buddha and built the hermitage in 1897. <br><br>Next to the hermitage is a pond called ‚ÄúBokumul,‚Äù which means ‚Äúblessed sugared water.‚Äù The neighborhood of Bojeong-dong takes its name from this pond. At the hermitage, Daeungjeon Hall (the main hall), Samseonggak Shrine (shrine for three spirits), and Mireukjeon Hall were all established fairly recently. The hermitage site also includes a huge Mireuk Daebul statue (Great State of Maitreya Buddha) and a five-story stone pagoda.","regDate":"2022-08-31","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-31-1661932387069/2021847_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-08-31-1661932387069"},{"id":"2022-08-31-1661928156757","title":"La Vie D'or Resort & Country Club (ÎùºÎπÑÎèåÎ¶¨Ï°∞Ìä∏)","description":"Located 30 minutes from Seoul, LA VIE D'OR Resort & Country Club is a large (330,578 meters square) leisure complex appropriate for visitors of all ages.
