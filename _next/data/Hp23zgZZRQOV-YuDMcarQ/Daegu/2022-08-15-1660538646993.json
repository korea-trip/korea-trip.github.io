The two-story red brick building has maintained its original construction, with only minor changes having been made over the years. The house is very representative of its time, with a brick chimney rising over the roof, and wooden flooring inside. The first floor was made up of a veranda, reception room, living room, bedrooms, dining room and kitchen. The second floor featured bedrooms and a bathroom. The windows can be opened both at the top and the bottom, and the veranda was used as a sunroom. The House of Missionary Blair is a great example of American architecture from the 1900's.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-53-661-2193|\n|parking:|Not available|\n|restdate:|Sundays & Public holidays|\n|usetime:|Weekdays 10:00-12:00 / 13:00-17:00 <br />Saturdays 10:00-12:00<br />* Last admission one hour before closing|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Restrooms:|Not available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-15-1660538646993/2366083_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-15-1660538646993/2366083_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-15-1660538646993/2366085_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-15-1660538646993/2366085_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-53-661-2193](tel:+82536612193)\n- [🏠gu.jung.daegu.kr</a> (Korean, English) <BR> <a href=\"http://www.cha.go.kr\" target=\"_blank\">www.cha.go.kr](http://gu.jung.daegu.kr/new/culture)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.8666090647\nlongitude: 128.5849525818\ntitle: 2029, Dalgubeol-daero, Jung-gu, Daegu\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \nFrom Dongdaegu KTX Station Bus Stop, take Rapid Bus No. 1 to Seomyuhoegwan 1 Bus Stop.
