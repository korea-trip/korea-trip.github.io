He is also known as King Guhae or King Yang, and is the grandfather of Kim Yoo Shin. Since becoming the King of Gaya in 521 AD, he reigned for 11 years until he handed over his country to King Beopheung of the Silla Kingdom in 532 AD.<br><br>There are two different scholarly opinions  about this tomb. One is that it should be classified&nbsp;as a stone pagoda and the other, a royal tomb. The reason why this was regarded as a pagoda is that there are similarly shaped stone pagodas in the Andong and Uiseong regions. The basis for it being called Wangreung, or royal tomb, is that there is a record in Dongguk Yeoji Seongram (an ancient history book published during the rule of King Seongjong in the Joseon dynasty) and in Saneum-hyeon Sancheonjo (a record of events in the region) of it being a tomb. The notes state that there is a structure with steps on the four faces, in the form of nine dragons piled up of stones at a distance of about 16 km (40 ri&nbsp;in traditional Korean scale) from the village, so people believe it must be a royal tomb.<br><br> The record describing the name of the king buried in this tomb can be extracted from a record of travels called Wangsan Shimreunggi written by Hong Ui Young, a Joseon dynasty scholar. In addition, there‚Äôs also an entry&nbsp; in Wangsansagi, a book on the history of Wangsansa Temple (a temple located  west of the tomb) that the person buried in the tomb is King Guhyeong.<br><br>Unlike ordinary graves, the tomb is built at&nbsp;the middle part of the hills slope. The tomb has a unique appearance made up of steps and layers, with the highest point being 7.15 meters high. There are seven layers at the front and no steps at the back due to it being built on an inclined surface. The overall shape of this tomb is different from the pyramids built on level ground.  The top of the tomb is  oval in shape. At the center, there is a stone tablet with the words Royal Tomb of King Yang of the Garak Nation. In front of the tomb, there are several stone pieces that have been added to the original tomb. <br><br>During the 17th Year of King Jeongjo of the Joseon dynasty (1793), a wooden box that was passed down from generation to generation in Wangsansa<i> </i>Temple was discovered. The box contained portraits of King Guhyeong and his queen, their clothes, an archery bow, and other objects. To preserve these, a royal building called Deogyangjeon Hall was constructed. To this date, a memorial service is held here in spring and autumn of every year.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-55-970-6411~4|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Night-time Hike Restriction Notice:|Night-time hiking is restricted for safety and forest fire prevention reasons|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-25-1671957393021/211626_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-25-1671957393021/211626_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-25-1671957393021/211627_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-25-1671957393021/211627_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-25-1671957393021/487643_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-25-1671957393021/487643_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-25-1671957393021/487644_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-25-1671957393021/487644_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-25-1671957393021/792946_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-25-1671957393021/792946_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-25-1671957393021/792956_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-25-1671957393021/792956_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-25-1671957393021/792964_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-25-1671957393021/792964_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-25-1671957393021/792979_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-25-1671957393021/792979_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-25-1671957393021/792989_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-25-1671957393021/792989_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-25-1671957393021/211625_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-25-1671957393021/211625_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-55-970-6411](tel:+82559706411)\n- [üè†www.sancheong.go.kr/tour/index.do</a> (Korean only)<br /><a href=\"http://www.cha.go.kr/\" target=\"_blank\" >www.cha.go.kr](http://www.sancheong.go.kr/tour/index.do)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.4493504251\nlongitude: 127.8006607897\ntitle: Guhyeongwangneung-ro, Sancheong-gun, Gyeongsangnam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>From Seoul Nambu Terminal, take an intercity bus to Sancheong Intercity Bus Terminal.<BR> Cross the street and at Sancheong Terminal Bus Stop, take a bus bound for Sancheong-Banggok (Hwagae) and get off at Gu-a Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-25-1671957393021","title":"Tomb of King Guhyeong, Sancheong (ÏÇ∞Ï≤≠¬†Ï†Ñ¬†Íµ¨ÌòïÏôïÎ¶â)","description":"This stone grave is known to be the tomb of King Guhyeong, the 10th King of the Gaya Kingdom.

It was named so because the leaves turn so crimson that the water of the valley reflects the color and appears crimson as well. This is the place where Chi-Won Choe, after returning from Dang China to Silla (BC 57-AD 935) found Korea in disarray. It was too much to bear for him so he retired to live privately with poetry until his death. <br><br>There are 19 famous places in Hongryudonggyegok Valley, including major cultural assets like Jongsangjeong Pavilion, Nakhwadam, and Bunokpok. The scenery of Nongsanjeong Pavilion, where Chi-Won Choe read poetry and played baduk, is especially beautiful.  On the opposite side is a rock where you can see the handwring of Chi-Won Choe. The Yongmunpokpo Falls, located on the north end of the valley, has beautiful scenery with its harmonious blend of falling water and Giamgoiseok (fantastic rocks and stones).  <br><br>The scenery of Hongryudonggyegok Valley changes every season, and it is the finest part of Gayasan Mountain. It is famous for the azaleas in full bloom during the spring, and for the thousand-year-old pine trees and broad-leaved trees growing thickly throughout the valley and the cool, clear water that runs through it during the summer. In the fall, the nearby pine tree forests and broad-leaved trees tinge in color and accentuate the crimson foliage of autumnal leaves, making the crimson reflection of the leaves in the valley water look like a rising flame, and shows why the valley was named Hongryudonggyegok Valley.","regDate":"2022-12-28","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Valleys"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-28-1672212935139/2625847_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-28-1672212935139"},{"id":"2022-12-28-1672209537187","title":"Hapcheon Okgyeseowon Confucian Academy (Ïò•Í≥ÑÏÑúÏõê(Ìï©Ï≤ú))","description":"Hapcheon Okgyeseowon Confucian Academy was built to store Yulgok Yi Is writings, Gyeokmongyogyeol and Haedongyeonwonnok.
