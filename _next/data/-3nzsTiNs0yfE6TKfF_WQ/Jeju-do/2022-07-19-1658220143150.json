The fortress is about 950 meters in  circumference. The oval \nfortress was built in consideration of the location's topography having a higher terrain in the southern part and a lower terrain in the northern part. Of all the fortresses in Jeju, Byeolbangjin Fortress is in relatively good shape. The fortress is also an important example of how fortresses in Jeju were built and in what scale.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-64-740-6000|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-19-1658220143150/1618272_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658220143150/1618272_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658220143150/1618273_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658220143150/1618273_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658220143150/1618274_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658220143150/1618274_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658220143150/192239_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658220143150/192239_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658220143150/192240_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658220143150/192240_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658220143150/192241_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658220143150/192241_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658220143150/2513544_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658220143150/2513544_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658220143150/2513545_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658220143150/2513545_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658220143150/2513546_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658220143150/2513546_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658220143150/2513547_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658220143150/2513547_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-64-740-6000](tel:+82647406000)\n- [üè†visitjeju.net</a> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese, Malay)<br><a href=\"http://www.cha.go.kr/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"New window popup\" class=\"web\">www.cha.go.kr](http://www.visitjeju.net/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.5262082208\nlongitude: 126.8843912035\ntitle: Haemajihaean-ro, Jeju-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Jeju Intercity Bus Terminal, take the East Coast Line (Jeju.
