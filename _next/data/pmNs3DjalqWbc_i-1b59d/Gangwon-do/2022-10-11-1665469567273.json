Sandglass Park has pine trees, benches facing the sea, and access to Jeongdongjin Beach. At the center of the park is a giant sandglass that is set to measure one year. Sandglass Park was established in 1999 by the city of Gangneung and Samsung Electronics Co. to commemorate the upcoming millennium. Part of this commemoration was the building of the giant sandglass at the park. The sandglass has a diameter of 8.06 meters, x_width of 3.2 meters, weight of 40 tons and holds 8 tons of sand, making it one of the biggest sandglasses in the world.
