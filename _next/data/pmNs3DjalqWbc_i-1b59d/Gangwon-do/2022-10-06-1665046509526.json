The uppermost section, known as Gaetmaeul Beach, is 310 meters long and 69 meters wide and is ideal for a quiet and peaceful vacation. It is also a treasure trove of biodiversity and hosts interesting events that change every year. The second beach right below is Namae 3-ri Beach, a 504 meter-long, 77 meter-wide beach with shallow waters and fine sand and a host of accommodations and amenities serving tourists. The southernmost beach is Namae 1-ri Beach, a small beach that is 396 meters in length and 36 meters in x_width. It is a popular fishing site because of the large number of rocks along the shore, and its relative obscurity keeps the beach clean and tidy. The nearby Namaehang Port is said to be one of the “Three Beautiful Ports on the East Coast,” and a famous sunrise spot. Namaehang Skywalk and Undersea Experiential Learning Center can be found nearby as well.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-33-670-2518|\n|opendate:|July 12 – August 25|\n|parking:|Available (Approx. 30 spaces)|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Open year round (Beach opening hours 09:00–18:00)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Facility Utilization Fees:|Free|\n|Available Facilities:|Namae Beach|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Not available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-10-06-1665046509526/2711370_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665046509526/2711370_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-06-1665046509526/2711371_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665046509526/2711371_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-33-670-2518](tel:+82336702518)\n- [🏠tour.yangyang.go.kr](https://tour.yangyang.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.9537289159\nlongitude: 128.7695747138\ntitle: 14, Maeho-gil, Yangyang-gun, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-10-06-1665046509526","title":"Namae Beach (남애해수욕장)","description":"Namae Beach, located in Namae-ri, Yangyang-gun, is divided into three sections.
