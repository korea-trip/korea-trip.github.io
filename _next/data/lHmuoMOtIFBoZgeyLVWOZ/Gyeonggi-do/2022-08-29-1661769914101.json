Thick forests of pine trees create a rooftop of branches from spring to fall. Being surrounded by the tall mountains of Baegunsan, Yumyeongsan, and Yongmunsan, Jungmisan Mountain feels like it is in the inner mountainous region of Gangwon-do, although it is close to Seoul.\n<br><br>\nThe forest has log cabins that can accommodate groups of 4 to 10 people as well as campsites that complement the surrounding natural environment. Visitors can enjoy a comfortable walk through the trees on a trail that winds through the heart of the forest.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Korea Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-31-771-7166|\n|opendate:|1991|\n|useseason:|March-November|\n|usetime:|[Daily] 09:00-18:00<br>[Accommodation] Check in - From 15:00 / Check out - 12:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Accommodations<BR>Convenience facilities - walking trail, hiking trail, forest park. etc. <br> Education facilities - Forest experience course<br>Sports facility - playground <br>Drinking fountain|\n|Facility Utilization Fees:|[Accommodations] <BR>Forest Cabin: 46,000~184,000 won<br>Lodging Complex: 77,000~134,000 won <BR>Camping Facility: 6,000~8,500 won<BR>* For detailed information, check the official website|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-29-1661769914101/607979_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661769914101/607979_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-29-1661769914101/607983_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661769914101/607983_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-29-1661769914101/607987_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661769914101/607987_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-29-1661769914101/607992_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661769914101/607992_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-29-1661769914101/608001_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661769914101/608001_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-29-1661769914101/608005_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661769914101/608005_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-29-1661769914101/608009_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661769914101/608009_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-29-1661769914101/608018_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661769914101/608018_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-29-1661769914101/1589830_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661769914101/1589830_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-29-1661769914101/607974_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661769914101/607974_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-31-771-7166](tel:+82317717166)\n- [üè†www.foresttrip.go.kr](https://www.foresttrip.go.kr/indvz/main.do?hmpgId=0108)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5818000399\nlongitude: 127.4571548101\ntitle: 1152, Jungmisan-ro, Yangpyeong-gun, Gyeonggi-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-29-1661769914101","title":"Jungmisan Recreational Forest (Ï§ëÎØ∏ÏÇ∞ÏûêÏó∞Ìú¥ÏñëÎ¶º)","description":"Jungmisan Recreational Forest unfolds at the end of a lovely drive along the famous Nongdachigogae Road, the highest ridge road in the vicinity of Seoul.

Visitors can feel the peaceful and serene atmosphere when walking around the site.

Manggyeongam Hermitage is said to be the place where kings of the late Goryeo and early Joseon periods prayed for peace for their subjects. In addition, Prince Pyeongwon, the 7th son of King Sejong, and Grand Prince Jean built an altar at Mangyeongam Hermitage and Chilseongdae Peak and pledged filial piety. <br><br>The hermitage is more widely known for its connection to the Chilseong faith, in which believers worship Chilseong (the Seven Stars). It is easily recognized by the written records inscribed into the rock wall. Located at the hermitage is the Rock-carved Seated Buddha, an original work of the hermitage that is also designated Gyeonggi-do‚Äôs Tangible Cultural Asset No. 102. The Buddha is embossed inside a deep hole in the rock. In the words inscribed near the statue, there is also a legend that says Lee Gu-seung carved Gwaneum Statue near Rock-carved Seated Buddha and built the hermitage in 1897. <br><br>Next to the hermitage is a pond called ‚ÄúBokumul,‚Äù which means ‚Äúblessed sugared water.‚Äù The neighborhood of Bojeong-dong takes its name from this pond. At the hermitage, Daeungjeon Hall (the main hall), Samseonggak Shrine (shrine for three spirits), and Mireukjeon Hall were all established fairly recently. The hermitage site also includes a huge Mireuk Daebul statue (Great State of Maitreya Buddha) and a five-story stone pagoda.","regDate":"2022-08-31","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-31-1661932387069/2021847_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-08-31-1661932387069"},{"id":"2022-08-31-1661928156757","title":"La Vie D'or Resort & Country Club (ÎùºÎπÑÎèåÎ¶¨Ï°∞Ìä∏)","description":"Located 30 minutes from Seoul, LA VIE D'OR Resort & Country Club is a large (330,578 meters square) leisure complex appropriate for visitors of all ages.
