This neighborhood expanded into an art complex when artists from diverse fields of expertise began to gather during the development process of Paju Book City. The village‚Äôs name originates from Paju‚Äôs local song ‚ÄúHeyri Sound,‚Äù sung by farmers while working at the fields. The whole neighborhood is like a masterpiece due to the artworks displayed along the streets in harmony with nature‚Äôs beauty. The buildings were carefully designed as to prevent the manmade structures getting in the way from admiring the surrounding nature. For example, the neighborhood‚Äôs streets were designed to follow the curves set by nature without using any asphalt.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-31-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-31-946-8551|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|Mondays (Refer to website for details)|\n|usetime:|Varies by area (Refer to website for details)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Gallery, exhibition hall, museum, theater, art shop, book store, guesthouse, restaurant, cafe|\n|Admission Fees:|Free<br>* Fees may apply to exhibitions and galleries.|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706540_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706540_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706541_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706541_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706548_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706548_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706550_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706550_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706552_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706552_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706553_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706553_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706555_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706555_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706557_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706557_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706558_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706558_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706538_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706538_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-31-946-8551](tel:+82319468551)\n- [üè†www.heyri.net](http://heyri.net)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.7880651301\nlongitude: 126.6993124807\ntitle: 70-21, Heyrimaeul-gil, Paju-si, Gyeonggi-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway + Bus]<br>\n Hapjeong Station (Seoul Subway Line 2), Exit 2. <br> Take Bus No. 2200 or 900 and get off at Heyri Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-26-1661499675782","title":"Heyri Art Valley (Ìó§Ïù¥Î¶¨ ÏòàÏà†ÎßàÏùÑ)","description":"Heyri Art Valley is a neighborhood of inspiration, creative workshops, exhibitions, festivals, and education of all things creative arts.

Visitors can feel the peaceful and serene atmosphere when walking around the site.

Manggyeongam Hermitage is said to be the place where kings of the late Goryeo and early Joseon periods prayed for peace for their subjects. In addition, Prince Pyeongwon, the 7th son of King Sejong, and Grand Prince Jean built an altar at Mangyeongam Hermitage and Chilseongdae Peak and pledged filial piety. <br><br>The hermitage is more widely known for its connection to the Chilseong faith, in which believers worship Chilseong (the Seven Stars). It is easily recognized by the written records inscribed into the rock wall. Located at the hermitage is the Rock-carved Seated Buddha, an original work of the hermitage that is also designated Gyeonggi-do‚Äôs Tangible Cultural Asset No. 102. The Buddha is embossed inside a deep hole in the rock. In the words inscribed near the statue, there is also a legend that says Lee Gu-seung carved Gwaneum Statue near Rock-carved Seated Buddha and built the hermitage in 1897. <br><br>Next to the hermitage is a pond called ‚ÄúBokumul,‚Äù which means ‚Äúblessed sugared water.‚Äù The neighborhood of Bojeong-dong takes its name from this pond. At the hermitage, Daeungjeon Hall (the main hall), Samseonggak Shrine (shrine for three spirits), and Mireukjeon Hall were all established fairly recently. The hermitage site also includes a huge Mireuk Daebul statue (Great State of Maitreya Buddha) and a five-story stone pagoda.","regDate":"2022-08-31","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-31-1661932387069/2021847_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-08-31-1661932387069"},{"id":"2022-08-31-1661928156757","title":"La Vie D'or Resort & Country Club (ÎùºÎπÑÎèåÎ¶¨Ï°∞Ìä∏)","description":"Located 30 minutes from Seoul, LA VIE D'OR Resort & Country Club is a large (330,578 meters square) leisure complex appropriate for visitors of all ages.
