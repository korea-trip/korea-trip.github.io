{"pageProps":{"content":"![Janganmun Gate (Ïû•ÏïàÎ¨∏)](/2022-08-28-1661679576836/2367187_image2_1.webp)\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> Janganmun Gate is the main gate of Hwaseong Fortress at the northern wall. <em>Jangan</em> means capital, implying that Hwaseong Fortress is the secondary capital. Janganmun Gate served as the main gate because the king would pass from this gate when arriving from Hanyang, the capital city, now modern-day Seoul. It is interesting to note that this gate is larger than Sungryemun Gate in Seoul.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-031-228-4416|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|March-October 09:00-18:00<br>November-February 09:00-17:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|[Suwon Hawseong Fortress]<br>Adults: Individuals 1,000 won / Groups 700 won<br>Teenagers: Individuals 700 won / Groups 500 won<br>Children: Individuals 500 won / Groups 300 won<br><br>[Hwaseong Haenggung Palace] <br>Adults: Individuals 1,500 won / Groups 1,200 won<br>Teenagers: Individuals 1,000 won / Groups 800 won<br>Children: Individuals 700 won / Groups 500 won<br><br>* Groups: 20 persons or more|\n|Parking Fees:|Small/Mid-sized car 2,000 won for 3 hours / 10,000 won for one-day<br>Large-sized car 4,000 won for 3 hours / 15,000 won for one-day<br>* 200 won for each additional 10 minutes after 3 hours|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|English, Japanese|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-28-1661679576836/734408_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-28-1661679576836/734408_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-28-1661679576836/734409_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-28-1661679576836/734409_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-28-1661679576836/734411_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-28-1661679576836/734411_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-28-1661679576836/734412_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-28-1661679576836/734412_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-28-1661679576836/1092241_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-28-1661679576836/1092241_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-28-1661679576836/2514364_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-28-1661679576836/2514364_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-28-1661679576836/2514365_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-28-1661679576836/2514365_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-28-1661679576836/2514366_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-28-1661679576836/2514366_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-28-1661679576836/2514367_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-28-1661679576836/2514367_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-031-228-4416](tel:+820312284416)\n- [üè†suwon.go.kr</a> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br><a href=\"http://www.swcf.or.kr/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"web\">www.swcf.or.kr](http://www.suwon.go.kr/web/visitsuwon/index.do)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.2888704361\nlongitude: 127.0142422513\ntitle: 910, Jeongjo-ro, Paldal-gu, Suwon-si, Gyeonggi-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nSuwon Station (Seoul Subway Line 1), Underground Shopping Mall Exit 3.

Visitors can feel the peaceful and serene atmosphere when walking around the site.

Manggyeongam Hermitage is said to be the place where kings of the late Goryeo and early Joseon periods prayed for peace for their subjects. In addition, Prince Pyeongwon, the 7th son of King Sejong, and Grand Prince Jean built an altar at Mangyeongam Hermitage and Chilseongdae Peak and pledged filial piety. <br><br>The hermitage is more widely known for its connection to the Chilseong faith, in which believers worship Chilseong (the Seven Stars). It is easily recognized by the written records inscribed into the rock wall. Located at the hermitage is the Rock-carved Seated Buddha, an original work of the hermitage that is also designated Gyeonggi-do‚Äôs Tangible Cultural Asset No. 102. The Buddha is embossed inside a deep hole in the rock. In the words inscribed near the statue, there is also a legend that says Lee Gu-seung carved Gwaneum Statue near Rock-carved Seated Buddha and built the hermitage in 1897. <br><br>Next to the hermitage is a pond called ‚ÄúBokumul,‚Äù which means ‚Äúblessed sugared water.‚Äù The neighborhood of Bojeong-dong takes its name from this pond. At the hermitage, Daeungjeon Hall (the main hall), Samseonggak Shrine (shrine for three spirits), and Mireukjeon Hall were all established fairly recently. The hermitage site also includes a huge Mireuk Daebul statue (Great State of Maitreya Buddha) and a five-story stone pagoda.","regDate":"2022-08-31","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-31-1661932387069/2021847_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-08-31-1661932387069"},{"id":"2022-08-31-1661928156757","title":"La Vie D'or Resort & Country Club (ÎùºÎπÑÎèåÎ¶¨Ï°∞Ìä∏)","description":"Located 30 minutes from Seoul, LA VIE D'OR Resort & Country Club is a large (330,578 meters square) leisure complex appropriate for visitors of all ages.
