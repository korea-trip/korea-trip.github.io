The island was revealed when seawaters were blocked during a land reclamation project. As the sedimentary layer formed during the Cretaceous period of the Mesozoic Era (dated around 83 million to 85 million years ago) was eroded by weathering, roughly 200 dinosaur eggs in thirty nests were discovered at twelve dig sites. It is anticipated that more fossils will be discovered once a thorough investigation is carried out and more land is reclaimed.\n<br><be>\nMost dinosaur eggs are oval shaped and dark red. Considering the properties of the fossilized shells, the eggs that have been discovered so far are assumed to belong to four-legged herbivorous dinosaurs with a long neck and tail, and two-legged herbivorous dinosaurs, including the hadrosaur. A wide range of plant fossils were also discovered alongside the fossilized eggs, leading to expectations that the formerly lush environment may yet be restored.\n<br><br>\nThe discovery of the Fossilized Dinosaur Egg Site in Hwaseong has greatly expanded the scope of Korean paleontology; previous paleontological discoveries were exclusively limited to fossilized dinosaur footprints. This significant discovery has attracted many internationally renowned scholars who have visited the site in Hwaseong.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-31-5189-3508~6|\n|parking:|Available (29 parking spaces: 4 spaces for large-sized cars / 25 spaces for small & middle-sized cars)|\n|restdate:|Mondays, New Year's Day, Seollal (Lunar New Year's Day) & Chuseok (Korean Thanksgiving Day) holidays|\n|usetime:|09:00-17:00 (Winter 10:00-17:00)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Visitors' center, observation path, learning center, etc.|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-27-1661582774696/2040875_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-27-1661582774696/2040875_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-31-5189-3508](tel:+823151893508)\n- [üè†dinopia.hscity.go.kr</a><br><a href=\"https://tour.hscity.go.kr/NEW/1tour/nature8.jsp\" target=\"_blank\">tour.hscity.go.kr](http://dinopia.hscity.go.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.2623520989\nlongitude: 126.7470061547\ntitle: 659, Gongnyong-ro, Hwaseong-si, Gyeonggi-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-27-1661582774696","title":"Hwaseong Fossilized Dinosaur Egg Site (ÌôîÏÑ± Í≥µÎ£°Ïïå ÌôîÏÑùÏßÄ)","description":"The Hwaseong Fossilized Dinosaur Egg Site was discovered on an island in the tidal plain south of Sihwaho Lake.

Visitors can feel the peaceful and serene atmosphere when walking around the site. The reason it came to be called ‚ÄòMirinae‚Äô is that Korean Catholics came to this place in secret to avoid persecution during the late Joseon dynasty, and the lamplight coming from their homes in the village where they settled resembled the starlight of the Milky Way.","regDate":"2022-08-31","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Holy Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-31-1661935642682/1589723_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-08-31-1661935642682"},{"id":"2022-08-31-1661932387069","title":"Manggyeongam Hermitage (ÎßùÍ≤ΩÏïî)","description":"Manggyeongam‚Äôs name derives from the hermitage's view of Seoul, and is located in Bokjeong-dong of Seongnam, Gyeonggi-do. Manggyeongam Hermitage is said to be the place where kings of the late Goryeo and early Joseon periods prayed for peace for their subjects. In addition, Prince Pyeongwon, the 7th son of King Sejong, and Grand Prince Jean built an altar at Mangyeongam Hermitage and Chilseongdae Peak and pledged filial piety. <br><br>The hermitage is more widely known for its connection to the Chilseong faith, in which believers worship Chilseong (the Seven Stars). It is easily recognized by the written records inscribed into the rock wall. Located at the hermitage is the Rock-carved Seated Buddha, an original work of the hermitage that is also designated Gyeonggi-do‚Äôs Tangible Cultural Asset No. 102. The Buddha is embossed inside a deep hole in the rock. In the words inscribed near the statue, there is also a legend that says Lee Gu-seung carved Gwaneum Statue near Rock-carved Seated Buddha and built the hermitage in 1897. <br><br>Next to the hermitage is a pond called ‚ÄúBokumul,‚Äù which means ‚Äúblessed sugared water.‚Äù The neighborhood of Bojeong-dong takes its name from this pond. At the hermitage, Daeungjeon Hall (the main hall), Samseonggak Shrine (shrine for three spirits), and Mireukjeon Hall were all established fairly recently. The hermitage site also includes a huge Mireuk Daebul statue (Great State of Maitreya Buddha) and a five-story stone pagoda.","regDate":"2022-08-31","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-31-1661932387069/2021847_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-08-31-1661932387069"},{"id":"2022-08-31-1661928156757","title":"La Vie D'or Resort & Country Club (ÎùºÎπÑÎèåÎ¶¨Ï°∞Ìä∏)","description":"Located 30 minutes from Seoul, LA VIE D'OR Resort & Country Club is a large (330,578 meters square) leisure complex appropriate for visitors of all ages.
