It is a historic landmark that once contained several royal tombs, and was known at that time as Hyochangwon. The cemeteries that were originally located in Hyochangwon belonged to Crown Prince Munhyo, King Jeongjo‚Äôs first son who died at the age of five; Royal Noble Consort Uibin of the Seong Clan, King Jeongjo‚Äôs royal concubine and Crown Prince Munhyo‚Äôs mother; Royal Noble Consort Sugui of the Park Clan, King Sunjo‚Äôs royal concubine; and her daughter Princess Yeongon. The royal tombs were moved to Seooreung Tombs in the waning months of the Japanese colonial period. The Japanese empire began the development of Hyochangwon into a park in 1924, and the Japanese governor-general officially assigned the site as a park in 1940.\n<br><Br>\nPresently, several of Korea‚Äôs greatest leaders are buried in Hyochang Park. The remains mostly belong to independence activists including Yoon Bong-gil, Lee Bong-chang, and Baek Jeong-gi, whose graves are collectively known as Samuisa Tomb. A statue of Lee Bong-chang has been built in the graveyard. Among the other patriotic martyrs who are interred in the park are Kim Gu and some of the key figures of the provisional government such as Lee Dong-nyeong, Cha I-seok, and Cho Seong-hwan. An ancestral shrine named Uiyeolsa has been built along the main gate and holds the portraits of the deceased independence activists.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-2-2199-8823|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Kim Koo Museum & Library, Anti-Communist Monument, statue of Lee Bong-chang, statue of Wonhyo, badminton court,  eco-experience center, children's playground, convenience store, drinking fountain, etc.|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-09-1660030622688/1568012_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-09-1660030622688/1568012_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-09-1660030622688/1568013_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-09-1660030622688/1568013_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-09-1660030622688/1568014_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-09-1660030622688/1568014_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-09-1660030622688/1568016_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-09-1660030622688/1568016_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-09-1660030622688/1568017_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-09-1660030622688/1568017_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-2-2199-8823](tel:+82221998823)\n- [üè†hyochangpark.com](https://hyochangpark.com/intro)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5450425860\nlongitude: 126.9634757763\ntitle: 177-18, Hyochangwon-ro, Yongsan-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-09-1660030622688","title":"Seoul Hyochang Park (ÏÑúÏö∏ Ìö®Ï∞ΩÍ≥µÏõê)","description":"Hyochang Park covers 122,245 square meters spanning across Hyochang-dong and Cheongpa 2-dong.

The tomb features three layers of stones topped by a smooth mound, which is a tomb style originating from the Goguryeo dynasty (37 BC-AD 668). The tombs are presumed to belong to one of the earliest leaders of the Baekje dynasty (18 BC-AD 660), which was founded by the people of Goguryeo who had come down southwards to establish a new kingdom around the Hangang River basin. <br><br>The square-shaped fourth tomb features a structure similar to the third tomb. Many pieces of earthenware from the early Baekje era were found in the fourth tomb. Also excavated around this site was a gold spangle earring. The third and fourth tombs have been registered as Historic Site No. 243.
