However, other documents seem to state that Neungin Daedeuk, a disciple of Monk Uisang, established the temple. During the Korean War, many documents related to the temple were destroyed, so much of the history has been lost. In 1972, while reconstruction work was being done on Geungnakjeon Hall, records were discovered stating the hall was repaired in 1363. This discovery gave concrete evidence that Geungnakjeon Hall is the oldest wooden building in the nation.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|expagerange:|Preschoolers accompanied by parent and older|\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-54-853-4181|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Not available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-29-1659084304406/2654213_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659084304406/2654213_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659084304406/2654214_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659084304406/2654214_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659084304406/2654215_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659084304406/2654215_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659084304406/2654217_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659084304406/2654217_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659084304406/2654218_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659084304406/2654218_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659084304406/2654219_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659084304406/2654219_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-54-853-4181](tel:+82548534181)\n- [üè†www.bongjeongsa.org</a><br><a href=\" https://www.templestay.com/temple_info.asp?t_id=bongjeongsa \" target=\"_blank\">www.templestay.com</a><br><a href=\"http://www.tourandong.com/public/sub1/sub1_3.cshtml?seq=1345&idx=2\" target=\"_blank\">www.tourandong.com](http://www.bongjeongsa.org/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.6555679404\nlongitude: 128.6596013369\ntitle: 222, Bongjeongsa-gil, Andong-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-29-1659084304406","title":"Bongjeongsa Temple [UNESCO World Heritage] (Î¥âÏ†ïÏÇ¨ [Ïú†ÎÑ§Ïä§ÏΩî ÏÑ∏Í≥ÑÎ¨∏ÌôîÏú†ÏÇ∞])","description":"Bongjeongsa Temple is believed to have been built in 672 by the Great Buddist Monk Uisang.

In 1598, during the Japanese Invasion of Korea, the top motif was destroyed and the structure was further damaged during the Korean War. The pagoda was repaired in 1962. Rumour has it that the pagoda was once located inside the old Beomnimsa Temple. The Dangganjiju, which is located 5 meters west from the pagoda, supports this story. One can see the small place to keep sculptures of the god on each floor.<br> By looking at these with the tiled roof, it is possible to see what style was fashionable. On the second story from the southern viewpoint, one can see the beautiful remnants of the In Wang-sang statue.
