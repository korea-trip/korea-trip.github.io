In 1598, during the Japanese Invasion of Korea, the top motif was destroyed and the structure was further damaged during the Korean War. The pagoda was repaired in 1962. Rumour has it that the pagoda was once located inside the old Beomnimsa Temple. The Dangganjiju, which is located 5 meters west from the pagoda, supports this story. One can see the small place to keep sculptures of the god on each floor.<br> By looking at these with the tiled roof, it is possible to see what style was fashionable. On the second story from the southern viewpoint, one can see the beautiful remnants of the In Wang-sang statue. It is conveniently located on the left side of an open space at the end of the parking lot at Andong Train Station.","regDate":"2022-11-23","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-23-1669181800462/203583_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-11-23-1669181800462"},{"id":"2022-11-23-1669178571614","title":"Dalgi Mineral Spring [National Geopark] (달기약수탕 (청송 국가지질공원))","description":"Dalgi Mineral Spring was found approximately 130 years ago during construction of a waterway.
