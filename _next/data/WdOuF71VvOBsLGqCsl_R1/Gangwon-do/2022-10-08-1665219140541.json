The peak is made of strange rocks stretching from the foot of the mountain to the top at 900 m above sea level. The peak consists of six rocks, which create a majestic view of the rocky peak. The peak with the circumference of 4 km forms a great panoramic view along with Daecheongbong Peak and Outer Seorak. Ulsan Peak presents an imposing scene, and it was visited by many famous poets and calligraphers including Choe Yeon and Heo Jeok during the Joseon period who left behind their records. In addition, several legends are associated with Ulsan Peak. One day, a heavenly god commanded peaks of all mountains to assemble at Geumgangsan Mountain to create the greatest scenery. However, the Ulsan Peak was too heavy, so it was late for the meeting. Feeling ashamed, it didn’t go back home (Ulsan) directly, and took a rest at Seoraksan Mountain, but stayed there forever. Also, there is a saying that the peak was named after the shape of the rock, which resembles a fence (ul+tari) or a crying (ul) mountain (san). Visitors can get to the Ulsan Peak by starting from the small park and passing through Sinheungsa Temple and Heundeul Rock. At the beginning of the path, it starts with a gentle slope, but after the Heundeul Rock, there are a steep rocky hill and the iron stairs. It requires about 4 hr for getting to and from the peak. It is hard for the elderly or children to climb because of high level of difficulty.","regDate":"2022-10-16","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Resources","Rocks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-16-1665913620696/2711195_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-16-1665913620696"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
