Under the pen name Yeongnang, he was active in literature until his death on September 29, 1950. Among the 80 poems he published, more than 60 were written in this place where he lived a life resisting Japanese imperialism and refusing to change his name to a Japanese name. After he moved to Seoul in 1948, his birthplace was resold several times, but the county of Gangjin-gun bought it in 1985 to restore it to its original state with a thatched-roof. The site features many of the poet’s writing materials and the site has a small well, camellia trees, jangdokdae (a platform where large clay pots used for storing food are kept), persimmon trees, and a peony garden.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-61-430-3363|\n|parking:|Available (Free)|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-02-1659446456971/1606607_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659446456971/1606607_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659446456971/1606608_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659446456971/1606608_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659446456971/1606609_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659446456971/1606609_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659446456971/1606610_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659446456971/1606610_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659446456971/1606611_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659446456971/1606611_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659446456971/1606612_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659446456971/1606612_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659446456971/1606613_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659446456971/1606613_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-61-430-3185](tel:+82614303185)\n- [🏠www.gangjin.go.kr</a> (Korean, English, Chinese, Japanese)<br><a href=\"http://www.cha.go.kr/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"web\">www.cha.go.kr](http://www.gangjin.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 34.6421208134\nlongitude: 126.7651001989\ntitle: 15, Yeongnangsaengga-gil, Gangjin-gun, Jeollanam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \nFrom Seoul Central City Bus Terminal (Express Bus Terminal Station, Subway Line 3, 7, 9), take an intercity bus bound for Gangjin.<br>\n\n<br>From Gangjin Bus Terminal, Walk about 400 m following\nthe signs for Birthplace of Yeongnang.\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-02-1659446456971","title":"Birthplace of Yeongnang (강진영랑생가)","description":"Kim Yun-sik was born on this site on January 16, 1903 as the first-born of two sons and three daughters.
