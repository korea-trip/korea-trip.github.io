In addition to the gorgeous scenery, a major draw is the great seafood like fresh mullets, long-legged octopuses, small shrimps, and other local specialties said to provide strength during the sweltering summer heat. Since the beach has not yet been discovered by many tourists, visitors will be able to have a calm and relaxing time. The nearby coastal road is a perfect driving course with a stunning view of the sunset.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|expagerange:|Open to visitors of all ages|\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-61-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-61-320-1784|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Shower booth, swimming pool, hut, main stage, benches, drinking fountain|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-01-1659368778986/1608116_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659368778986/1608116_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659368778986/1608117_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659368778986/1608117_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659368778986/1608118_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659368778986/1608118_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659368778986/1608119_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659368778986/1608119_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659368778986/1608120_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659368778986/1608120_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659368778986/190579_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659368778986/190579_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-61-320-1784](tel:+82613201784)\n- [🏠www.hampyeong.go.kr](http://www.hampyeong.go.kr/tour/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.1404695621\nlongitude: 126.3901517263\ntitle: 2108, Wolcheon-ri, Hampyeong-gun, Jeollanam-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-01-1659368778986","title":"Anak Beach (안악해수욕장)","description":"Anak Beach is a white sand beach that stretches for more than 200 meters and is bordered by a forest of pine trees.
