During the Byeonginyangyo (the French invasion in 1866), the French fleet stayed in Ganghwado for about a month until they withdrew their forces after losing during the Jeongjoksanseong Battle. During the Sinmiyangyo (the United States expedition to Korea in 1981), the American fleet attacked Chojijin Fortress, Deokjinjin Fortress and Gwangseongbo Fortress. Hence, Ganghwado played a big part in South Korea opening its doors to the West in the 19th century. Ganghwado also became the Western Christian missionaries' center of activity for their missionary works.<br><br>There are three remaining churches that were built in that time that were  influenced or built by the Western Christian Missionaries  Ganghwa Anglican Church established in 1900, Ganghwa St. Andrew's Church established in 1906, and Ganghwa Seodo Central Church established in 1923. <br><br>Ganghwa Seodo Central Church started contruction in February 1923 and was completed as a Korean-architecture chapel in July 1923. The original name was Jumun Church and it was renamed as Seodo Central (Jungang) Church in 1978. The church belongs to The Korean Methodist Church.<br><br>Even though the building of the church doesn't reflect outstanding building techniques and aesthetic qualities, a Western church with a Korean-style wooden structure such as Ganghwa Seodo Central Church is still worth a visit.","regDate":"2022-08-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Holy Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-08-13-1660387217022"},{"id":"2022-08-13-1660368996299","title":"Ganghwa Gyodongdo Island (ÍµêÎèôÎèÑ(Í∞ïÌôî))","description":"Gyodongdo Island is located northwest of the larger Ganghwado Island, and was made more accessible with the opening of Gyodongdaegyo Bridge in July 2014. The name changed with different dynasties, being Gomokgeunhyeon during the Goguryeo Era and Gyodonghyeon under the reign of Silla King Gyeongdeok. The island served as an important stopover point for ambassadors and envoys heading to China. Popular attractions on the island now include Daeryong Market, an alleyway market decorated with colorful murals and statues, and Manghyangdae Memorial, a gathering place for refugees who fled from the nearby Hwanghaedo Island during the Korean War. Many of the houses on Gyodongdo Island have swallow nests under the eaves. The refugees consider the swallows as guests from their hometowns. As such, the island is home to the peace & reunion themed Gyodong Swallow House, Peace Trail, and Gyodong Studio. Gyodong Swallow House serves as an exhibition and performance space. The Peace Trail is a biking path around the island. At Gyodong Studio, visitors can put on old school uniforms and take black-and-white photographs.","regDate":"2022-08-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-13-1660368996299/1890654_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-08-13-1660368996299"},{"id":"2022-08-13-1660357888699","title":"Baemikkumi Sculpture Park (Î∞∞ÎØ∏Íæ∏ÎØ∏Ï°∞Í∞ÅÍ≥µÏõê)","description":"Baemikkumi Sculpture Park rests on Modo Island, one of the nearest islets to Yeongjongdo Island where Incheon International Airport is located.<br><br>The name 'baemikkumi' comes from the local dialect, as people say the island resembles the shape of a hole normally seen from the bottom of a ship as 'baemit' translates to the bilge, and 'kkumi' is most closely translated to mean 'a hole' in English. <br><br>The entire island has now become a beautiful exhibition hall of art works thanks to sculptor Lee Il-ho, who originally started and donated his talents for visitors coming to the island.

This fish was related to the family of fish commonly called drums, croakers, or hardheads for the repetitive throbbing or drumming sounds they make. When the economy flourished thanks to profitable fishing, the Socheongdo port was congested with fishing boats, so much that it was said that one could cross from one island to the next by walking over boats. The species of fish is depleted, and the island remains as quiet with views of North Korea.<br><br>In November 2010, Socheongdo Island was hit by the fatal shelling from North Korea that killed two civilians and two soldiers. In recent months, the island has made an attempt to recover its tourism industry and to develop security tourism by blending its newer military presence at tourist attractions.","regDate":"2022-08-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-12-1660340265213/1385383_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-08-12-1660340265213"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
