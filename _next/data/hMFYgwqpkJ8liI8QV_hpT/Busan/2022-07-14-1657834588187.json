It was formed after the independence of Korea (August 15) as a residential area in the empty place where the previous Gukje Market was demolished. Book stores began opening one-by-one and soon the street became known as Bosu-dong Book Street. The street is popular amongst booklovers for their used books as well as new books, and amongst travelers for the street‚Äôs unique atmosphere. Many young adults also frequent the street because there are many specialty shops for comic books. Every year, the Bosu-dong Culture Festival takes place and visitors can participate in events such as, make-your-own book cover, make-your-own book, and so on. The festival not only gives an opportunity to learn about the history of Bosu-dong Book Street, but have a good time as well. <br>","regDate":"2022-07-15","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Busan","Culture/Art/History","Industrial Sites","Others"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-15-1657890753285/2559054_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Busan/2022-07-15-1657890753285"},{"id":"2022-07-15-1657864539142","title":"BIFF Square (BIFF Í¥ëÏû• (Íµ¨, PIFF Í¥ëÏû•))","description":"Busan‚Äôs modern movie district was originally little more than a pair of cinemas that were built following Korea‚Äôs liberation from Japanese colonial rule over half a century ago. However, major renovations took place ahead of the first Busan International Film Festival (BIFF), and the newly transformed district was named BIFF Square on August 14, 1996.<br><br> Having been remade into a&nbsp;cultural tourist attraction promoting the advancement of Korea‚Äôs film industry, BIFF Square has contributed to Busan‚Äôs newfound status as an international cultural tourist city. The 428 meter-long street stretching from the Buyeong Theater in Nampo-dong to the overpass in Chungmu-dong was divided into ‚ÄúStar Street‚Äù and ‚ÄúFestival Street,‚Äù and on the eve of the festival each year the ‚ÄúBIFF Square Ground Opening‚Äù is held on the street. During the ceremony, events such as the hand printing of famous movie celebrities and Nunggot Jeomdeung (snow-flower lighting) take place. A district such as BIFF Square, crowded with first-run theaters in a city is rare not only in Asia but Europe as well, and for this reason it holds great potential. In recent years, the square has grown into a more complex area, featuring not only movie theaters but also shops and leisure facilities, attracting growing numbers of young visitors and tourists.","regDate":"2022-07-15","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Busan","Culture/Art/History","Experience Programs","Cultural Districts"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-15-1657864539142/2364283_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Busan/2022-07-15-1657864539142"},{"id":"2022-07-15-1657860472029","title":"Amnam Park (Î∂ÄÏÇ∞ ÏïîÎÇ®Í≥µÏõê)","description":"The magnificent cliffs and tree-lined seaside views of Amnam Park bring the harmony of the bluish-green waters and the forested landscape together. Originally a protected area, entrance was not permitted until its opening to the public in 1996, when visitors could first experience the untouched landscape. Now, visitors can fish, explore the observatory, and enjoy the walking path and the elevated bridge. The abundunt pine trees along the walking path make for a pleasant stroll while the path up to the observatory offers great views. If it is fishing that you want, here you can fish on the ocean as well as off the fantastically shaped rocks.  There is also a famous road to go for a drive, leading from Songdo Beach to Amnam Park. This drive takes approximately 5 minutes, but it takes about 20 minutes on foot.","regDate":"2022-07-15","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Busan","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-15-1657860472029/1919826_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Busan/2022-07-15-1657860472029"},{"id":"2022-07-15-1657854261522","title":"75 Square (75Í¥ëÏû•)","description":"A small plaza projecting toward the southern coast of Jeoryeongdo Island, 75 Square is one of the eight scenic sites of Yeongdo-gu in Busan.
