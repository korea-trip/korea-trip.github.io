At the base of this cliff is the Jisatgae Coast along with the imposing stone pillars. Jusangjeolli are stone pillars piled up along the coast and is a designated cultural monument of Jeju Island. Jusangjeolli Cliff was formed when the lava from Hallasan Mountain erupted into the sea of Jungmun. They are rock pillars shaped like cubes or hexagons of various sizes and almost seem as if stone masons had carved them out. The administration of the district named them 'Jisatgae Rocks' from their old name 'Jisatgae'. The 20m cliff makes it a popular spot for high tide and sea angling. The waves of the high tide crashing into the side of the cliff provide a breathtaking view of the ocean surrounding the pillars.","regDate":"2022-07-19","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-19-1658238893407/197693_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2022-07-19-1658238893407"},{"id":"2022-07-19-1658236093306","title":"Daejeonghyanggyo Confucian School (ÎåÄÏ†ïÌñ•Íµê)","description":"Daejeonghyanggyo was a Confucian school during Joseon Dynasty.
