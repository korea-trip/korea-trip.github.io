Jusangjeolli Cliff was formed when the lava from Hallasan Mountain erupted into the sea of Jungmun. They are rock pillars shaped like cubes or hexagons of various sizes and almost seem as if stone masons had carved them out. The administration of the district named them 'Jisatgae Rocks' from their old name 'Jisatgae'. The 20m cliff makes it a popular spot for high tide and sea angling.
