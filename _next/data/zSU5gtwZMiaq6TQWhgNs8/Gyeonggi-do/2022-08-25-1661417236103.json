The king and queen are enshrined separately. The tomb on the left is King Sejo‚Äôs and the one on the right is Queen Jeonhui‚Äôs with a pavilion standing between the two tombs. Requested by King Sejo on his will, the simple design of the tomb and the surrounding compare to the past tombs saved cost and manpower required to finish the work, which became the model for future royal tomb design. Gwangneung is surrounded by forests where an abundance of wild plants grow. It is famous for being the habitat of the Korean redheaded woodpecker (Natural Monument No. 11).\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-31-527-7105|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|Mondays|\n|usetime:|November-January 09:00-17:30<BR>February-May, September-October 09:00-18:00<br>June-August 09:00-18:30<br>* Last admission is 1 hour before closing.|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Gwangneung Historical Museum, mineral spring, drinking fountain, benches, etc.|\n|Admission Fees:|[General admission]<br /> Individuals: Adults 1,000 won / Children & Teenagers 500 won<br /> Groups: Adults 800 won / Children & Teenagers 400 won<br /> <br />  * Groups: 10 or more people <br />* Adults (ages 19-64) / Children & Teenagers (ages 7-18) <br />* Free admission: Preschoolers (ages 6 & under) and senior citizens (ages 65 & over)<br />* ID must be presented at the ticket box. <br /> <br />[Other passes]<br />Hourly pass: 30,000 won<br />* Viewing hours 12:00-13:00 <br />* Valid for 1 year <br /><br />Lunch pass: 3,000 won<br />* Viewing hours12:00-14:00 (last admission is at 13:00)<br />* Limited to 10 times <br /><br />Monthly pass: 10,000 won<br /> * Visitors may enter freely within operating hours<br />* Valid for 1 month<br /><br /> [Free entry]<br /> * All visitors on the last Wednesday of each month (Culture Day). <br /> * Visitors wearing hanbok.|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Unavailable|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-25-1661417236103/2364478_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-25-1661417236103/2364478_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-25-1661417236103/2364480_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-25-1661417236103/2364480_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-25-1661417236103/2364481_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-25-1661417236103/2364481_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-31-527-7105](tel:+82315277105)\n- [üè†royaltombs.cha.go.kr](http://royaltombs.cha.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.7528333807\nlongitude: 127.1767420667\ntitle: 354, Gwangneungsumogwon-ro, Namyangju-si, Gyeonggi-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nCheongnyangni Station (Seoul Subway Line 1), Exit 4. <br>\nTake Bus No. 707 and get off at Gwangneungnae Terminal Bus Stop.<br> Transfer to Bus No. 21 and get off at Gwangneung Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-25-1661417236103","title":"Gwangneung Royal Tomb [UNESCO World Heritage] (ÎÇ®ÏñëÏ£º Í¥ëÎ¶â(ÏÑ∏Ï°∞, Ï†ïÌù¨ÏôïÌõÑ) [Ïú†ÎÑ§Ïä§ÏΩî ÏÑ∏Í≥ÑÎ¨∏ÌôîÏú†ÏÇ∞])","description":"Gwangneung, located in Namyangju in Gyeonggi-do is the royal tomb of King Sejo (1417-1468, reign 1455-1468) and Queen Jeonghui (1418-1483).

Gaeseong, Suwon, Ganghwa and Gwangju are located in the north, south, west, and east direction respectively. Namhansanseong Fortress is located to the east in Gwangju. The park is situated on Namhansan Mountain, 24km southeast from Seoul and 6km northeast from Seongnam. The length of trails is a total of approximately 12.4 km (main fortress 8.9km, external fortress 3.2km, Sinnamsanseong Fortress 0.2km). The x_height is 7.3m.<br><br>The fortress is alternately recorded as being the royal fortress of King Onjo of the Baekje Kingdom, whose father was King Dongmyeong during Goguryeo period or a fortress built in 673 during the reign of King Munmu (the 13th year) of Silla period during the heat of the Silla and Tang War. The old site was rebuilt several times, with its current style of construction being built in 1621 during King Gwanghae‚Äôs reign. <br><br> Namhansanseong‚Äôs circumference is approximately 12km, stacking small natural stones over big stones. The fortress includes Sueocheong (Namhansan Mountain Fortress Defense Command), Gwana (government office), storage, and a haenggung (temporary palace), as well as 80 wells and 45 springs. Also, administration was moved from Gwangju-eup to inside of the fortress, clearly showing the importance of Namhansanseong Fortress in that period. 12,700 people participated in a field exercise carried out for the first time after building the fortress by command of King Injo (17th year, 1639). These days, only a few buildings remain inside of the fortress including East and South Gate, Seojangdae, Hyeonjeolsa Temple, Yeonmu Hall, Janggyeongsa Temple, Jisudang, Yeongwoljeong, and Chimgwaejeong. Among these remaining buildings, four gates, Sueojangdae, and some parts of the fortress in the middle of West Gate still maintain their original forms. Namhansanseong Fortress is designated as Historical Site No. 57 and a provincial park.","regDate":"2022-09-01","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Provincial Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-01-1662018070165/1589317_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-09-01-1662018070165"},{"id":"2022-09-01-1662015399315","title":"Myeongseongsan Mountain (Î™ÖÏÑ±ÏÇ∞)","description":"Situated on the border between Cheorwon (Gangwon-do) and Pocheon (Gyeonggi-do), Myeongseongsan Mountain is renowned for its beautiful fall foliage and fields of silver grass.
