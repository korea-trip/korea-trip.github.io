The original buildings of the government complex were all burned to the ground in 1434 and rebuilt shortly afterward, with continual work done throughout the Joseon period.

The tunnel has a spectacular and mystical beauty with countless stalactites and stalagmites, as well as stalactite columns. The particularly thin stalactites and stalactic columns in this cave are well-known for their uniqueness and beauty. Although this is a relatively small lava tunnel, its exotic colors and the richness of the secondary topological formations make it extraordinary in terms of research value.
