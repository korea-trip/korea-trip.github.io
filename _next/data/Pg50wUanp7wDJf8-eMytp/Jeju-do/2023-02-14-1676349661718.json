The length of the island is 3.8 kilometers and the circumference is 17 kilometers. People have lived in Udo Island since the Joseon period, with most living as a farmer or working in the fishing industry. The island boasts fertile soil, abundant schools of fish, and scenic sights; local heritages (female divers, stone walls, and stone tombs) as well as natural attractions abound on the island, making it a miniature of Jeju Island. The island is also full of amenities and tourism outlets  fishing, bike trails, sand massages, submarine tours and cruises. At the highest point of the island, Udobong Peak (alt. 132 meters), visitors can see a panoramic view of the island as well as Seongsan Ilchulbong Tuff Cone and the main island. Rhodolith Beach (a white beach designated Natural Monument) has appeared regularly in films and TV commercials thanks to its breathtaking white sand and emerald sea. The sea around the beach showcases different colors depending on the water level. This makes Rhodolith Beach one of the most popular tourist attractions in Jeju-do, along with Hallasan Mountain. To protect the exquisite nature and promote maritime tourism, Bukjeju County designated two ports on the island (Udo Port and Haumokdong Port) and the sea surrounding it (25,863 ㎢) as Udo Maritime Park in January 2001. Visitors can appreciate maritime tourism at its best including a trip under the sea by submarine.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br> • Jeju Travel Hotline: +82-64-740-6000|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Film Locations:|Movie \"Little Mermaid (2004)\"|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-02-14-1676349661718/2364394_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-14-1676349661718/2364394_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-14-1676349661718/2364395_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-14-1676349661718/2364395_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-14-1676349661718/2364397_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-14-1676349661718/2364397_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-14-1676349661718/2364398_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-14-1676349661718/2364398_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-14-1676349661718/2364399_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-14-1676349661718/2364399_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-14-1676349661718/2654835_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-14-1676349661718/2654835_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-64-740-6000](tel:+82647406000)\n- [🏠https://www.visitjeju.net/kr/detail/view?contentsid=CONT_000000000500477\"title=\"새창: 비짓제주\"target=\"_blank\"><br>www.visitjeju.net](<br>https://www.visitjeju.net/kr/detail/view?contentsid=CONT_000000000500477)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.5065059625\nlongitude: 126.9533995648\ntitle: 153, Udo-ro, Jeju-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2023-02-14-1676349661718","title":"Udo Island - Udo Maritime Park (우도(해양도립공원))","description":"Situated 3.8 kilometers off the northeast coast of Jeju Island, Udo Island was named because it resembles a lying cow.

With no entrance as such, the cave is not open to the general public and thus its original form remains preserved to this day, giving it a high geological value. <Br><Br> Although the Dangcheomuldonggul Cave is technically a lava tube, it resembles a limestone cave due to the secondary geological formations of lime substances that have accumulated in the ground above the tube. The tunnel has a spectacular and mystical beauty with countless stalactites and stalagmites, as well as stalactite columns. The particularly thin stalactites and stalactic columns in this cave are well-known for their uniqueness and beauty. Although this is a relatively small lava tunnel, its exotic colors and the richness of the secondary topological formations make it extraordinary in terms of research value.
