Yeongsil Trail is known as the best autumn foliage course on Hallasan Mountain. Yeongsil Course is 3.7 kilometers and takes approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes. It starts from Yeongsil Rest Area and follows a relatively gentle slope lined with beautiful trees and autumn foliage for about one kilometer.<br> After that, an uphill path emerges along steep mountain ridges. The deep Yeongsilgyegok Valley and vast rock walls could be the result of a large volcano entrance in the past. After passing Byeongpungbawi Rock, the path becomes relatively flat until Witsaeoruem Rest Area. The first attraction of Yeongsil is a group of volcanic rocks collectively called Yeongsilgiam. These oddly shaped rocks are situated to the right of a big valley at 1,400 meters to 1,600 meters above sea level, soaring upwards towards the sky. Pass by Sajebi Hill to get a glass of mineral spring water, and  reach Eorimok to take the path downwards.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-64-713-9950~1,<br>+82-64-747-9950|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|[Ascent]<br> November-February 06:00-12:00 <br>March-April & September-October 05:30-14:30 <br>May-August 05:00-15:00<br>[Descent]<br>Witsaeoreum Volcanic Cone: November-February 15:00 / March-April & September-October 16:00 / May-August 17:00<br>Dongneung Peak: November-February 13:30 / March-April & September-October 14:00 / May-August 14:30<br>Nambyeok divide: November-February 14:00 / Spring, Fall 14:30 / May-August 15:00<br>* Hiking strictly limited to designated trail|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Available Facilities:|Trail information center, mountain museum, convenience store, etc. |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-02-14-1676364076313/2617905_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-14-1676364076313/2617905_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-14-1676364076313/2617906_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-14-1676364076313/2617906_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-14-1676364076313/2617907_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-14-1676364076313/2617907_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-14-1676364076313/2617908_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-14-1676364076313/2617908_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-64-713-9950](tel:+82647139950)\n- [üè†www.jeju.go.kr/hallasan</a> <br><a href=\"https://visitjeju.net/kr/#\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"ÏÉàÏ∞Ω : ÎπÑÏßìÏ†úÏ£º ÌôàÌéòÏù¥ÏßÄÎ°ú Ïù¥Îèô\">visitjeju.net](https://www.jeju.go.kr/hallasan/index.htm)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.3402306397\nlongitude: 126.4803110551\ntitle: 246, Yeongsil-ro, Seogwipo-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2023-02-14-1676364076313","title":"Yeongsil Trail (Hallasan National Park) (ÌïúÎùºÏÇ∞ ÏòÅÏã§)","description":"Hallasan Mountain has five trails excluding Donnaeko Course that is closed for nature preservation.

With no entrance as such, the cave is not open to the general public and thus its original form remains preserved to this day, giving it a high geological value. <Br><Br> Although the Dangcheomuldonggul Cave is technically a lava tube, it resembles a limestone cave due to the secondary geological formations of lime substances that have accumulated in the ground above the tube. The tunnel has a spectacular and mystical beauty with countless stalactites and stalagmites, as well as stalactite columns. The particularly thin stalactites and stalactic columns in this cave are well-known for their uniqueness and beauty. Although this is a relatively small lava tunnel, its exotic colors and the richness of the secondary topological formations make it extraordinary in terms of research value. This cave has been designated natural monument.<Br><Br>* The UNESCO World Heritage inscribed Geomun Oreum Lava Tube System consists of Bengdwigul, Manjanggul Cave, Gimnyeonggul, Yongcheondonggul and Dangcheomuldonggul Caves.","regDate":"2023-02-15","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-15-1676450494241"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
