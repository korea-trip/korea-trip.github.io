{"pageProps":{"content":"![Sokcho Lighthouse Observatory (속초등대전망대)](/2022-10-13-1665647612612/2711170_image2_1.webp)\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> It is No. 1 of Sokcho’s Eight Sights. This white lighthouse creates a picturesque view along with the surrounding blue sea. Sokcho Lighthouse Observatory was originally just a lighthouse, but now, it is opened to the public and plays a role of an observatory. Walking up along the wooden deck trail among the bamboo grove leads you to the observatory, which offers an open view of the deep blue East Sea, the Cheongchoho Lake, which is home to migratory birds, and the magnificent scenery of Seoraksan Mountain. Viewed from the high tower, the East Sea unfolds its boundless ocean and sometimes it looks like a calm lake but can become an energetic ocean full of vitality. Built in 1957, Sokcho Lighthouse still lights up for ships at night. The bright light and sound of the beacon, which has been in service since the lighthouse’s establishment, can show the waterway to a boat, which is about 35 km away from the lighthouse. Right next to the observatory, Yeonggeumjeong Pavilion is situated.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-33-633-3406|\n|parking:|Available (10 spaces)|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Summer season (April–October) 06:00–20:00<br />Winter season (November–March) 07:00–18:00<br />Exhibition Hall & Observatory 09:00–18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Activity Fees:|Free of charge|\n|Available Facilities:|Observatory|\n|Parking Fees:|Free of charge|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|None|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-10-13-1665647612612/182603_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-13-1665647612612/182603_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-13-1665647612612/676940_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-13-1665647612612/676940_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-13-1665647612612/677047_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-13-1665647612612/677047_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-13-1665647612612/677054_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-13-1665647612612/677054_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-13-1665647612612/2711171_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-13-1665647612612/2711171_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-13-1665647612612/2711172_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-13-1665647612612/2711172_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-33-633-3406](tel:+82336333406)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 38.2137204042\nlongitude: 128.6000930800\ntitle: 8-28, Yeonggeumjeong-ro 5-gil, Sokcho-si, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Express/Intercity Bus]<br>\nTake a bus from Dong Seoul Bus Terminal to Sokcho Express Bus Terminal.<br><br>\n\n[Bus]<br>\nGet off at Yeonggeumjeong Entrance Bus Stop.<br>\nBus No. 1, 1-1, 3, 3-1, 7, 9, 9-1, 9-2, 13-1, 13-2, 15, 16, 18, 19, 22<br>\nApprox. 5min-walk to the lighthouse\n","data":{"id":"2022-10-13-1665647612612","title":"Sokcho Lighthouse Observatory (속초등대전망대)","description":"It is No. 1 of Sokcho’s Eight Sights.

The peak is made of strange rocks stretching from the foot of the mountain to the top at 900 m above sea level. The peak consists of six rocks, which create a majestic view of the rocky peak. The peak with the circumference of 4 km forms a great panoramic view along with Daecheongbong Peak and Outer Seorak. Ulsan Peak presents an imposing scene, and it was visited by many famous poets and calligraphers including Choe Yeon and Heo Jeok during the Joseon period who left behind their records. In addition, several legends are associated with Ulsan Peak. One day, a heavenly god commanded peaks of all mountains to assemble at Geumgangsan Mountain to create the greatest scenery. However, the Ulsan Peak was too heavy, so it was late for the meeting. Feeling ashamed, it didn’t go back home (Ulsan) directly, and took a rest at Seoraksan Mountain, but stayed there forever. Also, there is a saying that the peak was named after the shape of the rock, which resembles a fence (ul+tari) or a crying (ul) mountain (san). Visitors can get to the Ulsan Peak by starting from the small park and passing through Sinheungsa Temple and Heundeul Rock. At the beginning of the path, it starts with a gentle slope, but after the Heundeul Rock, there are a steep rocky hill and the iron stairs. It requires about 4 hr for getting to and from the peak. It is hard for the elderly or children to climb because of high level of difficulty.","regDate":"2022-10-16","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Resources","Rocks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-16-1665913620696/2711195_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-16-1665913620696"},{"id":"2022-10-16-1665910327005","title":"Uisangdae Pavilion (낙산사 의상대)","description":"This pavilion is located on a seaside cliff on the way from Yangyang’s Naksansa Temple to Gwaneumgul Cave of Hongnyeonam Hermitage. The word “dae” in Uisangdae refers to a building built at a vantage point for areas with beautiful scenery. Indeed, the view of the East Sea and the coast from Uisangdae Pavilion awarded its recognition as one of the Eight Sights of Yangyang, and a must-visit place for all visitors to Naksansa Temple. Jeong Cheol (pen-name  Songgang), a famed scholar and writer of the poem Song of Diamond Mountains, chose the pavilion as one of the Eight Sights of Gwandong, and the pavilion is today one of the popular sites for sunrise-viewing on the east coast of Korea. Together with Hongnyeonam Hermitage, it is designated as the Scenic Site No. 27 of Korea under the name “Uisangdae Pavilion and Hongnyeonam Hermitage of Naksansa Temple, Yangyang.” Uisangdae is named after Uisang, a respected Silla-era Buddhist monk who is said to have founded this temple in 671 (11th year of King Munmu’s reign of Silla), and many stories of his deeds can still be found in the temple. For instance, Uisangdae is said to be the site where he meditated before founding Naksansa Temple at its present site. Today’s pavilion was restored to its present hexagonal form in 1995.","regDate":"2022-10-16","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-16-1665910327005/2711338_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-16-1665910327005"},{"id":"2022-10-16-1665906295356","title":"Uiamho Lake Skywalk (의암호 스카이워크)","description":"Uiamho Lake Skywalk, one of the two largest skywalks in Chuncheon along with Soyanggang Skywalk, is located on Uiamho Bike Path between Kim Youjeong Memorial Stone and Chuncheon Songam Sports Town in the Uiam Lakeside. Connecting with the water bridge section of the bike path, Uiamho Lake Skywalk consists of a 10 m-long straight section and a 10 m-diameter circular section, located 12 m above the water. The entire floor is made of transparent glass, so visitors will feel like walking on the water. When you stand on the skywalk, you will encounter a picturesque view of Samaksan Mountain and Uiamho Lake. Soyanggang Skywalk boasts another splendid scenery of Chuncheon. Although the access from the Kim Youjeong Memorial Stone is close to Uiam Lake Skywalk, parking space is insufficient, thus, it is recommended to use the public parking lot near Chuncheon Songam Sports Town. It takes 15 min by foot or bike along the Uiamho Bike Path from the public parking lot to Uiam Lake Skywalk. It is a great place for a stroll amid the magnificent landscape.","regDate":"2022-10-16","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Culture/Art/History","Architectural Sights","Monuments/Observatories"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-16-1665906295356/2605228_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-16-1665906295356"},{"id":"2022-10-16-1665903453154","title":"Ttansan Mountain (딴산)","description":"Located just four kilometers away from Hwacheon-eup, Ttansan Mountain is nestled between Paroho Lake and the entrance to Peace Dam, making it appear more like an island floating on the water rather than a mountain. <br>This small island-like mountain offers an interesting and unique setting and the nearby mountains provide a cooling effect with its shadows on the water creating a relaxing resting area.","regDate":"2022-10-16","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-16-1665903453154/2020509_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-16-1665903453154"},{"id":"2022-10-16-1665900040878","title":"The Literary Village of Kim You Jeong (김유정문학촌)","description":"The Literary Village of Kim You Jeong was established on the site of the birth home of Kim, in order to commemorate Kim You-jeong who left various great short story novels of Korea’s modern times, such as Spring, Spring (1935), and Camellia Flower (1936). It was opened in 2002, consisting of the Birth Home of Kim You-jeong, Memorial Hall, foot-operated mortar, etc. Then, in 2016, various facilities, such as Kim You-jeong’s Story House, outdoor stage, experience room, and Nangman Nuri were additionally built across the Literary Village of Kim You-jeong. The current birth home with the square-shaped structure, which is the typical hanok (traditional Korean house) style, was restored according to historical research by Kim’s relatives and students. The Memorial Hall provides information and displays artifacts related to Kim You-jeong’s life and works. Kim You-jeong’s Story House shows three-dimensional exhibits and videos related to his works and life. Various sculptures made with the themes of Kim’s short story novels are placed throughout its outside area. It is recommended to walk along the Sille Story Road after visiting the Literary Village.
