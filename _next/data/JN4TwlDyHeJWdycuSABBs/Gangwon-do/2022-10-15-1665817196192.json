The peak is made of strange rocks stretching from the foot of the mountain to the top at 900 m above sea level. The peak consists of six rocks, which create a majestic view of the rocky peak. The peak with the circumference of 4 km forms a great panoramic view along with Daecheongbong Peak and Outer Seorak. Ulsan Peak presents an imposing scene, and it was visited by many famous poets and calligraphers including Choe Yeon and Heo Jeok during the Joseon period who left behind their records. In addition, several legends are associated with Ulsan Peak. One day, a heavenly god commanded peaks of all mountains to assemble at Geumgangsan Mountain to create the greatest scenery. However, the Ulsan Peak was too heavy, so it was late for the meeting. Feeling ashamed, it didn‚Äôt go back home (Ulsan) directly, and took a rest at Seoraksan Mountain, but stayed there forever. Also, there is a saying that the peak was named after the shape of the rock, which resembles a fence (ul+tari) or a crying (ul) mountain (san). Visitors can get to the Ulsan Peak by starting from the small park and passing through Sinheungsa Temple and Heundeul Rock. At the beginning of the path, it starts with a gentle slope, but after the Heundeul Rock, there are a steep rocky hill and the iron stairs. It requires about 4 hr for getting to and from the peak. It is hard for the elderly or children to climb because of high level of difficulty.","regDate":"2022-10-16","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Resources","Rocks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-16-1665913620696/2711195_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-16-1665913620696"},{"id":"2022-10-16-1665910327005","title":"Uisangdae Pavilion (ÎÇôÏÇ∞ÏÇ¨ ÏùòÏÉÅÎåÄ)","description":"This pavilion is located on a seaside cliff on the way from Yangyang‚Äôs Naksansa Temple to Gwaneumgul Cave of Hongnyeonam Hermitage. The word ‚Äúdae‚Äù in Uisangdae refers to a building built at a vantage point for areas with beautiful scenery. Indeed, the view of the East Sea and the coast from Uisangdae Pavilion awarded its recognition as one of the Eight Sights of Yangyang, and a must-visit place for all visitors to Naksansa Temple. Jeong Cheol (pen-name  Songgang), a famed scholar and writer of the poem Song of Diamond Mountains, chose the pavilion as one of the Eight Sights of Gwandong, and the pavilion is today one of the popular sites for sunrise-viewing on the east coast of Korea. Together with Hongnyeonam Hermitage, it is designated as the Scenic Site No. 27 of Korea under the name ‚ÄúUisangdae Pavilion and Hongnyeonam Hermitage of Naksansa Temple, Yangyang.‚Äù Uisangdae is named after Uisang, a respected Silla-era Buddhist monk who is said to have founded this temple in 671 (11th year of King Munmu‚Äôs reign of Silla), and many stories of his deeds can still be found in the temple. For instance, Uisangdae is said to be the site where he meditated before founding Naksansa Temple at its present site. Today‚Äôs pavilion was restored to its present hexagonal form in 1995.","regDate":"2022-10-16","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-16-1665910327005/2711338_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-16-1665910327005"},{"id":"2022-10-16-1665906295356","title":"Uiamho Lake Skywalk (ÏùòÏïîÌò∏ Ïä§Ïπ¥Ïù¥ÏõåÌÅ¨)","description":"Uiamho Lake Skywalk, one of the two largest skywalks in Chuncheon along with Soyanggang Skywalk, is located on Uiamho Bike Path between Kim Youjeong Memorial Stone and Chuncheon Songam Sports Town in the Uiam Lakeside. Connecting with the water bridge section of the bike path, Uiamho Lake Skywalk consists of a 10 m-long straight section and a 10 m-diameter circular section, located 12 m above the water. The entire floor is made of transparent glass, so visitors will feel like walking on the water. When you stand on the skywalk, you will encounter a picturesque view of Samaksan Mountain and Uiamho Lake. Soyanggang Skywalk boasts another splendid scenery of Chuncheon. Although the access from the Kim Youjeong Memorial Stone is close to Uiam Lake Skywalk, parking space is insufficient, thus, it is recommended to use the public parking lot near Chuncheon Songam Sports Town. It takes 15 min by foot or bike along the Uiamho Bike Path from the public parking lot to Uiam Lake Skywalk. It is a great place for a stroll amid the magnificent landscape.","regDate":"2022-10-16","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Culture/Art/History","Architectural Sights","Monuments/Observatories"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-16-1665906295356/2605228_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-16-1665906295356"},{"id":"2022-10-16-1665903453154","title":"Ttansan Mountain (Îî¥ÏÇ∞)","description":"Located just four kilometers away from Hwacheon-eup, Ttansan Mountain is nestled between Paroho Lake and the entrance to Peace Dam, making it appear more like an island floating on the water rather than a mountain. <br>This small island-like mountain offers an interesting and unique setting and the nearby mountains provide a cooling effect with its shadows on the water creating a relaxing resting area.","regDate":"2022-10-16","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-16-1665903453154/2020509_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-16-1665903453154"},{"id":"2022-10-16-1665900040878","title":"The Literary Village of Kim You Jeong (ÍπÄÏú†Ï†ïÎ¨∏ÌïôÏ¥å)","description":"The Literary Village of Kim You Jeong was established on the site of the birth home of Kim, in order to commemorate Kim You-jeong who left various great short story novels of Korea‚Äôs modern times, such as Spring, Spring (1935), and Camellia Flower (1936).
