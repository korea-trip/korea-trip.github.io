The mineral-rich spring  water offers a slew of natural health benefits. The alkaline water found in the natural hot spring contains a  variety of  minerals (about 20 types), including calcium and sodium bicarbonate. <br>\n <br>\n When you bathe in the hot spring, your skin absorbs these minerals, which speed up cellular restoration and blood circulation. An oxygenated circulatory system is beneficial in keeping not only your stomach, but your body's other vital organs and tissues healthy and strong. <br>\n <br> The hot spring offers natural treatment options for various common ailments such as arthritis, neuralgia, high blood pressure, stomach disorder, and stroke. Nestled in the mountains, the spa offers the relaxation of walking in the forest and breathing in the fresh valley air. Also, stopping by the historical statue at Asanho Lake along the west coast highway  to Asanoncheon Hot Spring will add an extra bit of fun to your weekend excursion.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-41-541-5526|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open year round)|\n|usetime:|Sunday-Friday 06:00-20:00<br>Saturday 06:00-21:00<br>(Last admission is one hour before closing)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-28-1658997789555/1599753_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1658997789555/1599753_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1658997789555/1599756_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1658997789555/1599756_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1658997789555/1599757_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1658997789555/1599757_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1658997789555/1599758_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1658997789555/1599758_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-41-541-5526](tel:+82415415526)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.8543644796\nlongitude: 126.9801018004\ntitle: 217-7, Asanoncheon-ro, Asan-si, Chungcheongnam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway + Bus]\n<br>- Onyangoncheon Station (Seoul Subway Line 1, Janghang Line)\n<br>Take city bus 100-1 and get off at Asanoncheon Hot Spring Bus  Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-28-1658997789555","title":"Asanoncheon Hot Spring (아산온천)","description":"Asanoncheon Hot Spring was discovered in 1987 and designated as a tourist zone in 1999.

The wall of the fortress starts from the site where Dongmun (East gate) was located to the area of Geumgang River, made by piling soil up. However, only a few traces remain of its former glory. <br><br>For now, it leaves a blurry trail including a 20 meter area to the east of Cheongsanseong Fortress, Dongmun Bridge from Seokmok-ri, and an area from Pilseobong Peak to Yeomchang-ri. While the outer wall is sharply sloped, the inner wall was built with a gentle slope to make it easier for horses to reach the guard posts on the top of the wall. Inside the fortress, the palace of Baekje, government offices, houses, temples, stores and protected facilities can be seen. The entire structure of Naseong Fortress features Geumgang River in the south and west sides, providing a natural double-defense system. The wall was one of the important outer defense facilities along with Cheongsanseong and Cheongmasanseong Fortresses.<br><br>* Area  554,591 ㎡","regDate":"2022-11-02","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Fortresses"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Chungcheongnam-do/2022-11-02-1667372047028"},{"id":"2022-11-02-1667368710012","title":"Buyeo Muryangsa Temple (무량사(부여))","description":"Muryangsa Temple, located at the foot of Mansusan Mountain in Buyeo-gun, Chungcheongnam-do, is said to have been built during the reign of Silla King Munmu by national preceptor Beomil.
