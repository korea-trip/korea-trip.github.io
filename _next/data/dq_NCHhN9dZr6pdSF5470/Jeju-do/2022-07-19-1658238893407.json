At the base of this cliff is the Jisatgae Coast along with the imposing stone pillars. Jusangjeolli are stone pillars piled up along the coast and is a designated cultural monument of Jeju Island. Jusangjeolli Cliff was formed when the lava from Hallasan Mountain erupted into the sea of Jungmun. They are rock pillars shaped like cubes or hexagons of various sizes and almost seem as if stone masons had carved them out. The administration of the district named them 'Jisatgae Rocks' from their old name 'Jisatgae'. The 20m cliff makes it a popular spot for high tide and sea angling. The waves of the high tide crashing into the side of the cliff provide a breathtaking view of the ocean surrounding the pillars.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-64-738-1521|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|09:00 -18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 2,000 won / Teenagers & Children 1,000 won<br>Groups - Adults 1,600 won / Teenagers & Children 600 won<br><br>* Group: 10 or more people<br>* Free admission: Preschoolers (ages 6 and younger), senior citizens (ages 65 and older)|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Paid parking lot|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Not available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-19-1658238893407/1206885_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658238893407/1206885_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658238893407/1206886_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658238893407/1206886_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658238893407/1206888_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658238893407/1206888_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658238893407/1206889_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658238893407/1206889_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658238893407/1206890_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658238893407/1206890_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658238893407/1206891_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658238893407/1206891_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658238893407/1206893_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658238893407/1206893_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658238893407/1206894_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658238893407/1206894_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658238893407/1206897_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658238893407/1206897_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658238893407/1206898_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658238893407/1206898_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-64-738-1521](tel:+82647381521)\n- [üè†www.visitjeju.net](http://www.visitjeju.net)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.2380021831\nlongitude: 126.4261180463\ntitle: 36-30, Ieodo-ro, Seogwipo-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Jeju International Airport, take Airport Limousine Bus No. 600 and get off at International Convention Center Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-19-1658238893407","title":"Daepo Jusangjeolli Cliff (Ï£ºÏÉÅÏ†àÎ¶¨ÎåÄ(ÎåÄÌè¨ÎèôÏßÄÏÇøÍ∞ú))","description":"If you follow the farm road about 600m to the southwest from Daepo-dong, at the end of the pine tree forest is a cliff.
