Miller purchased the land in 1962 and starting in 1970, many trees were planted in earnest. At that time, the park was only open to experts in related fields and members who helped fund the arboretum. In 2009, select sections of the arboretum were finally opened to the general public. The arboretum features more than 13,200 plants, including holly, magnolia, camelia, and maple trees, as well as five varieties of Rose of Sharon, the national flower.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-41-672-9982|\n|opendate:|1979|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|November-March 09:00-17:00 / April-October 09:00-18:00<BR>Extended operation: Saturdays April 10 - May 22 09:00-19:00 / July 18 - August 15 09:00-19:00 <br>* Last admission 1 hr before closing|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Areas Open to the Public:|Miller Garden|\n|Shopping Information:|Holly Shop, Holly Cafe|\n|Facility Utilization Fees:|Refer to the official website|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Miller Garden, exhibition hall, Garden Stay, etc.|\n|Admission Fees:|March-November: Adults 9,000 won / Teenagers & senior citizens 6,000 won / Children 5,000 won<br>December-February: Adults 6,000 won / Teenagers & senior citizens 5,000 won / Children 4,000 won<br><br> * Adults (ages 19-64) / Children (ages 4-18) / Senior citizens (ages 65 and over) <br> * Group discount: 1,000 won discount for 30 people or more<BR>* Free admission: Preschoolers (ages 3 and under)|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-02-1667378919698/2653795_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-02-1667378919698/2653795_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-02-1667378919698/2653796_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-02-1667378919698/2653796_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-02-1667378919698/2653801_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-02-1667378919698/2653801_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-02-1667378919698/2653803_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-02-1667378919698/2653803_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-02-1667378919698/1649646_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-02-1667378919698/1649646_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-02-1667378919698/2653793_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-02-1667378919698/2653793_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-02-1667378919698/2653794_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-02-1667378919698/2653794_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-02-1667378919698/2653802_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-02-1667378919698/2653802_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-02-1667378919698/2653804_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-02-1667378919698/2653804_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-41-672-9982](tel:+82416729982)\n- [üè†www.chollipo.org](http://www.chollipo.org)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.7943735798\nlongitude: 126.1437513290\ntitle: 187, Cheollipo 1-gil, Taean-gun, Chungcheongnam-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-02-1667378919698","title":"Cheollipo Arboretum (Ï≤úÎ¶¨Ìè¨ÏàòÎ™©Ïõê)","description":"Cheollipo Arboretum is located on the tip of the Taean peninsula, and was founded by Carl Ferris Miller, the blue-eyed Korean.

There are few existing records that mention the temple‚Äôs beginning. Some suggest that it was built around AD 527 during the 5th year of Baekje King Seongwang‚Äôs reign, but there is little evidence to support this theory. The only reference alluding to a specific time is Yeojidoseo (Detailed Survey of Korean Geography published during the late Joseon dynasty). It states Jeongamsa Temples location as on Oseosan Mountain, and Oseosan Mountain being surrounded by Hongsan Mountain and Baegwolsan Mountain and intersected by Hongju, Gyeolseong, and Boryeong. This indicates the temple was recognized in the mid-18th century and around the same time, Garamgo (a book about temples, published in the late 18th century) also states that Jeongamsa Temple is located approximately 11 kilometers to the east of Gyeolseonghyeon. It is still uncertain whether the temple referred to is Jeongamsa Temple on Oseosan Mountain. <br>Some foundation stones within the temple site measure 70-80 centimeters on each side. These stones indicate that the old Buddhist shrine of Jeongamsa Temple was laid out with five <em>kan</em> (Korean unit of measurement indicating the space between two pilars) at the front and three kan on the side. Future archaeological studies will help identify the true history of Jeongamsa Temple.","regDate":"2022-11-20","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Chungcheongnam-do/2022-11-20-1668919580082"},{"id":"2022-11-20-1668916695189","title":"Gongseri Catholic Church (ÏïÑÏÇ∞ Í≥µÏÑ∏Î¶¨ÏÑ±Îãπ)","description":"Gongseri Catholic Church was founded in 1894 as the main parish of the Daejeon diocese in Gongse-ri, Inju-myeon that connects Asanman Bay to Sapgyocheon Stream. Early missionaries originally used a common house for church meetings in the early years until in 1897 when a rectory was built, followed by the establishment of the main church in 1922. This was the first Catholic church in Chungcheongnam-do and the religion spread across Anseong, Onyang, and Dunpo to establish regional churches respectively. The grounds have three graves of prosecuted martyrs, a parish and rectory, retreat house, and meeting room. The premises is surrounded by beautiful views of a lush forest.","regDate":"2022-11-20","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Holy Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-20-1668916695189/2439706_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Chungcheongnam-do/2022-11-20-1668916695189"},{"id":"2022-11-19-1668854405248","title":"Ganggyeong Bugok Methodist Church (Íµ¨ Í∞ïÍ≤ΩÏÑ±Í≤∞ÍµêÌöå ÏòàÎ∞∞Îãπ)","description":"The early form of church architecture was mostly hanok (Korean traditional houses) style as it was the time when missionary activities were just settling.
