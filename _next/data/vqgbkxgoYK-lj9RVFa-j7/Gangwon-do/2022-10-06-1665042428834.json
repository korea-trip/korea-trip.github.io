Naksansa Temple is one of the foremost sights of Yangyang, and one of the most historic sites in the region. Along with Ganghwa‚Äôs Bomunsa Temple and Namhae‚Äôs Boriam Hermitage, it is said to be one of the three centers of the cult of Avalokitesvara in Korea. Its handsome view overlooking the East Sea has earned it a spot in the Eight Sights of Gwandong (eight famous sights in Yeongdong region of Gangwon-do), documented throughout the ages in many classic literature and poetry. Today‚Äôs Naksansa Temple is a product of many restorations and expansions, and has many examples of cultural heritage within its walls. There is a 16 meter-tall statue of the Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva to Uisangdae, a pavilion built to overlook the sunrise over the East Sea on a coastal cliff, Hongnyeonam Hermitage, built over the crashing waves, Seven-story Stone Pagoda of Naksansa Temple, Yangyang (Treasure No. 499), a Joseon-era pagoda with Goryeo-era style, and Stupa, Stele, and Reliquaries of Naksansa Temple, Yangyang (Treasure No. 1723), including a number of sarira. A mountain fire in 2005 resulted in the loss of 20 buildings, including the building that housed its bronze bell (formerly Treasure No. 479 of Korea). The temple also operates templestay programs available through its website.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-33-672-2447~8|\n|opendate:|1953|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|06:00‚Äì19:30 (visitors must exit the complex by 20:30)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Film Locations:|Drama \"Taejo Wang Geon (2000)\"|\n|Admission Fees:| [Entrance to Naksansa Temple&rsquo;s Cultural Heritage]<br> Individual: Adults 4,000 won / Teenagers 1,500 won / Children 1,000 won<br> Group: Adults 3,000 won / Teenagers 1,000 won / Children 700 won<br> |\n|Parking Fees:|4,000 won|\n|Available Facilities:|Uisangdae Pavilion, Naksansa Temple|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Not available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-10-06-1665042428834/2649028_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665042428834/2649028_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-06-1665042428834/2649029_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665042428834/2649029_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-06-1665042428834/2649031_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665042428834/2649031_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-06-1665042428834/2649035_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665042428834/2649035_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-06-1665042428834/2711349_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665042428834/2711349_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-06-1665042428834/2711350_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665042428834/2711350_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-06-1665042428834/2711351_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665042428834/2711351_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-06-1665042428834/2716319_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665042428834/2716319_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-06-1665042428834/2716320_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665042428834/2716320_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-06-1665042428834/2649030_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665042428834/2649030_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-33-672-2447](tel:+82336722447)\n- [üè†www.naksansa.or.kr](http://www.naksansa.or.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 38.1248562734\nlongitude: 128.6273544905\ntitle: 100, Naksansa-ro, Yangyang-gun, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-10-06-1665042428834","title":"Naksansa Temple (ÎÇôÏÇ∞ÏÇ¨)","description":"This ancient temple was built in the 11th year of King Munmu‚Äôs reign of Silla (671) by the Buddhist monk Uisang.

The waters are so pure, the small pebbles and sand lining the bottom of the stream can be seen clearly. There are a number of areas along the stream perfect for relaxing and enjoying some time in nature. Many families visit and enjoy fishing and the pure environment.

Starting at Mureung Rock, a wide sheet of single rock on which hundreds can sit, the valley trail twists and turns as it passes Samhwasa Temple, Haksodae, Ongnyudong, and Seonnyeotang Ravine, all the way to Ssangpokpo and Yongchupokpo Falls, providing breathtaking scenery along the way. Also known as Arcadia, scholars and poets frequented the valley in times past, and the 5,000 square meters of Mureung Rock bears the inscribed names of some of these poets and their work.
