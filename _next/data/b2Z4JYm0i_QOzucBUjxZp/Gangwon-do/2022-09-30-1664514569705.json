With soft sand and shallow waters, it is a popular beach location. In winter, various migratory birds and swans can be seen, as the birds enjoy clean water and food from the field of reeds. Because of its excellent scenery, Kim Il-seong of North Korea and the former South Korean President Rhee Syngman and Vice-president Lee Ki-poong had summer houses here.
