In 1994, the Chungnam Forest Environment Research Institute moved to this area and designated the well-preserved dense forest as Geumgang Recreational Forest, and the Forest Museum opened in October 1997. Geumgang Recreational Forest is different from other recreational forests. Rather than a dense forest with a trail, this forest has a variety of attractions such as the Forest Museum, an arboretum, greenhouse, pond, and wildlife park scattered on well-maintained roads, giving the impression of a city park.","regDate":"2022-07-17","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Sejong","Nature","Natural Sites","Recreational Forests"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-17-1658033865982/1598617_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Sejong/2022-07-17-1658033865982","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Sejong/2022-07-17-1658033865982"},{"id":"2022-07-17-1658031749066","title":"Biamsa Temple - Sejong (ÎπÑÏïîÏÇ¨(ÏÑ∏Ï¢Ö))","description":"The origin of Biamsa Temple is unknown, but the temple's architectural features suggest that it was built during the mid Goryeo dynasty period (918-1392).
