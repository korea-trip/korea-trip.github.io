Janggunsan Mountain, where the temple is located, is small but full of energy. According to Feng Shui, the mountain is a perfect location for a temple because it is shaped like a dragon curled along the Geumgang River. Yeongpyeongsa is a tranquil place that captures the purity of the temple’s Buddhist practice, with fresh air and clean water that offer a habitat for fireflies, crawfish, and black snails. On the way in, visitors are greeted by a multitude of wildflowers vying for their attention  the columbines and the prairie crocuses in spring, the white lotuses in summer, and the Siberian chrysanthemums in autumn.","regDate":"2022-07-17","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Sejong","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-17-1658047338301/1900675_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Sejong/2022-07-17-1658047338301","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Sejong/2022-07-17-1658047338301"},{"id":"2022-07-17-1658043429958","title":"Sejong Lake Park (세종호수공원 일원)","description":"Sejong Lake Park is a large scale man-made park and is one of the major tourism destinations in Sejong-si.

Following this river, there is a red arch-shaped bridge on the right called Bultigyo Bridge. Geumgang Recreational Forest, a large and well-organized forest, is located on the other side of this bridge. In the past, this remote village can only be reached by boat. In 1994, the Chungnam Forest Environment Research Institute moved to this area and designated the well-preserved dense forest as Geumgang Recreational Forest, and the Forest Museum opened in October 1997. Geumgang Recreational Forest is different from other recreational forests. Rather than a dense forest with a trail, this forest has a variety of attractions such as the Forest Museum, an arboretum, greenhouse, pond, and wildlife park scattered on well-maintained roads, giving the impression of a city park.","regDate":"2022-07-17","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Sejong","Nature","Natural Sites","Recreational Forests"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-17-1658033865982/1598617_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Sejong/2022-07-17-1658033865982","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Sejong/2022-07-17-1658033865982"},{"id":"2022-07-17-1658031749066","title":"Biamsa Temple - Sejong (비암사(세종))","description":"The origin of Biamsa Temple is unknown, but the temple's architectural features suggest that it was built during the mid Goryeo dynasty period (918-1392).
