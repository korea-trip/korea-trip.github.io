The word ‚ÄúSamseonghyeol‚Äù means ‚Äúthree clans holes‚Äù, referring to the three ÂìÅ shaped holes in the middle of the forest. Each hole is separated from the other holes by a few meters.<br><br> Legend has it that Samseonghyeol is the place where three demigods, the founding fathers of Tamna (the former name of Jeju), first appeared. They lived by hunting and gathering until&nbsp;they married three princesses from Byeokrangguk, whom came to shore in a wooden box. The three princesses brought with them a calf, pony, and five different seeds that eventually helped to establish agriculture in Jeju.<br><br> Curiously, the three holes are not percolated by rain or snow.  The ancient trees surrounding the holes look as if they are bowing to them, often surprising visitors. It takes just about 30 minutes to look around Samseonghyeol and its vicinity.","regDate":"2023-02-18","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-18-1676698598035/1618334_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-18-1676698598035"},{"id":"2023-02-18-1676695893214","title":"Saeseom Island Saeyeongyo Bridge (ÏÉàÏÑ¨ ÏÉàÏó∞Íµê)","description":"Saeyeongyo Bridge is the longest pedestrian overpass created in the southern-most area of the country.

The maze not only offers a fun activity for you and your friends, but also provides health benefits as the stones emit high levels of far-infrared radiation and the woods (T. occidentalis) produce a large volume of phytoncides. The park, with its variety of trees several decades old, is the perfect place for forest bathing,‚Äù in which people surround themselves with nature (particularly trees) to soak in the natural benefits.<br><br>In addition to the mazes made of trees and stones, visitors are encouraged to check out the maze museum detailing the history of mazes starting from their origin in the 14th century. During the museum tour, visitors may also participate in hands-on activities such as puzzles and games.","regDate":"2023-02-17","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Theme Parks"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-17-1676623242828","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Jeju-do/2023-02-17-1676623242828"},{"id":"2023-02-17-1676619380298","title":"Marine Park (ÎßàÎ¶∞ÌååÌÅ¨)","description":"Located in Hwasun-ri, Seogwipo-si, Marine Park is the first and only national dolphin experience site.
