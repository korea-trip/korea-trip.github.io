The 16-kilometer valley stretching from Uitan of Macheon-myeon to Cheonwangbong Peak is characterized by very tough topography but beautiful scenery and is the only remaining primeval forest of Jirisan Mountain. It is also dotted with seven waterfalls and 33 ponds. The hike becomes more difficult as the trail enters the valley. Because the valley has taken many lives, some people call it The Valley of Death. For that reason, visitors must apply in advance and hike with a guide. The trail in Chilseon Valley is a 9.4-kilometer course from Chuseong Village in Macheon-myeon to Cheonwangbong Peak, which does not follow the natural valley, due to the valleys steep and dangerous features. Starting from Chuseong Village, the trail passes Yongso Pond, Jujiteo Site, Chuseongmang Rock, Seonnyeotang Pond, Ongnyeotang Pond, Biseondam, Chilseonpokpo Falls, Daeryukpokpo Falls, Samcheungpokpo Falls and Mapokpo Falls, all before reaching Cheonwangbong Peak.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-55-970-1000|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Parking Fees:|[Hourly Parking]<br>* Applies to Jeongnyeongchi, Seongsamjae Pass, Ssanggyesa Temple Parking Lots<br>Compact cars - First hour 500 won / 100 won for each additional 10 min<br>Sedans - First hour 1,100 won /250~300  won for each additional 10 min<br>Large vehicles - First hour 2,000 won / 400~500 won for each additional 10 min<br><br>[Flat Rate Parking]<br>* Applies to Hakcheon, Dalgung, Banseon, Daewonsa Temple, Hwaeomsa Temple, Yeongoksa Temple, Siamjae Pass Parking Lots<br>Compact cars - 2,000 won<br />Sedans - Peak season 5,000 won / Off season 4,000 won<br />Large vehicles - Peak season 7,500 won / Off season 6,000 won|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-21-1671600968838/2616997_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-21-1671600968838/2616997_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-21-1671600968838/2616998_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-21-1671600968838/2616998_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-21-1671600968838/2616999_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-21-1671600968838/2616999_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-21-1671600968838/2617005_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-21-1671600968838/2617005_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-55-970-1000](tel:+82559701000)\n- [üè†jiri.knps.or.kr](http://jiri.knps.or.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.3624199518\nlongitude: 127.7212089674\ntitle: Chuseong-ri, Hamnyang-gun, Gyeongsangnam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Taxi]<br>\nApprox. 30 min from Hamyang Terminal\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-21-1671600968838","title":"Jirisan Chilseongyegok Valley (Ïπ†ÏÑ†Í≥ÑÍ≥°(ÏßÄÎ¶¨ÏÇ∞))","description":"Chilseongyegok Valley is the most beautiful valley in Jirisan Mountain, and is one of the top three valleys in the nation, along with Cheonbuldonggyegok Valley in Seoraksan Mountain and Tamnagyegok Valley in Hallasan Mountain.

It was named so because the leaves turn so crimson that the water of the valley reflects the color and appears crimson as well. This is the place where Chi-Won Choe, after returning from Dang China to Silla (BC 57-AD 935) found Korea in disarray. It was too much to bear for him so he retired to live privately with poetry until his death. <br><br>There are 19 famous places in Hongryudonggyegok Valley, including major cultural assets like Jongsangjeong Pavilion, Nakhwadam, and Bunokpok. The scenery of Nongsanjeong Pavilion, where Chi-Won Choe read poetry and played baduk, is especially beautiful.  On the opposite side is a rock where you can see the handwring of Chi-Won Choe. The Yongmunpokpo Falls, located on the north end of the valley, has beautiful scenery with its harmonious blend of falling water and Giamgoiseok (fantastic rocks and stones).  <br><br>The scenery of Hongryudonggyegok Valley changes every season, and it is the finest part of Gayasan Mountain. It is famous for the azaleas in full bloom during the spring, and for the thousand-year-old pine trees and broad-leaved trees growing thickly throughout the valley and the cool, clear water that runs through it during the summer. In the fall, the nearby pine tree forests and broad-leaved trees tinge in color and accentuate the crimson foliage of autumnal leaves, making the crimson reflection of the leaves in the valley water look like a rising flame, and shows why the valley was named Hongryudonggyegok Valley.","regDate":"2022-12-28","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Valleys"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-28-1672212935139/2625847_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-28-1672212935139"},{"id":"2022-12-28-1672209537187","title":"Hapcheon Okgyeseowon Confucian Academy (Ïò•Í≥ÑÏÑúÏõê(Ìï©Ï≤ú))","description":"Hapcheon Okgyeseowon Confucian Academy was built to store Yulgok Yi Is writings, Gyeokmongyogyeol and Haedongyeonwonnok.
