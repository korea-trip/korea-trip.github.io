The 60-kilometer watercourse connecting Chuncheon and Inje is a route along which you can enjoy the beautiful hills and streams of Naeseorak. In the Inje section, upstream of the lake, there are various species of fish such as carp, crusian, leather carp, mandarin fish and pond smelt, attracting many tourists and fisherman. Fishing spots are found in areas such as Gunchukgyo Bridge, Bupyeong, Gwandae-ri, and Sangsunaeri Fishing Pier. Also, from December and March when a portion of the lake near Gunchukgyo Bridge freezes, you can bore holes through the ice sheet and enjoy ice-fishing for pond smelt.<br><br>\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-33-460-2081~4,<br>+82-33-460-2170|\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-33-460-2081~4, +82-33-460-2170](tel:+82334602081~4, +82334602170)\n- [🏠www.gangwon.to</a> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br> <a href=\"http://tour.inje.go.kr/\" target=\"_blank\" >tour.inje.go.kr](http://www.gangwon.to)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 38.0151819190\nlongitude: 128.1422074800\ntitle: 133, Wonnam-ro, Inje-gun, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \nFrom Dong-Seoul Bus Terminal, take an intercity bus to Inje Intercity Bus Terminal.
