{"pageProps":{"content":"![Namaehang Port (남애항)](/2022-10-07-1665117224952/2711334_image2_1.webp)\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> The largest port in Yangyang area is also one of the Eight Sights of Yangyang, and along with Simgokhang Port of Gangneung and Chogokhang Port of Samcheok, said to be the three most beautiful ports in Gangwon-do. Indeed, its reputation can be seen in the picturesque view of the white and red lighthouse, breakwater, and the fishing boats docked at the port. Another point of interest at Namaehang Port is the Namaehang Skywalk Observatory. Located at the entrance to the breakwater, this observation point offers a breathtaking view of the Namaehang Port area and the East Sea. The island, where the skywalk is located, was called Yangyado Island during the Joseon period, and the site of this observation point used to have a beacon during the Joseon period. Namae Fishing Village Experience, a village that is fed by the Namaehang Port, offers fishing boat trips for visitors, along with hand fishing, rock crab catching, and stuffed squid making. Some of Namaehang Port’s major catches include squid, plaice, and flatfish. A line of restaurants specializing in raw fish slices allows visitors to enjoy the fresh catch right away.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-33-670-2397|\n|parking:|Available (30 spaces)|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Open 24 hr|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Parking Fees:|Free of charge|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Activity Fees:|Free of charge|\n|Available Facilities:|Namaehang Port|\n|Reservation Info. for Foreigners:|None|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|None|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-10-07-1665117224952/2649052_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-07-1665117224952/2649052_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-07-1665117224952/2649053_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-07-1665117224952/2649053_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-07-1665117224952/2649054_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-07-1665117224952/2649054_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-07-1665117224952/2649055_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-07-1665117224952/2649055_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-07-1665117224952/2649056_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-07-1665117224952/2649056_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-07-1665117224952/2649057_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-07-1665117224952/2649057_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-07-1665117224952/2711335_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-07-1665117224952/2711335_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-07-1665117224952/2711336_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-07-1665117224952/2711336_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-07-1665117224952/2649058_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-07-1665117224952/2649058_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-07-1665117224952/2711337_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-07-1665117224952/2711337_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-33-670-2397](tel:+82336702397)\n- [🏠tour.yangyang.go.kr](http://tour.yangyang.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.9449469437\nlongitude: 128.7871622863\ntitle: Maebawi-gil, Yangyang-gun, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Seoul Express Bus Terminal or Dong Seoul Bus Terminal, take a bus to Yangyang Intercity Bus Terminal.<br>\nFrom Yangyang Intercity Bus Terminal Bus Stop, take a local bus bound for Jigyeong-ri and get off at Namae \nElementary School, Namae 2-ri or Namae 4-ri Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-10-07-1665117224952","title":"Namaehang Port (남애항)","description":"The largest port in Yangyang area is also one of the Eight Sights of Yangyang, and along with Simgokhang Port of Gangneung and Chogokhang Port of Samcheok, said to be the three most beautiful ports in Gangwon-do.
