The first waterfall falls into a pond with a depth of 21 meters. From here, it falls two more times, creating the second and third waterfalls, which then flow into the sea. To the east of the first waterfall is a cave, where water falls from the ceiling. In the past, people believed this water had healing properties, with many people bathing in the waters. These days, swimming is strictly prohibited. In Cheonjeyeon Valley, visitors can see Seonimgyo Bridge (arch bridge with 7 nymphs carved on the side) and the octagonal Cheonjeru Pavilion. Seonimgyo Bridge is also called Chilseonyeogyo, meaning \"seven nymphs bridge,\" and it connects Cheonjeyeon Falls with Jungmum Tourist Complex. <br><br>\n\nOn the surface of Cheonjeru Pavilion, there is a painting that tells Cheonjeyeon‚Äôs legend of the seven nymphs and the mountain god.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-64-760-6331|\n|parking:|Available|\n|usetime:|09:00-19:00 <br> * Last ticketing 1 hr. before closing|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 2,500 won / Children 1,350 won <br>Groups - Adults 2,050 won / Children 850 won <br><br> * Free admission: Preschoolers (ages 6 & younger), senior citizens (ages 65 & older)<br> * Group: 10 or more people<br>* Adults (ages 25-64) / Children (ages 7-24)|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-19-1658227233086/2650702_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658227233086/2650702_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658227233086/2650703_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658227233086/2650703_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658227233086/2650705_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658227233086/2650705_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658227233086/2650706_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658227233086/2650706_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658227233086/2650707_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658227233086/2650707_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-64-760-6331](tel:+82647606331)\n- [üè†www.visitjeju.net](http://www.visitjeju.net/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.2526559999\nlongitude: 126.4184294967\ntitle: 132, Cheonjeyeon-ro, Seogwipo-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Jeju Airport, take Airport Limosine Bus 600 bound for Jungmun and get off at Yeomiji Botanical Garden Bus Stop.<br>Walk for approx. 5-10 min.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-19-1658227233086","title":"Cheonjeyeonpokpo Falls (Ï≤úÏ†úÏó∞Ìè≠Ìè¨)","description":"Cheonjeyeonpokpo Falls, named \"The Pond of God,\" consists of three sections.

Geomunoreum has an altitude of 456 meters and with lava tubes spreading out in a streamlined shape, its lava tube system is the largest of its kind on Jeju Island. The name is said to have originated when the local islanders called the cone \"Geomun,\" which is translated to ‚Äúblack,‚Äù referring to the dense forest formed on the crater. However, according to researchers and linguists, the term \"Geomun\" may have originated from a word from the Gojoseon period which were used to refer to deities, inferring that the name Geomunoreum actually means \"holy hill.\"<br><br>Geomunoreum Lava Tube System consists of roughly 20 lava tubes that follow the cone's slope to the northeast, stretching out all the way to the shore. Among these tubes, Bwengdwigul, Mangjanggul, Gimnyeonggul, Yongcheondonggul, and Dangcheondonggul Caves are inscribed as a UNESCO World Natural Heritage.","regDate":"2022-07-19","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-19-1658273804237/2661661_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2022-07-19-1658273804237"},{"id":"2022-07-19-1658270204239","title":"Geommeolle Beach (Í≤ÄÎ©ÄÎ†àÌï¥Î≥Ä)","description":"Under Udobong Peak is Geommeolle Beach, a very small beach, reaching only about 100 meters in total length, with a name literally translating to \"black sand\" in the Jeju dialect.
