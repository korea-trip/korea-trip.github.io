The river has created a valley with many interesting and uniquely shaped rocks as it flowed down the mountainside over the years. The waters are so pure, the small pebbles and sand lining the bottom of the stream can be seen clearly. There are a number of areas along the stream perfect for relaxing and enjoying some time in nature. Many families visit and enjoy fishing and the pure environment. The river is also well-known for rafting.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline:+82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br> • For more info: +82-33-249-3881|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year around)|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-10-06-1665036082838/185539_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665036082838/185539_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-06-1665036082838/1693876_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665036082838/1693876_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-06-1665036082838/1693878_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665036082838/1693878_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-06-1665036082838/1693890_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665036082838/1693890_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-06-1665036082838/1693896_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665036082838/1693896_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-06-1665036082838/2616269_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665036082838/2616269_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-06-1665036082838/2616270_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665036082838/2616270_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-06-1665036082838/2616272_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665036082838/2616272_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-06-1665036082838/2616273_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665036082838/2616273_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-06-1665036082838/1637456_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665036082838/1637456_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-33-249-3881](tel:+82332493881)\n- [🏠www.koreadmz.kr](http://www.koreadmz.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.9653962072\nlongitude: 128.2965060925\ntitle: Buk-ri, Girin-myeon, Inje-gun, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Express/Intercity Bus]<br>\nTake a bus from Dong Seoul Bus Terminal to Inje Bus Terminal.<br><br>\n\n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Inje Bus Terminal, take a bus bound for Hyeonri and get off at Riverside Park Bus Stop.\n<br><br>\n[Taxi]<br>\nApprox. 15min from Inje Bus Terminal\n","data":{"id":"2022-10-06-1665036082838","title":"Naerincheon River Pothole-Gangwon Peace National Geopark (내린천 포트홀-강원평화지역 국가지질공원)","description":"Naerincheon River starts out as a small stream on Bungnyongsan Mountain and flows down Sogyebangsan Mountain before joining with other small valley streams to create the larger river that most people know.

Walking up along the wooden deck trail among the bamboo grove leads you to the observatory, which offers an open view of the deep blue East Sea, the Cheongchoho Lake, which is home to migratory birds, and the magnificent scenery of Seoraksan Mountain. Viewed from the high tower, the East Sea unfolds its boundless ocean and sometimes it looks like a calm lake but can become an energetic ocean full of vitality. Built in 1957, Sokcho Lighthouse still lights up for ships at night. The bright light and sound of the beacon, which has been in service since the lighthouse’s establishment, can show the waterway to a boat, which is about 35 km away from the lighthouse. Right next to the observatory, Yeonggeumjeong Pavilion is situated.","regDate":"2022-10-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-13-1665647612612/2711170_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-13-1665647612612"},{"id":"2022-10-13-1665645019170","title":"Sokcho Expo Tower (속초 엑스포타워)","description":"Sokcho Expo Tower in the area of Cheongchoho Lake, Joyang-dong, is an observatory tower set in a park surrounded by mountains and lakes. <br><br>The tower is 73.4m in x_height and can accommodate up to 100 visitors at once.
