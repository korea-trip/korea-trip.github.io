Built in 1962, the area had as many as 5,000 people during the mining period, but decreased into a small fishing village of under 2,000 after the governments coal industry reform policies went into action. In the early 1990s the train rarely stopped at the station due to minimal passengers, but it gained popularity after appearing in the drama “Sandglass (1995)” and is also widely famous for its sunrise view. The Sunrise Train, a six-hour course from Cheongnyangni Station to Jeongdongjin Station, was added to accommodate more visitors. Other attractions nearby include Jeongdongjin Beach, hourglass tree and more.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <BR>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-33-640-4534|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-10-01-1664610404044/2713714_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-01-1664610404044/2713714_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-01-1664610404044/2714200_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-01-1664610404044/2714200_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-01-1664610404044/2714201_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-01-1664610404044/2714201_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-01-1664610404044/2714202_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-01-1664610404044/2714202_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n\n- [🏠www.gn.go.kr](https://www.gn.go.kr/tour/index.do)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.6914949653\nlongitude: 129.0327146846\ntitle: 17, Jeongdongyeok-gil, Gangneung-si, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-10-01-1664610404044","title":"Jeongdongjin Station (정동진역)","description":"Jeongdongjin Station is known as the train station located closest to the ocean in the nation.

The communist Chinese army launched a major offensive attack for 10 days on October 6, 1952 during the Battle of Baengmagoji, which can be translated into the Battle of White Horse Highlands. Due to this battle, the communist Chinese army suffered around 14,000 casualties and the army completely collapsed while the 9th Infantry Division won the Battle of Baengmagoji and got the nickname “White Horse.” <br><br>After the battle, the area gave off a bad smell because of the dead bodies.
