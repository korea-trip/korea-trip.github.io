It is a home to numerous alpine tree species, as well as wildflowers and herbs. Its trails are popular thanks to the gentle slopes. Gariwangsan National Recreational Forest is located at the Hoedong-ri Village entrance. The recreational forest has various amenities, but the walking path next to the valley is by far the most outstanding. The thick forest blocks out the sky while purifying the air.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-33-562-5833|\n|parking:|Available|\n|usetime:|[Accommodations] Check in 15:00 / Check out 12:00<br>[Park hours] 09:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Camping sites, cabins, recreation hall, etc.|\n|Parking Fees:|Compact cars: 1,500 won<br>Small & mid-sized vehicles: 3,000 won<br>Large vehicles: 5,000 won|\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 1,000 won / Teenagers 600 won / Children 300 won<br>Groups - Adults 800 won / Teenagers 500 won / Children 200 won<br><br>* Adults (ages 19-64) / Teenagers (ages 13-18) / Children (ages 7-12)<br>* Free admission during winter season (December-March)<br>* Free admission: Senior citizens (ages 65 & older), preschoolers (ages 6 & younger)|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582540_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582540_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582544_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582544_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582546_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582546_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582613_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582613_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582615_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582615_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582616_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582616_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582617_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582617_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582916_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582916_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582922_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582922_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582536_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582536_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-33-562-5833](tel:+82335625833)\n- [üè†www.foresttrip.go.kr](https://www.foresttrip.go.kr/indvz/main.do?hmpgId=0113)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.4268471267\nlongitude: 128.5700393556\ntitle: 707, Gariwangsan-ro, Jeongseon-gun, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Taxi]<br>\nApprox. 25 min from Jeongseon Bus Terminal.\n","data":{"id":"2022-09-23-1663926372349","title":"Gariwangsan National Recreational Forest (Íµ≠Î¶Ω Í∞ÄÎ¶¨ÏôïÏÇ∞ÏûêÏó∞Ìú¥ÏñëÎ¶º)","description":"Gariwangsan Mountain is one of the major mountains in the Taebaek Mountain Range.
