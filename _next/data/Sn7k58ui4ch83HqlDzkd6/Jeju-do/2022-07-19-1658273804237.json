Geomunoreum has an altitude of 456 meters and with lava tubes spreading out in a streamlined shape, its lava tube system is the largest of its kind on Jeju Island. The name is said to have originated when the local islanders called the cone \"Geomun,\" which is translated to ‚Äúblack,‚Äù referring to the dense forest formed on the crater. However, according to researchers and linguists, the term \"Geomun\" may have originated from a word from the Gojoseon period which were used to refer to deities, inferring that the name Geomunoreum actually means \"holy hill.\"\n<br><br>\nGeomunoreum Lava Tube System consists of roughly 20 lava tubes that follow the cone's slope to the northeast, stretching out all the way to the shore. Among these tubes, Bwengdwigul, Mangjanggul, Gimnyeonggul, Yongcheondonggul, and Dangcheondonggul Caves are inscribed as a UNESCO World Natural Heritage.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|accomcount:|450 people|\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-64-710-8981|\n|parking:|Available (100 spaces)|\n|restdate:|Tuesdays, the day of Seollal (Lunar New Year's Day) and Chuseok (Korean Thanksgiving Day)<br> * Entrance prohibited in the case of inclement weather|\n|usetime:|09:00-13:00 (based on departure time)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Tour Course Information:|* Tour Course<br>1) Summit Course: Approx. 1.8 km / 1 hr<br>2) Crater Course: Approx.  5.5 km / 2 hr 30 min<br>3) Taeguek-gil Course: Approx.  10 km / 3 hr 30 min|\n|Admission Fees:|[Geomunoreum Admission]<br>Individuals - Adults 2,000 won / Teenagers & Children 1,000 won<br />Groups - Adults 1,600 won / Teenagers & Children 800 won<br><br />[Heritage Center]<br />Individiuals - Adults 3,000 won / Teenagers & Children 2,000 won<br />Groups - Adults 2,400 won / Teenagers & Children 1,600 won<br /><br>* Senior citizens (ages 65 & over) & preschoolers (ages 6 & under): Free|\n|Available Facilities:|Jeju World Natural Heritage Center, convenience store|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Reservation Info. for Natives:|[wnhcenter.jeju.go.kr]()|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-19-1658273804237/2661661_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658273804237/2661661_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658273804237/2661663_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658273804237/2661663_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658273804237/656725_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658273804237/656725_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658273804237/656742_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658273804237/656742_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658273804237/656745_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658273804237/656745_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658273804237/656746_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658273804237/656746_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658273804237/656756_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658273804237/656756_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658273804237/656762_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658273804237/656762_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658273804237/656769_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658273804237/656769_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658273804237/656773_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658273804237/656773_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-64-710-8981](tel:+82647108981)\n- [üè†wnhcenter.jeju.go.kr</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.visitjeju.net\" target=\"_blank\">www.visitjeju.net](http://wnhcenter.jeju.go.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.4569159249\nlongitude: 126.7147325126\ntitle: 569-36, Seongyo-ro, Jeju-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Jeju International Airport, take a bus toward Pyoseon and get off at Seonheul 2-ri (Geomunoreum) Bus Stop.\n<br>\nWalk for approx. 700 m.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-19-1658273804237","title":"Geomunoreum Lava Tube [UNESCO World Natural Heritage Site] (Í±∞Î¨∏Ïò§Î¶Ñ [Ïú†ÎÑ§Ïä§ÏΩî ÏÑ∏Í≥ÑÏûêÏó∞Ïú†ÏÇ∞])","description":"Geomunoreum  Lava Tube System is a series of lava tubes that originated from the eruption of Geomunoreum, a parasatic cone.

The name changed from Bunjae Arpia in 2007 to commemorate the 15th anniversary after opening and to renew the garden as an international garden. The history of the garden started in 1963 when Seong Beom-yeong, the founder of the garden, came to Jeju and cultivated the wasteland full of rocks. The garden came into the international spotlight as the beautiful space was created from the wastelands by a single farmer. The garden has been visited by many honored public figures such as Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao from China, Nakasone from Japan, Kim Yongsun from North Korea and others. Currently, about 400 planted trees are on display. Also, visitors can see various facilities including stone walls and stone towers stacked with Jeju volcanic stones, the largest artificial waterfall in Jeju, and a pond filled with large carp at the base of the the waterfall.","regDate":"2023-02-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Botanical Gardens"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-13-1676280988564/608548_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-13-1676280988564"},{"id":"2023-02-13-1676277674763","title":"Songaksan Mountain (ÏÜ°ÏïÖÏÇ∞)","description":"Songaksan Mountain is also called 99 Bong (99 Peaks) due to its 99 small peaks. The road from Sanbanggulsa Temple in Southern Jeju to Songaksan Mountain is a famous coastal drive with breathtaking scenic views. Though not as enormous as Hallasan Mountain, the view from the peak of Songaksan is truly scenic. From the summit, one can see nearby islands such as Marado, Gapado, and Hyeongjeseom, and as far as Hallasan Mountain and the Pacific Ocean. <br><br> The main peak rises 104 meters above sea level. To the northwest of the main peak is an expansive prairie with several peaks. There is a crater about 500 meters in diameter and 80 meters in depth, with some blackish volcanic ash still remaining inside. Looking along the jagged coastline, one can spot the large man-made caves built during the Japanese occupation. The seashore at the base of Songaksan Mountain is a famous fishing ground and diverse fish such as sawedged perch and black porgy are caught here.","regDate":"2023-02-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-13-1676277674763/1620230_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-13-1676277674763"},{"id":"2023-02-13-1676273756670","title":"Someorioreum Volcanic Cone (Udobong Peak) (Ïá†Î®∏Î¶¨Ïò§Î¶Ñ(Ïö∞ÎèÑÎ¥â))","description":"Someorioreum Volcanic Cone is located on Udo Island, about 3.8 kilometers from Seongsanhang Port.

Soe means an ox, so means a pool of water and kkak means the end. This is the mouth of the Hyodoncheon Stream. As the fresh water meets the ocean, it broadens into wide, slow-flowing river. Soesokkak Estuary is lined with cliffs of curious lava formations, which are overhung with pine trees. <br>It was chosen as one of hidden picturesque scenery in Chilsip-ri, Seogwi-po, comprised of deep blue ocean, uniquely-shaped rocks formed by lava and a pine forest.<br>Soesokkak Estuary is located in Hahyo-dong on the southern side of Hallasan Mountain. The area is also well-known for its tangerines, and visitors are drawn to the area by the fresh citrus scent.

Bordered by waters that are only an average of one meter deep, the beach gently slopes at a five degree angle.
