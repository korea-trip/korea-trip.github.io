The name changed from Bunjae Arpia in 2007 to commemorate the 15th anniversary after opening and to renew the garden as an international garden. The history of the garden started in 1963 when Seong Beom-yeong, the founder of the garden, came to Jeju and cultivated the wasteland full of rocks. The garden came into the international spotlight as the beautiful space was created from the wastelands by a single farmer. The garden has been visited by many honored public figures such as Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao from China, Nakasone from Japan, Kim Yongsun from North Korea and others. Currently, about 400 planted trees are on display. Also, visitors can see various facilities including stone walls and stone towers stacked with Jeju volcanic stones, the largest artificial waterfall in Jeju, and a pond filled with large carp at the base of the the waterfall.","regDate":"2023-02-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Botanical Gardens"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-13-1676280988564/608548_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-13-1676280988564"},{"id":"2023-02-13-1676277674763","title":"Songaksan Mountain (송악산)","description":"Songaksan Mountain is also called 99 Bong (99 Peaks) due to its 99 small peaks.

Though not as enormous as Hallasan Mountain, the view from the peak of Songaksan is truly scenic. From the summit, one can see nearby islands such as Marado, Gapado, and Hyeongjeseom, and as far as Hallasan Mountain and the Pacific Ocean. <br><br> The main peak rises 104 meters above sea level. To the northwest of the main peak is an expansive prairie with several peaks. There is a crater about 500 meters in diameter and 80 meters in depth, with some blackish volcanic ash still remaining inside. Looking along the jagged coastline, one can spot the large man-made caves built during the Japanese occupation.

Bordered by waters that are only an average of one meter deep, the beach gently slopes at a five degree angle.
