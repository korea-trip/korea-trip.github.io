The island is quite small, at only 300 „é°, and is home to approximately 80 people in 30 families. The island is famous for sea fishing, and is accessible via ferry from Museulpo Port.<br><br>Marado Island first became inhabited in 1883, when three families began living there. At first they lived off the food growing there, but once the food became scarce, they burned the forests to create fields for farming. It was said that all the snakes and frogs died in that fire, and thus no snakes and frogs are found in Marado Island even until now.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-64-760-4014|\n|parking:|Available at the harbor|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Accommodations, restaurants, Marado Lighthouse, Pioneer Open Air Museum, The Southernmost Monument, etc.|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-02-10-1676004031764/200086_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-10-1676004031764/200086_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-10-1676004031764/200099_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-10-1676004031764/200099_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-10-1676004031764/200111_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-10-1676004031764/200111_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-10-1676004031764/865913_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-10-1676004031764/865913_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-10-1676004031764/1281904_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-10-1676004031764/1281904_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-10-1676004031764/1281919_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-10-1676004031764/1281919_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-10-1676004031764/1281923_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-10-1676004031764/1281923_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-10-1676004031764/1281935_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-10-1676004031764/1281935_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-10-1676004031764/200116_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-10-1676004031764/200116_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-10-1676004031764/1281917_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-10-1676004031764/1281917_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-64-760-4014](tel:+82647604014)\n- [üè†www.jejumarado.com](http://www.jejumarado.com/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.1186350844\nlongitude: 126.2674344514\ntitle: 46, Mara-ro 101beon-gil, Seogwipo-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Ferry]<br>\nTake a ferry from Museulpo Port to Marado Island.\n","data":{"id":"2023-02-10-1676004031764","title":"Marado Island (Mara Provincial Park) (ÎßàÎùºÎèÑ(ÎßàÎùºÌï¥ÏñëÎèÑÎ¶ΩÍ≥µÏõê))","description":"Marado Island is the southernmost island in Korea and features one seemingly endless plain of waving grass for a unique landscape.

The history of the garden started in 1963 when Seong Beom-yeong, the founder of the garden, came to Jeju and cultivated the wasteland full of rocks. The garden came into the international spotlight as the beautiful space was created from the wastelands by a single farmer. The garden has been visited by many honored public figures such as Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao from China, Nakasone from Japan, Kim Yongsun from North Korea and others. Currently, about 400 planted trees are on display. Also, visitors can see various facilities including stone walls and stone towers stacked with Jeju volcanic stones, the largest artificial waterfall in Jeju, and a pond filled with large carp at the base of the the waterfall.","regDate":"2023-02-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Botanical Gardens"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-13-1676280988564/608548_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-13-1676280988564"},{"id":"2023-02-13-1676277674763","title":"Songaksan Mountain (ÏÜ°ÏïÖÏÇ∞)","description":"Songaksan Mountain is also called 99 Bong (99 Peaks) due to its 99 small peaks.

From the summit, one can see nearby islands such as Marado, Gapado, and Hyeongjeseom, and as far as Hallasan Mountain and the Pacific Ocean. <br><br> The main peak rises 104 meters above sea level. To the northwest of the main peak is an expansive prairie with several peaks. There is a crater about 500 meters in diameter and 80 meters in depth, with some blackish volcanic ash still remaining inside. Looking along the jagged coastline, one can spot the large man-made caves built during the Japanese occupation.
