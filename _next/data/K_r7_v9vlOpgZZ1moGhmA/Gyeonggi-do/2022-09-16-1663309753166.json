{"pageProps":{"content":"\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> Paju Unification Park was built in Bongseo-ri, Paju-eup, in June 1973 to pay tribute to the soldiers who fought in the defense of the South during the Korean War, as well as to pray for unification. It is situated near Munsan Station where the UN War Correspondent Center was located during the armistice talks. A monument rests within the park that pays tribute to the 18 Korean and foreign war correspondents who died trying to share their, often tragic, stories of the war. They include Han Gyu-ho of the Seoul Shinmun as well as journalists from the U.S. (10 people), Britain (4 people), France (2 people) and the Philippines (1 person). There is also a tower built to commemorate the loyalty and courage of 10 brave soldiers who sacrificed themselves in a bomb attack, a memorial tower dedicated to anticommunist guerilla units from the Gaema Plateau, and a statue of Colonel Lee Yu-jung and Second Lieutenant Kim Man-sul.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-31-940-4631|\n|opendate:|1973|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Available Facilities:|Unification Security Exhibition Hall, the nothernmost point of the railway, Mangbaedan Altar, memorial monuments, snack bar, sports facilities, Unification Park resting area (+82-31-953-0847)|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-31-940-4631](tel:+82319404631)\n- [🏠tour.paju.go.kr](http://tour.paju.go.kr/index.do)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.8513232698\nlongitude: 126.7905662159\ntitle: 1586-24, Tongil-ro, Paju-si, Gyeonggi-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway + Bus]<BR>\nMunsan Station (Gyeongui-Jungang Line)<BR>\nTake Bus No. 12 or 909 and get off at Unification Park Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-09-16-1663309753166","title":"Paju Unification Park (통일공원(파주))","description":"Paju Unification Park was built in Bongseo-ri, Paju-eup, in June 1973 to pay tribute to the soldiers who fought in the defense of the South during the Korean War, as well as to pray for unification.

In 1991 a land reclaimation project succeeded in creating a new recreation site. Now there are many seafood restaurants, various auxiliary facilities, and an amusement park that rest on reclaimed land. Because the inlet is located on the west coast where the difference in the water level between high and low tide is great, fishing boats avoid the area during the shifting tides. But, whenever the boats return, visitors can enjoy fresh sushi and other seafood. The Marine World facilities have authentic European-style restaurants, an outdoor seawater pool that can be used free of charge, and a barbecue facility along with other amenities.","regDate":"2022-09-19","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-19-1663593675934/2524568_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-09-19-1663593675934"},{"id":"2022-09-17-1663397434630","title":"Songam Space Center (송암스페이스센터)","description":"Songam Space Center, set against the gorgeous backdrop of nearby Jangheung Park, Yangju-si, Gyeonggi-do, is one of the largest space themed parks in Korea.
