It has been called Shipjagul (meaning ‘cross’ in Korean) Cave because it looks like a cross when viewed from the sky.  If you go on the tour, you will be fascinated by the x_height of the rock walls and the inside of the cave.  A long time ago, scholars expressed their yearning for the beauty of nature by writing and reading poems they wrote on sailboats with a bowl of makkoli (rice wine) in their hands.<br><br>When you take a ship around the island, you’ll be fascinated once more because of the great works such as the Maitreya Rock, which reflects on Eunjin Maitreya, Candlestick Rock and the 1,300 year old guardian pine tree of Haegeumgang River.<br><br>","regDate":"2022-12-16","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-16-1671168960118/2612889_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-16-1671168960118"},{"id":"2022-12-16-1671165529886","title":"Geochang Suseungdae Rock (거창 수승대)","description":"Suseungdae Rock is located near Hwangsan Village in Geochang-gun, Gyeongsangnam-do.
