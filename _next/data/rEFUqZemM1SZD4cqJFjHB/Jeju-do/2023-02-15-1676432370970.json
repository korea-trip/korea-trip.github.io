This area is made of sandstone stacks, built up over millions of years. There are coastal caves here which are depressed into the shape of rooms, and wide rocks stacking up on one another along the seashore cliffs which create a majestic scenery by the sea.  Along the road down to the seashore, there is the Hamel Castaway Memorial, in remembrance of Hamel who drifted to this place in 1653. The coastal walking path is a popular date course, and haenyeo (female sea-divers) often sell freshly caught sea cucumbers and other seafood in the area.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-64-794-2940|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|09:00-19:00 (Last ticketing 18:00)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|[Sanbangsan Mountain & Yongmeori Beach Combined Ticket] <br>Individuals: Adults 2,500 won / Children 1,500 won<br>Groups: Adults 2,000 won / Children 1,000 won<br><br>[Yongmeori Beach]<br>Individuals: Adults 2,000 won / Children 1,000 won<br>Groups: Adults 1,600 won / Children 600 won<br><br>* Adults (ages 13 and older) / Children (ages 7-12)|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Public parking lot - free<br />Private parking lot - paid|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-02-15-1676432370970/286952_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-15-1676432370970/286952_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-15-1676432370970/286954_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-15-1676432370970/286954_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-15-1676432370970/286956_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-15-1676432370970/286956_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-15-1676432370970/286965_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-15-1676432370970/286965_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-15-1676432370970/492111_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-15-1676432370970/492111_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-15-1676432370970/2369545_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-15-1676432370970/2369545_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-15-1676432370970/2370831_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-15-1676432370970/2370831_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-64-794-2940](tel:+82647942940)\n- [üè†www.visitjeju.net](https://www.visitjeju.net/kr/detail/view?contentsid=CONT_000000000500471)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.2322593962\nlongitude: 126.3145222990\ntitle: 218-10, Sanbang-ro, Seogwipo-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2023-02-15-1676432370970","title":"Yongmeori Beach (Ïö©Î®∏Î¶¨Ìï¥Ïïà)","description":"Yongmeori Beach is where Sanbangsan Mountain stretches into the ocean and it looks as if a dragon‚Äôs head is going underwater.

Records show people have been living on the islands since as long as 1271, during the reign of Goryeo King Wonjong, at which point they were referred to as Hupungdo Islands, serving as a safe harbor for ships sailing between Jeju and the mainland. The name changed to Chujado Islands during the Joseon dynasty due to the lush forest of walnut trees, chuja in the Jeollanam-do dialect.

Created particularly close to the earth‚Äôs surface, this cave has a number of entrance holes to the tunnel. Inside, the complex structure of the cave unfolds in the form of double-tiered or triple-tiered rooms.

The pond is so deep that the bottom cannot be seen. The wooden Yongyeon Cloud Bridge crossing the pond and the pavilion are in harmony with the valley landscape. Legend has it that the pond was created by the water raining down off of a dragon that ascended to heaven.

There are many legends surrounding the rock. One legend has it that a dragon stealing precious jade from Hallasan Mountain was shot down by an arrow from the mountain deity. When he fell down, his body immediately sank into the ocean and his head rapidly froze looking at the sky. Another legend has it that a white horse, who dreamed of being a dragon and ascending to the sky, came to be caught by a soldier and froze into the rock.<br><br>From Yongduam Rock, visitors can see haenyeo (female divers) working at catching seafood. Near the rock are various cafes, bars, and restaurants. The coastal road between here and Aewol-eup is popular among couples.
