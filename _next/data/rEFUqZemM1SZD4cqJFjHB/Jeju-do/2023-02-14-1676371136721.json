There are many legends surrounding the rock. One legend has it that a dragon stealing precious jade from Hallasan Mountain was shot down by an arrow from the mountain deity. When he fell down, his body immediately sank into the ocean and his head rapidly froze looking at the sky. Another legend has it that a white horse, who dreamed of being a dragon and ascending to the sky, came to be caught by a soldier and froze into the rock.<br><br>From Yongduam Rock, visitors can see haenyeo (female divers) working at catching seafood. Near the rock are various cafes, bars, and restaurants. The coastal road between here and Aewol-eup is popular among couples. Cafes and seafood restaurants began to appear there five years ago and now form a pleasant caf√© village.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ Jeju Travel Hotline: +82-64-740-6000|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Restaurants, gift shop, snack bar, restroom, drinking fountain, Tourist Information Center, etc.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Available in English, Japanese, Chinese |\n  \n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-64-740-6000](tel:+82647406000)\n- [üè†www.visitjeju.net](http://www.visitjeju.net/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.5158033889\nlongitude: 126.5119710049\ntitle: Yongduam-gil, Jeju-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Jeju International Airport, take a bus bound for Jeju-si Jungang-ro and get off at Yongdam Rotary.<br>\nWalk toward the beach for 5-10 minutes.<br><br>\n\n[Taxi]<br>\nApprox. 10 min from Jeju International Airport\n","data":{"id":"2023-02-14-1676371136721","title":"Yongduam Rock (Ïö©ÎëêÏïî)","description":"Situated on the northern coast in downtown Jeju, Yongduam Rock is an estimated 10-meter-tall stone that has been worn down over time by strong winds and waves into a shape resembling a dragons head.

Records show people have been living on the islands since as long as 1271, during the reign of Goryeo King Wonjong, at which point they were referred to as Hupungdo Islands, serving as a safe harbor for ships sailing between Jeju and the mainland. The name changed to Chujado Islands during the Joseon dynasty due to the lush forest of walnut trees, chuja in the Jeollanam-do dialect. The ocean around the islands is a popular place for sea fishing, while the islands themselves offer outstanding views of nature along a Jeju Olle Trail Course.","regDate":"2023-02-15","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-15-1676446569108/870922_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-15-1676446569108"},{"id":"2023-02-15-1676443201688","title":"Byeoldobong Peak (Beri Oreum) (Î≥ÑÎèÑÎ¥â(Î≤†Î¶¨Ïò§Î¶Ñ))","description":"Situated in the east of Hwabuk 1-dong and along the coast, Byeoldobong is a parasitic mountain made of siliciclastic sedimentary rocks and lava.

Created particularly close to the earth‚Äôs surface, this cave has a number of entrance holes to the tunnel. Inside, the complex structure of the cave unfolds in the form of double-tiered or triple-tiered rooms.

Legend has it that the pond was created by the water raining down off of a dragon that ascended to heaven.
