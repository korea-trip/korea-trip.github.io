At first they lived off the food growing there, but once the food became scarce, they burned the forests to create fields for farming. It was said that all the snakes and frogs died in that fire, and thus no snakes and frogs are found in Marado Island even until now.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-64-760-4014|\n|parking:|Available at the harbor|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Accommodations, restaurants, Marado Lighthouse, Pioneer Open Air Museum, The Southernmost Monument, etc.|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-02-10-1676004031764/200086_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-10-1676004031764/200086_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-10-1676004031764/200099_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-10-1676004031764/200099_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-10-1676004031764/200111_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-10-1676004031764/200111_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-10-1676004031764/865913_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-10-1676004031764/865913_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-10-1676004031764/1281904_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-10-1676004031764/1281904_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-10-1676004031764/1281919_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-10-1676004031764/1281919_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-10-1676004031764/1281923_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-10-1676004031764/1281923_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-10-1676004031764/1281935_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-10-1676004031764/1281935_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-10-1676004031764/200116_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-10-1676004031764/200116_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-10-1676004031764/1281917_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-10-1676004031764/1281917_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-64-760-4014](tel:+82647604014)\n- [üè†www.jejumarado.com](http://www.jejumarado.com/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.1186350844\nlongitude: 126.2674344514\ntitle: 46, Mara-ro 101beon-gil, Seogwipo-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Ferry]<br>\nTake a ferry from Museulpo Port to Marado Island.\n","data":{"id":"2023-02-10-1676004031764","title":"Marado Island (Mara Provincial Park) (ÎßàÎùºÎèÑ(ÎßàÎùºÌï¥ÏñëÎèÑÎ¶ΩÍ≥µÏõê))","description":"Marado Island is the southernmost island in Korea and features one seemingly endless plain of waving grass for a unique landscape.

The name changed to Chujado Islands during the Joseon dynasty due to the lush forest of walnut trees, chuja in the Jeollanam-do dialect.

Created particularly close to the earth‚Äôs surface, this cave has a number of entrance holes to the tunnel. Inside, the complex structure of the cave unfolds in the form of double-tiered or triple-tiered rooms.
