Over a period of 80 years, the settlers had led their religious lives without a priest until Father Le Merre (a French priest) came to the village in 1888. Succeeding Le Merre in 1896, Father Jeong Gyu-ha (or Augustino), along with Chinese engineers, began to build Pungsuwon Cathedral.<br><br>Completed in 1907 by the faithful, the cathedral still remains a beautiful building even after 110 years; it is a popular spot for visitors, having frequently appeared in Korean dramas and films such as “Love Letter (1995 MBC miniseries).” It is the first cathedral built by a Korean priest as well as in Gangwon-do; it is the fourth cathedral built in Korea. Pungsuwon Cathedral was designated as Gangwon-do Local Cultural Property No.69 in 1982.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-33-342-0035|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Film Locations:|Various dramas|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Not available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-10-08-1665226058950/1583972_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-08-1665226058950/1583972_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-08-1665226058950/1583974_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-08-1665226058950/1583974_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-08-1665226058950/1583975_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-08-1665226058950/1583975_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-08-1665226058950/2480279_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-08-1665226058950/2480279_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-08-1665226058950/2480280_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-08-1665226058950/2480280_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-08-1665226058950/2480281_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-08-1665226058950/2480281_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-08-1665226058950/2480283_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-08-1665226058950/2480283_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-08-1665226058950/2480284_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-08-1665226058950/2480284_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-08-1665226058950/1583973_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-08-1665226058950/1583973_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-08-1665226058950/1583976_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-08-1665226058950/1583976_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-33-342-0035](tel:+82333420035)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5292128056\nlongitude: 127.8186624439\ntitle: 30, Gyeonggang-ro yuhyeon 1-gil, Seowon-myeon, Hoengseong-gun, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Seoul Sangbong Bus Terminal, take an intercity \nbus to Hoengseong Bus Terminal.<br>From Hoengseong Bus Terminal, take a bus bound for Pungsuwon.\n","data":{"id":"2022-10-08-1665226058950","title":"Pungsuwon Catholic Church (횡성 풍수원천주교회(풍수원성당))","description":"Pungsuwon was the first catholic village in which over 40 faithful from Yongin (Gyeonggi-do), led by Sin Tae-bo (or St. Peter), settled to escape the wrath of Sinyubakhae (religious persecution of Catholics) of 1801.

Driving from Chuncheon to the dam will take about one hour, but the Kwaeryongho Boat, a hovercraft that operates regularly on Soyangho Lake, only takes about 30 minutes. The hovercraft travels by ejecting air against the surface below, sending up a spray of water on either side of the boat to the delight of passengers. In the valley, visitors can see fish farms floating among the islets. When the water level is high, it is possible to travel on the lake all the way to Inje and Sinnam, enjoying the beautiful scenery of Seoraksan Mountain. Both tourists and locals regularly make use of the ferry service.","regDate":"2022-10-14","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-14-1665729241153/176171_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-14-1665729241153"},{"id":"2022-10-14-1665723965765","title":"Soyangho Lake (Inje Section) (소양호-인제)","description":"Soyangho Lake (소양호), one of the biggest manmade lakes in Korea, along with Chungjuho Lake (충주호), was created in 1973 when the world’s fourth largest dam, Soyang Dam, standing 123 meters high, was constructed.
