Driving from Chuncheon to the dam will take about one hour, but the Kwaeryongho Boat, a hovercraft that operates regularly on Soyangho Lake, only takes about 30 minutes. The hovercraft travels by ejecting air against the surface below, sending up a spray of water on either side of the boat to the delight of passengers. In the valley, visitors can see fish farms floating among the islets. When the water level is high, it is possible to travel on the lake all the way to Inje and Sinnam, enjoying the beautiful scenery of Seoraksan Mountain. Both tourists and locals regularly make use of the ferry service.","regDate":"2022-10-14","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-14-1665729241153/176171_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-14-1665729241153"},{"id":"2022-10-14-1665723965765","title":"Soyangho Lake (Inje Section) (ÏÜåÏñëÌò∏-Ïù∏Ï†ú)","description":"Soyangho Lake (ÏÜåÏñëÌò∏), one of the biggest manmade lakes in Korea, along with Chungjuho Lake (Ï∂©Ï£ºÌò∏), was created in 1973 when the world‚Äôs fourth largest dam, Soyang Dam, standing 123 meters high, was constructed.
