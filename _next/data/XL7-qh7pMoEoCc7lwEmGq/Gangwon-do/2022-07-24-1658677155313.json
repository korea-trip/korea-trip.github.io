Photos of the family on vacation there show Kim Jungil as a young boy of six years. The building was constructed entirely of stone in 1938 by a German architect for the Sherwood Hall missionary family, and features a basement level and two above-ground floors. The house is now open to the public, with an exhibition of how the house was used by the Kim family, faithfully recreated from photographic research.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-33-680-3677|\n|opendate:|July 1999|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Summer 09:00-18:00 <br>Winter 09:00-17:30<br>* Last ticketing 1 hr before closing|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|[Hwajinpo History & Security Museum] <br />Individuals: Adults 3,000 won / Teenagers & Children 2,300 won <br />Groups: Adults 2,300 won / Teenagers & Children 1,600 won <br /><br>* Group: 30 people or more<br />* Admission includes Villa of Rhee Syngman, Villa of Lee Ki-poong, Castle of Hwajinpo & Ecology Museum <br />* Free admission: senior citizens (ages 65 and older)|\n|Restrooms:|Available at parking lot|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Available - English, Japanese, Chinese<br>* Advance reservation required at Hwajinpo Tourist Information Center|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-24-1658677155313/2600598_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658677155313/2600598_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658677155313/2600599_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658677155313/2600599_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658677155313/2600600_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658677155313/2600600_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658677155313/571638_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658677155313/571638_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658677155313/571640_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658677155313/571640_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658677155313/571641_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658677155313/571641_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-33-680-3677](tel:+82336803677)\n- [üè†www.gwgs.go.kr](https://www.gwgs.go.kr/tour/index.do)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 38.4725399459\nlongitude: 128.4431686945\ntitle: 280, Hwajinpo-gil, Goseong-gun, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus + Taxi]<br>\nFrom Dong Seoul Bus Terminal, take a bus to Ganseong Intercity Bus Terminal.<br>From Ganseong Bus Terminal, take a taxi for approx. 15 min.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-24-1658677155313","title":"Castle at Hwajinpo (ÌôîÏßÑÌè¨Ïùò ÏÑ±(ÍπÄÏùºÏÑ±Î≥ÑÏû•))","description":"The Castle of Hwajinpo was the summer retreat for Kim Ilsung, former leader of North Korea, and his family from 1948 to 1950.

Driving from Chuncheon to the dam will take about one hour, but the Kwaeryongho Boat, a hovercraft that operates regularly on Soyangho Lake, only takes about 30 minutes. The hovercraft travels by ejecting air against the surface below, sending up a spray of water on either side of the boat to the delight of passengers. In the valley, visitors can see fish farms floating among the islets. When the water level is high, it is possible to travel on the lake all the way to Inje and Sinnam, enjoying the beautiful scenery of Seoraksan Mountain. Both tourists and locals regularly make use of the ferry service.","regDate":"2022-10-14","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-14-1665729241153/176171_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-14-1665729241153"},{"id":"2022-10-14-1665723965765","title":"Soyangho Lake (Inje Section) (ÏÜåÏñëÌò∏-Ïù∏Ï†ú)","description":"Soyangho Lake (ÏÜåÏñëÌò∏), one of the biggest manmade lakes in Korea, along with Chungjuho Lake (Ï∂©Ï£ºÌò∏), was created in 1973 when the world‚Äôs fourth largest dam, Soyang Dam, standing 123 meters high, was constructed.
