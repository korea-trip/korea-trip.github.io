During the early years of Catholicism in Korea, Catholics fleeing from the Sinhae Persecution (1791) came to this place, formed a community, and made their faith deeper. Amid the persecution in 1801, A man named Hwang Sa-yeong (Alexander, 1775‚Äì1801) hid in a tunnel and wrote letters about the situation of the Joseon Catholic Church on silk fabrics, but was captured and martyred. Baeron is also a historic place where Joseon‚Äôs first theological school, St. Joseph Theological School, was founded, but the school was eventually shut down. The graves of Fr. Thomas Choe Yang-eop (1821‚Äì1861), Korea‚Äôs second Roman Catholic priest, and the Martyr Hwang Sa-yeong Memorial Tower can be seen at Baeron Holy Ground.<br> <br> Baeron Holy Ground is surrounded by rugged mountains such as Guhaksan Mountain, Baegunsan Mountain and Chiaksan Mountain. The mountain path from the holy ground eventually leads to Bakdaljae Natural Forest.","regDate":"2022-07-26","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Holy Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-26-1658810928103/2026149_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Chungcheongbuk-do/2022-07-26-1658810928103","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Chungcheongbuk-do/2022-07-26-1658810928103"},{"id":"2022-07-26-1658804661068","title":"Angseong Carbonate Hot Springs (ÏïôÏÑ±ÌÉÑÏÇ∞Ïò®Ï≤ú)","description":"The water at Angseong Carbonate Hot Springs comes from 700 meters underground.
