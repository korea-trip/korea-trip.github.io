Cheonggye Plaza roughly covers an area of 2,500 square meters, and is located at the starting point of Cheonggyecheon Stream. The square, created based on the design of  traditional \nKorean <em>bojagi</em> (a colorful wrapping cloth), features the elegant beauty of traditional stonework that is colorful yet refined. The plaza also includes a model of Cheonggyecheon that provides visitors with a bird's-eye view of the restored Cheonggyecheon Stream. At the plaza, there are plaques that provide detailed commentaries on the 22 bridges that span the stream, as well as a number of graceful fountains that add to the ambience of the area. The area commemorates the Cheonggyecheon Stream Restoration Project, and also symbolizes gathering, harmony, peace, and unity.<br><br>\nAfter the completion of Cheonggye Plaza, Seoul Metropolitan Government designated the area as a vehicle-free zone on holidays, providing more leisure space for pedestrians. Since then, the waterfront areas of Cheonggyecheon Stream, and the surrounding streets have become popular places for those seeking refreshment and a variety of cultural experiences. A favorite of many is the Candle Fountain, which features the magnificent synchronicity of three different lighting fixtures and a four-meter-high, two-tiered waterfall. Along the two sides of the waterfall are the Palseokdam wishing wells, made of eight different stones from each of the nation's eight provinces.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|expagerange:|N/A (Open to visitors of all ages)|\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <BR> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-2-2290-6114|\n|parking:|Available (public parking lot)|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Open 24 hr|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Available Facilities:|Panjajip, Digital Garden/Canvas|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-21-1658418118385/1569238_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658418118385/1569238_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658418118385/1570293_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658418118385/1570293_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658418118385/2644091_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658418118385/2644091_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658418118385/2644092_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658418118385/2644092_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658418118385/2644095_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658418118385/2644095_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658418118385/2644097_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658418118385/2644097_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-2-2290-6114](tel:+82222906114)\n- [üè†www.sisul.or.kr](http://www.sisul.or.kr/open_content/cheonggye/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5697015781\nlongitude: 127.0050907302\ntitle: Changsin-dong, Jung-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-21-1658418118385","title":"Cheonggyecheon Stream (Ï≤≠Í≥ÑÏ≤ú)","description":"Cheonggyecheon Stream starts from Cheonggye Plaza, just off Sejong-ro Avenue.

Red pine trees salvaged from the demolition of Gyeongungung Palace were used to construct the house. It was originally located in Jegi-dong, Dongdaemun-gu, but was later restored and moved to its present location. The shrine of the house that was destroyed in 1960 was also restored. <br>Because the house is more of a shrine rather than residential living quarters, it has many unique features.

The name later changed again to the current Gyeonghuigung Palace in 1760. The palace grounds included many halls but they were mostly all burned down in a fire in 1829. After the Japanese occupation began, all remaining buildings on the site were torn down and the palace grounds were turned into Gyeongseong Middle School (now Seoul High School). The school moved to Gangnam area in 1987, afterwhich the previous location was turned into a park. The palace grounds currently hold Seoul Museum of Art and walking paths, as well as a restoration of Heunghwamun Gate, the main gate of the palace, and Sungjeongjeon Hall, the main hall, completed in November 1994.","regDate":"2022-07-23","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Palaces"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-23-1658597858400/1568231_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-07-23-1658597858400"},{"id":"2022-07-23-1658595062438","title":"Gyeongbokgung Palace (Í≤ΩÎ≥µÍ∂Å)","description":"Built in 1395, Gyeongbokgung Palace is commonly referred to as the Northern Palace because its location is furthest north when compared to the neighboring palaces of Changdeokgung (Eastern Palace) and Gyeonghuigung (Western Palace).
