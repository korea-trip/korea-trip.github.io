It is the most famous place for fall colors in Seoraksan Mountain, and its handsome valley and rock formations are well-known as well. Its name, Jujeongol, is said to come from the Joseon-era bandits that are said to have settled in the area, making their living with counterfeit (ju) coins (jeon) while disguised as Buddhist monks. Osaek (meaning ‚Äúfive colors‚Äù) was inspired by the five colors of Jujeongol‚Äôs rock formations, and the five-colored tree that is said to have lived in Osaekseoksa Temple of the past. A 3.2 km-long trail brings visitors along the rising rocks next to the valley, connecting Seongguksa Temple and Seonnyeotang Pothole to Yongso Falls Information Center. It is a relatively flat, 1 hr-long course with many wooden decks that help to make it more accessible for the visitors. The entrance to the trail is the location of the Osaek Mineral Spring, whose natural carbonation and iron content impart a unique flavor in the water. Keep your eyes open for strange rock formations like Gorae, Sangtu, and Bubu Rocks, as well as Namseorak‚Äôs famous sights like Seonnyeotang Pothole, Geumgangmun Gate, and Yongso Falls.","regDate":"2022-10-07","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Valleys"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-07-1665140056405/1955866_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-07-1665140056405"},{"id":"2022-10-07-1665136282609","title":"Ojukheon House (Í∞ïÎ¶â Ïò§Ï£ΩÌóå)","description":"Ojukheon House was where Yi I (penname Yulgok; scholar and politician of the Joseon Period) was born.
