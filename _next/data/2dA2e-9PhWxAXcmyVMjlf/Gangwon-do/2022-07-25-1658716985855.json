Legend has it that Monk Doseon founded this temple because a 91 centimeter-tall iron seated Vairocana Buddha statue had disappeared while being carried to Anyangsa Temple in Cheorwon and was mysteriously found seated at the current site. <br><br>The temple was named Dopiansa to indicate that the iron-made Buddha statue had reached “pian,” meaning an eternal place to rest. In addition to the legendary iron seated Variocana Buddha statue (National Treasure No. 63) made by Monk Doseon, the temple houses a 4.1 meter-tall three-story stone pagoda (Treasure No. 223).\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotliine: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-33-455-2471|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Open 24 hr|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Not available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-25-1658716985855/1135548_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658716985855/1135548_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658716985855/1135569_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658716985855/1135569_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658716985855/1135585_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658716985855/1135585_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658716985855/1135598_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658716985855/1135598_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658716985855/1135618_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658716985855/1135618_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658716985855/1135620_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658716985855/1135620_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658716985855/1135629_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658716985855/1135629_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658716985855/1135631_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658716985855/1135631_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658716985855/1135633_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658716985855/1135633_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-33-455-2471](tel:+82334552471)\n- [🏠www.cwg.go.kr](https://www.cwg.go.kr/tour/index.do)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 38.2403050273\nlongitude: 127.2182962522\ntitle: 23, Dopidong-gil, Cheorwon-gun, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-25-1658716985855","title":"Cheorwon Dopiansa Temple (도피안사(철원))","description":"Dopiansa Temple was built by the Buddhist Monk Doseon in 865, the 5th year of the reign of King Gyeongmun of the Unified Silla Period.
