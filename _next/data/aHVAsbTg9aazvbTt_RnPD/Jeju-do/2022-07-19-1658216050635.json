However, despite their wide appearance, a lack of historical documents has hampered the true understanding of the statues. Bukchon Dol Hareubang Park puts together a wide variety of the statutes and, in doing so, illuminates their aesthetic and scholarly importance to visitors as well as future generations. In this sense, the park is not only a tourist attraction, but also a learning center for children and adults alike. The park consists of 48 Dol Hareubang, a promenade, reinterpreted Dol Hareubang focusing on the theme of peace, a traditional local garden with walking paths, and a learning center.<br><br>\n\n Dol Hareubang were previously called by various names, including Useokmok, Museokmok, or Byeoksumeori. Dol Hareubang became the official name in 1971 after being designated as a local folk heritage. Although Dol Hareubang were originally seen only around the entrance of government seats, there are over 48 officially recognized Dol Hareubang throughout the island (21 in Jeju City, 2 in National Folk Museum of Korea, 12 in Seongeup, and 13 in Daejeong), along with many replicas. The shamanistic statues are believed to offer protection and ward off demons. According to Tamnaji (Record of Tamna), Dol Hareubang are believed to have been initiated by Kim Mong-gyu, then Magistrate of Jeju in 1754 (30th year of King Yeongjo’s reign).\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-64-782-0570|\n|parking:|Available|\n|usetime:|April-October 09:00-18:00<br>November-March 09:00-17:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Adults 6,000 won / Teenagers 4,000 won |\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620008_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620008_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620009_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620009_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620010_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620010_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620011_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620011_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620012_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620012_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620013_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620013_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620014_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620014_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620015_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620015_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-64-782-0570](tel:+82647820570)\n- [🏠www.visitjeju.net](https://www.visitjeju.net/kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.5396035971\nlongitude: 126.6896605755\ntitle: 70, Bukchonseo 1-gil, Jeju-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>\nFrom Jeju Bus Terminal take a local bus bound for Seongsan and get off at Bukchon Elementary School Bus Stop. <Br> Walk for approx. 700 m towards Hallasan Mountain.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-19-1658216050635","title":"Bukchon Dol Hareubang Park (북촌 돌하르방공원)","description":"As a main symbol of Jeju Island, Dol Hareubang, literally meaning \"Old Grandfather\" stone statues, can be found everywhere on the island.

Geomunoreum has an altitude of 456 meters and with lava tubes spreading out in a streamlined shape, its lava tube system is the largest of its kind on Jeju Island. The name is said to have originated when the local islanders called the cone \"Geomun,\" which is translated to “black,” referring to the dense forest formed on the crater. However, according to researchers and linguists, the term \"Geomun\" may have originated from a word from the Gojoseon period which were used to refer to deities, inferring that the name Geomunoreum actually means \"holy hill.\"<br><br>Geomunoreum Lava Tube System consists of roughly 20 lava tubes that follow the cone's slope to the northeast, stretching out all the way to the shore. Among these tubes, Bwengdwigul, Mangjanggul, Gimnyeonggul, Yongcheondonggul, and Dangcheondonggul Caves are inscribed as a UNESCO World Natural Heritage.","regDate":"2022-07-19","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-19-1658273804237/2661661_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2022-07-19-1658273804237"},{"id":"2022-07-19-1658270204239","title":"Geommeolle Beach (검멀레해변)","description":"Under Udobong Peak is Geommeolle Beach, a very small beach, reaching only about 100 meters in total length, with a name literally translating to \"black sand\" in the Jeju dialect.
