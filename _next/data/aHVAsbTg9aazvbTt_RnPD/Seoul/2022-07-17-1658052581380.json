The fountain is programmed to play different shows during the day and night. During the day, the fountain shows a hundred different configurations meant to evoke waving willow branches and willow leaves. When the sun goes down, 200 lights illuminate the fountain as it sends out dancing, rainbow-colored jets of water in the air in synchronization with music. <br><br>\n\nBanpo Bridge Rainbow Fountain operates every day from April to October, four to six times a day for 20 minutes. The park also includes an outdoor stage, ecological observing site, and picnic areas.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-2-3780-0578|\n|parking:|Available (Four parking lots / 823 spaces)|\n|usetime:|5~8 times daily<br />* Hours vary by day and season.|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Parking Fees:|Paid parking|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Snack bars (2)|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-17-1658052581380/2030892_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-17-1658052581380/2030892_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-17-1658052581380/2030901_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-17-1658052581380/2030901_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-17-1658052581380/2616878_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-17-1658052581380/2616878_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-17-1658052581380/2616880_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-17-1658052581380/2616880_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-17-1658052581380/2616882_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-17-1658052581380/2616882_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-17-1658052581380/2616883_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-17-1658052581380/2616883_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-2-3780-0578](tel:+82237800578)\n- [üè†hangang.seoul.go.kr](http://hangang.seoul.go.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5076780054\nlongitude: 126.9926825046\ntitle: 40, Sinbanpo-ro 11-gil, Seocho-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway]<br>\nExpress Bus Terminal Station (Seoul Subway Line 3, 7, 9), Exit 8-1.<br>\nWalk for approx. 10 min<br><br>\n\n[Bus]<br>\nGet off at Banpo Hangang Park/Seom Sevit Bus Stop.<br>\nBlue Bus 740\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-17-1658052581380","title":"Banpo Bridge Rainbow Fountain (Î∞òÌè¨ÎåÄÍµê Îã¨ÎπõÎ¨¥ÏßÄÍ∞úÎ∂ÑÏàò)","description":"Banpo Bridge Rainbow Fountain is installed along 570 meters on both sides of Banpodaegyo Bridge, with 380 nozzles spraying water from the river below out into a beautiful show of water, music, and lights.

The structure consists of a main room offering a good view of the whole village, spacious bedrooms, a large garden, and annex buildings. As it withholds the beauty of a traditional hanok while incorporating the modern trend of its time, Baek In-je House is considered to be highly valuable in means of both architecture and history, representing the Bukchon Hanok Village together with Yun Bo-seon House.<br /><br />Baek In-je House was built from black pine, which was first introduced in Seoul during the Gyeongseong Expo in 1907, distinguishing itself from other upper-class houses of its time. Unlike other traditional hanok designs that separate the main building from the other rooms, Baek In-je House connects the two with a hallway, allowing convenient access between the two structures. The house also consists of a Japanese-style hallway and floor mat rooms, reflecting the interior trends of that period. Baek In-je House is also unique in that the main room is partially built as a two-story structure, a style that was never seen in any traditional hanok built during the Joseon period.","regDate":"2022-07-11","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Old Houses"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481892_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-07-11-1657507335227","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Seoul/2022-07-11-1657507335227"},{"id":"2022-07-11-1657494251347","title":"Aqua Planet 63 (ÏïÑÏø†ÏïÑÌîåÎùºÎÑ∑ 63)","description":"Aqua Planet 63 located in 63 Square was opened on July 1, 2016.
