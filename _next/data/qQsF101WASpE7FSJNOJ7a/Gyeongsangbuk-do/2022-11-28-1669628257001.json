According to Samguksagi (Historical records of the Three Kingdoms) and Samgungnyusa (Memorabilia from the three dynasties), Park Hyeokgeose, the founding monarch of Silla, was born by this well. In 69 BC, Sobeolgong, the head of Goheochon Village, saw a white horse on its knees by the well. When he approached the well he found that the horse had magically disappeared and that a large egg was left in its place, from which a boy was born. When the boy turned 13 years old (57 BC), he was appointed king by the village chiefs and began to rule the area then called ‚ÄòSeorabeol‚Äô. A memorial stone (2.25 meters high, 45 centimeters long, and 21 centimeters wide) was erected in 1803 in the third year of King Sunjos rule (Joseon dynasty) detailing the historical origins of the founding father of Silla.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-54-779-6100|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-28-1669628257001/681168_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-28-1669628257001/681168_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-28-1669628257001/681183_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-28-1669628257001/681183_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-54-779-6100](tel:+82547796100)\n- [üè†www.gyeongju.go.kr/tour](http://www.gyeongju.go.kr/tour)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.8159876042\nlongitude: 129.2126238598\ntitle: Tap-dong, Gyeongju-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>\nTake an intercity \nbus to  Gyeongju Bus Terminal.<br><br>From Gyeongju Intercity&nbsp;Bus Terminal or Express \nBus Terminal, take Bus No. 500, 505, 505-1, 506, 507, or 508 and get off at Najeong Entrance or Oreung \nIntersection Bus Stop.<br><br>OR<br><br>Take a taxi for approx. 10 min. to Gyeongju Najeong Well.\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-28-1669628257001","title":"Gyeongju Najeong Well (Í≤ΩÏ£º ÎÇòÏ†ï)","description":"To the southeast of the royal tomb, is a small monument that has been erected among the pine trees; next to the monument is a well called Najeong.
