When Kim Jeongho made the Daedongyeojido Map, he visited this place seven times to confirm this area is in fact the easternmost part of Korea. Following the resources of Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute, the sunrise time of Homigot on January 1 is at 7 32 am, making it the earliest first sunrise of each year in Korea. The plaza was built to commemorate these research findings with the national Sunrise Festival. Nearby attractions include Koreas largest lighthouse, Homigot Lighthouse, established in 1908; Lighthouse Museum; Monument to Commemorate Lee Yuk-sa‚Äôs Patriotism; and Daebo Seawater Bath, using pure seawater of the East Sea. <br><br>When completed, Homigot Tourism Complex and Homigot Specialized Ocean Leisure Complex will be the largest tourism complex in the eastern coast district. It will include an ocean aquarium, Ocean Ecological Park, Youth Training facilities, beach dome, accommodation facilities, and other various stores as well. <br><br> Sangsaeng‚Äôs Hand, a two-part bronze sculpture shaped like a pair of hands, was constructed in December 1999. It is a signature symbol of the sunrise festival. The left hand is on the land and the right hand is in the ocean. It was built to give the message that all people are living together by helping one another like Sangsaeng, meaning coexistence in Korean. The base of the platform is an image of the sun and its two round rings refer to harmony. These two hands have memorial sprits of reconciliation and coexistence for celebrating a new millennium.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-54-270-5855|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-01-1669884185831/682351_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-01-1669884185831/682351_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-01-1669884185831/682359_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-01-1669884185831/682359_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-01-1669884185831/682366_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-01-1669884185831/682366_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-01-1669884185831/682370_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-01-1669884185831/682370_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-01-1669884185831/1700964_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-01-1669884185831/1700964_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-01-1669884185831/2527505_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-01-1669884185831/2527505_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-01-1669884185831/2653332_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-01-1669884185831/2653332_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-01-1669884185831/2653333_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-01-1669884185831/2653333_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-01-1669884185831/2653337_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-01-1669884185831/2653337_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-01-1669884185831/682159_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-01-1669884185831/682159_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-54-270-5855](tel:+82542705855)\n- [üè†homigot.invil.org](http://homigot.invil.org/index.html?menuno=568322&lnb=40106)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.0778398027\nlongitude: 129.5682601461\ntitle: 20, Haemaji-ro 150beon-gil, Nam-gu, Pohang-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Dong Seoul Bus Terminal or Seoul Express Bus Terminal, take a bus to Pohang Bus Terminal.<br>\nFrom Pohang Bus Terminal Bus Stop, take Bus No. 200 and get off at Guryongpo Bus Stop.<br>\nTransfer to Bus No. 203 and get off at Homigot Sunrise Square Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-01-1669884185831","title":"Homigot Sunrise Square (Ìò∏ÎØ∏Í≥∂ Ìï¥ÎßûÏù¥Í¥ëÏû•)","description":"Homigot is located at the easternmost end of the Korean peninsula, in what would be considered to be the tail, if thinking of the Korean peninsula as a tiger.

There are two, three-storied stone pagodas in the heart of Namsan Village and a small, elegant pond to the east. The pond is famous thanks to a Korean legend, written below <br><br>In the 10th year of King Soji (488) of Silla, a crow and a mouse approached the king as he was on his way to Namsan Mountain. The mouse told the King to ‚Äúfollow after the crow‚Äù for an easy journey. So, the King and his servant (who was traveling with him) followed the crow, but became distracted and lost their way. As they were wandering about a pond (now known as Seochulji), an old man appeared from the waters‚Äô depths and presented an envelope to the King. Based on the message in the envelope, the King instructed his servant to fire an arrow at the Geomungo (Korean musical instrument) case nearby. The shot killed the queen and a monk who had been hiding there, both of whom had been hatching a plot against the King. <br><br>The name of the pond, ‚ÄúSeochulji‚Äù (literally meaning ‚Äúwriting from the pond‚Äù) originates from this legend. It is said that a man named Imjeok built a building by the pond in the 5th year of King Hyeonjong (1664) to enjoy the scenery. The simple, yet elegant building still remains at the northwest of the pond.","regDate":"2022-12-05","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Eco-Tourism Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-05-1670215268816/214720_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-05-1670215268816"},{"id":"2022-12-05-1670211454452","title":"Seobyeok Historic House (ÏÑúÎ≤ΩÍ≥†ÌÉù)","description":"Located in Jungpyeong-dong at the family village of the Pyeongsan Sin clan, the Seobyeok Historic House was originally created when Sin Hanchang, a scholar from late Joseon dynasty, got married and moved out of his parents‚Äô house.
