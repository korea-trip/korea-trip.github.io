The tomb features three layers of stones topped by a smooth mound, which is a tomb style originating from the Goguryeo dynasty (37 BC-AD 668). The tombs are presumed to belong to one of the earliest leaders of the Baekje dynasty (18 BC-AD 660), which was founded by the people of Goguryeo who had come down southwards to establish a new kingdom around the Hangang River basin. <br><br>The square-shaped fourth tomb features a structure similar to the third tomb. Many pieces of earthenware from the early Baekje era were found in the fourth tomb. Also excavated around this site was a gold spangle earring.
