{"pageProps":{"content":"![Sorae Marsh Ecological Park (소래습지생태공원)](/2022-08-12-1660304118232/2675544_image2_1.webp)\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> Sorae Marsh Ecological Park is located on a vast plot of land in Incheon. The park first opened in June 1999 at the site of an old saltern on a 660,000 ㎡ plot but has expanded over the years to an area of 3.5 million ㎡. The previous salt storage has been converted into an ecology exhibition space, displaying the history of the area as well as the plants and animals that live here. The park expanded in April 2001 with the addition of the Ecology Hall and Nature Learning Center, offering various educational experience opportunities. The walking paths by the salt storage and the windmill are especially popular photo points. Many people visit in fall for the shimmering silver grass, said to appear in many colors depending on the lighting. The park amenities, including rest areas and benches, make the park a popular destination for families and couples.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-32-435-7076|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|[Ecology Hall] Mondays (closed the following day if Monday is a public holiday), the day following public holidays, New Year’s Day, Seollal (Lunar New Year’s Day) & Chuseok (Lunar New Year’s Day) holidays|\n|usetime:|[Park hours] 04:00-23:00<br>[Trail hours] 09:30-17:30<br>[Ecology Hall] 10:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Pergola, deck, eco experience facilities, marsh, salt field reservoir, exploration trails, convenience store, lounge, bike rental, etc.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-12-1660304118232/2588894_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-12-1660304118232/2588894_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-12-1660304118232/2588895_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-12-1660304118232/2588895_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-12-1660304118232/2588897_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-12-1660304118232/2588897_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-12-1660304118232/2588899_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-12-1660304118232/2588899_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-12-1660304118232/2675547_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-12-1660304118232/2675547_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-12-1660304118232/2675548_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-12-1660304118232/2675548_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-12-1660304118232/2675550_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-12-1660304118232/2675550_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-12-1660304118232/2675552_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-12-1660304118232/2675552_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-12-1660304118232/2675553_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-12-1660304118232/2675553_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-12-1660304118232/2588893_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-12-1660304118232/2588893_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-32-435-7076](tel:+82324357076)\n- [🏠www.incheon.go.kr](https://www.incheon.go.kr/park/park010301)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.4074158153\nlongitude: 126.7463494160\ntitle: 77, Sorae-ro 154beon-gil, Namdong-gu, Incheon\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-12-1660304118232","title":"Sorae Marsh Ecological Park (소래습지생태공원)","description":"Sorae Marsh Ecological Park is located on a vast plot of land in Incheon.
