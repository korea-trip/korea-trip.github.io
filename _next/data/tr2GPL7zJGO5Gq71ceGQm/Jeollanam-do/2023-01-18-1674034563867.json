In autumn, fields of silver grass unfold around the mountain peak, allowing for the Cheongwansan Silver Grass Festival to take place on Yeondaebong (silver grass plain). Also, from the top of the mountain, several grand landmarks like Dadohae archipelago, Wochulsan Mountain and Mudeungsan Mountain in nearby cities can be seen. On a clear day, visitors can even see Hallasan Mountain on Jeju Island.
