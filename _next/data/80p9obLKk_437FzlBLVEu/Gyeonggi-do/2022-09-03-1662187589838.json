Gongneung is the royal tomb of Queen Jangsun (1445-1461), consort of King Yejong, the 8th ruler of the Joseon dynasty. She died when she was still a crown princess, so her tomb is very simple. There is not even a ‚ÄúMangjuseok,‚Äù which is the name for the pair of stones that stand on either side of the mound. <br><br>\nSulleung is the tomb of Queen Gonghye (1456-1474), a consort of King Seongjong, the 9th ruler of the Joseon dynasty. Sulleung is similar to Gongneung in many ways, but it has more stonework. Queen Gonghye was the 4th daughter of Han Myeong-Hoe, a high-ranking government officer, and a sister of Queen Jangsun, who is buried in Gongneung. This was the only time in the history of the Joseon dynasty that two sisters both became queen.<br><br>\nYeongneung is the tomb of the posthumously designated king, King Jinjong (1719-1728), the first son of King Yeongjo, and Queen Hyosun (1715-1751). King Jinjong became the crown prince at the age of 7, but he died when he was only 13 in Changgyeonggung Palace. Queen Hyosun became the crown princess when she was 13 years old. In 1751, she died at the age of 37 without an heir.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-31-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-31-941-4208|\n|parking:|Available (42 parking spaces, small vehicles 35, large vehicles 7)|\n|restdate:|Mondays|\n|usetime:|February-May, September-October 09:00-18:00 <br>June-August 09:00-18:30 <br>November-January 09:00-17:30 <br>* Last ticketing 1 hour before closing|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Rest area, drinking fountain, bicycle rack|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|[International visitors]<br>Individuals - Adults 1,000 won / Children 500 won<br>Groups - Adults 800 won / Children 400 won<br> <br> * Adults (ages 19-64) / Children (ages 7-18)<br>* Groups: 10 or more people <br>* Free admission: Preschoolers (ages 6 & younger), senior citizens (ages 65 & older) <br> <br> [Hourly / Lunch / Day Pass] <br> Hourly Pass : Valid for 1 year <br> Lunch: 12:00-13:00<br> - Fee: 30,000 won <br> Lunch Pass: Valid for 3 months (10 times) <br> - Entry : 12:00-14:00 (Admission Time: 12:00-13:00) <br> - Fee: 3,000 won <br> Day Pass: Valid for 1 month <br> - Entry : Anytime during the operating hours. <br> - Fee: 10,000 won|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Not available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-09-03-1662187589838/1593604_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-03-1662187589838/1593604_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-03-1662187589838/1593606_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-03-1662187589838/1593606_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-03-1662187589838/1593607_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-03-1662187589838/1593607_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-03-1662187589838/1593608_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-03-1662187589838/1593608_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-31-941-4208](tel:+82319414208)\n- [üè†royaltombs.cha.go.kr](http://royaltombs.cha.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.7471166613\nlongitude: 126.8288823384\ntitle: 89, Samneung-ro, Paju-si, Gyeonggi-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-09-03-1662187589838","title":"Paju Three Royal Tombs [UNESCO World Heritage] (ÌååÏ£º ÏÇºÎ¶â [Ïú†ÎÑ§Ïä§ÏΩî ÏÑ∏Í≥ÑÎ¨∏ÌôîÏú†ÏÇ∞])","description":"Paju Three Royal Tombs consists of the Gongneung, Sulleung, and Yeongneung tombs.

The mountain‚Äôs slope is steep and stones used in the construction of the fortress walls are scattered here and there at the summit. These scattered stones are evidence that the fortress underwent repairs several times during the Samguk (Three Kingdoms) era and the Joseon dynasty, as these stones were evidently quarried and used to mend the fortress walls. Excavations have discovered a great deal of earthenware, white porcelain, tile, and iron arrowheads. Topographically, the fortress sits on a prime strategic junction and the Unification Observatory has been situated there as well. The fortress stands as an important object of study concerning fortifications and structures from the Baekje dynasty. It has been recorded on the stele of King Gwanggaeto, Samguksagi (History of the Three Kingdoms), in the Naekjebongi (Baekje Annals) and on Daedongyeojido (Map of Korea) that the fortress was the Gwanmi Fortress of Baekje, attracting many scholars and researchers interested in this period.","regDate":"2022-09-02","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Fortresses"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-02-1662104566709/188812_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-09-02-1662104566709","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Gyeonggi-do/2022-09-02-1662104566709"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
