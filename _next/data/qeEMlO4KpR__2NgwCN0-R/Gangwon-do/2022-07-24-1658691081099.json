The source water originates from the Misiryeong Valley of Taebaek Mountain Range and flows to the Cheongchocheon Stream and to this beautiful lake, and then continues to the adjacent sea. So, the lake is an intermediate stop between the river and the sea. Cheongchojeong Pavilion is located above the lake, offering an open view of Seoraksan Mountain and the East Sea. As it is situated at the end of the 75 m-long ocean bridge, you will feel standing in the middle of the lake and enjoy a panoramic view of the lake. Shining more at night, this pavilion is regarded as the best attraction for the beautiful night view in Sokcho. It also attracts visitors’ attraction with its sculptures of the blue and yellow dragons, which were established based on the local legend associated with Cheongchoho Lake. The trail built around the lakeside is equipped with a nighttime lighting system so that many people visit it at night and the benches for rest and appreciating the view. There are many attractions around the lake, such as Seokbong Ceramic Museum, bird sanctuary, etc. The Cheongchoho Lake Park was the venue of the International Travel Expo ’99 Kangwon and is known for its 73.4 m high Expo Tower Observatory.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|expagerange:|Open to visitors of all ages|\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-33-639-2690|\n|parking:|Available (120 spaces)|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Open 24 hr|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free of charge|\n|Available Facilities:|Observatory, walking path, park, Cheongchoho Lake Gaetbae (boat), restaurant, cafe, etc.|\n|Activity Fees:|Free of charge|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-24-1658691081099/2607670_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658691081099/2607670_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658691081099/2607671_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658691081099/2607671_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658691081099/2653900_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658691081099/2653900_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658691081099/2711159_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658691081099/2711159_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658691081099/2711160_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658691081099/2711160_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658691081099/2711162_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658691081099/2711162_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658691081099/2711163_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658691081099/2711163_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658691081099/2711164_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658691081099/2711164_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-33-639-2690](tel:+82336392690)\n- [🏠www.sokchotour.com</a><br><a href=\"http://chungchoho.co.kr/\" target=\"_blank\">chungchoho.co.kr](http://www.sokchotour.com/tour/destination/nature)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 38.1963805690\nlongitude: 128.5904917166\ntitle: Cheongchohoban-ro, Sokcho-si, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-24-1658691081099","title":"Cheongchoho Lake (청초호)","description":"Cheongchoho Lake, located in the center of Sokcho city, is a large natural lake with a circumference of 5 m and an area of 1.3 km2.

The flood control dam has proved its worth during the floods of 1995, 1996, and 1999 and it has become a major tourist destination over the years. Located in the vicinity of Peace Dam is Bimok Park, which is the origin of the famous national song “Bimok.”<br><br>In addition to the war monuments inside the park, there are around a dozen wooden crosses with rusty iron helmets placed on top within the barbed wire entanglements around the hill, thereby reminding visitors of the national tragedy of the Korean War. The county of Hwancheon hosts the Bimok Cultural Festival from June 3 to June 6 every year at Bimok Park, Bungeoseom Island by the town’s riverside, and the surrounding areas. The four-day festival offers a variety of events such as a singing contest, memorial ceremony of poetry reading, bimok tree cutting contest, rice ball eating contest, army life experience, military music parade, and more. <br><br>Crossing over to Yanggu County from Peace Dam, there is a national security education place comprised of attractions like the 4th Underground Tunnel and Eulji Observatory. Paroho Lake Battlefield Tourist Park is also worth a visit after looking around Peace Dam. Also known as the “ocean within mountains,” Paroho is a manmade lake created as a result of the Hwacheon Dam construction in 1944. The lake is home to over 70 different species of freshwater fish such as mandarin fish and carp. It also holds the sorrowful history of the water burial of three whole divisions of the Chinese Forces in defending the lake during the Korean War. The name Paroho, meaning “enemy breaking lake,” was given after the late president of Korea, Rhee Syngman, visited the place and designated a plaque in his own handwriting in memory of obtaining victory in fierce battle. There is an observatory, a security hall, and a stone monument engraved with the poetry of Wolha Rhee Taegeuk (1913-2003).","regDate":"2022-09-29","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-29-1664445054593/172387_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-09-29-1664445054593"},{"id":"2022-09-29-1664441824591","title":"Hwaamdonggul Cave [Gangwon Paleozoic Geopark] (화암동굴 (강원고생대 국가지질공원))","description":"Hwaamdonggul Cave was originally a gold mine that was commercially operated from 1922 to 1945 as the nation’s fifth largest gold mine.
