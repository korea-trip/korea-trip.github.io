The third peak is the highest, standing at 362 meters with a beautiful view and crisp air, making it ideal for hiking (3-hour course) and resting at the top.

Around 600 items were discovered along with the prayer, including unbleached ramie cloth, a short-sleeved gown, rice, and barley. Munsunsa has the tranquil atmosphere of a mountain temple.
