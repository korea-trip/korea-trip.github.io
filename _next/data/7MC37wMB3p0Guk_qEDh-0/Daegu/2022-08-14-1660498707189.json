It is said that the dish was first offered as an affordable dish to accompany drinks, favored by blue-collar laborers who gathered at the early labor market in front of Pyeonghwa Market in the 1970s. Rather than being pan-fried, chicken gizzard is deep-fried like chicken meat. Inexpensive and delicious, the dish has remained popular. Dakddongjip Town was designated the third \"Good Street” by the Community Chest of Korea, a network of governing bodies that run a philanthropic organization. The Good Street designation is given to the streets where storekeepers subscribe to the Community Chest of Korea’s Good Street campaign to share good deeds.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)|\n|parking:|Paid parking lot inside of Pyeonghwa Market|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-14-1660498707189/1835958_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-14-1660498707189/1835958_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-14-1660498707189/1929303_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-14-1660498707189/1929303_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-14-1660498707189/1929304_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-14-1660498707189/1929304_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-14-1660498707189/1929306_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-14-1660498707189/1929306_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-14-1660498707189/1929307_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-14-1660498707189/1929307_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-14-1660498707189/1929308_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-14-1660498707189/1929308_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-14-1660498707189/1929314_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-14-1660498707189/1929314_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-14-1660498707189/2020462_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-14-1660498707189/2020462_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-14-1660498707189/2020464_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-14-1660498707189/2020464_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-14-1660498707189/1835950_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-14-1660498707189/1835950_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-2-1330](tel:+8221330)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.8833661337\nlongitude: 128.6192824239\ntitle: 10, Ayang-ro 9-gil, Dong-gu, Daegu\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Train]<br>\nTake a train from Seoul Station to Dongdaegu Station.<br><br>\n\n[Express/Intercity Bus]<br>\nFrom Seoul Express Bus Terminal, take an express bus bound for Dong Daegu Express Bus Terminal.<br><br>\n\n[Local Bus]<br>\nGet on Express 1, Circular Line 2-1, 156, 401, 414-1, 521, 618, 708, 808, 980, Dong-gu 3 or Palgong 1. <br>\nGet off in front of Pyeonghwa Market.\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-14-1660498707189","title":"Dakddongjip Town in Pyeonghwa Market (대구 평화시장 닭똥집 골목)","description":"Dakddongjip Town in Pyeonghwa Market was established in 1972, and is a street specializing in chicken gizzard dishes.

It was built by Monk Geukdal in the 15th year of King Soji’s reign (AD 493). The original name of the temple was Yugasa Temple, but Simjiwangsa rebuilt the temple under King Heungdeok (r. AD 826-836) and named it Donghwasa Temple, which means even during the winter season, the paulownia tree still blooms. The present temple was built in 1732. <Br><br>When you turn the corner, the first thing that catches your eye is the Seolbeopjeon Hall. To the left of Seolbeopjeon is Daeungjeon Hall, the main building, and a path to the right leads to Geumgang Stairs. If you turn left in the direction of Daeungjeon you will see Bongseoru Pavilion, aptly named to signify a phoenix (bonghwang in Korean) with its tail pointed downward. Past Bongseoru are stairs that are typical of the ones leading into Daeungjeon, called Nugak Stairs. On either side of the stairs are railings in the shape of a dragon, and in the middle of the stairs, there is a round stone marble that resembles a dragon orb, a ball often associated with dragons.  <br><Br>Donghwasa’s Daeungjeon is segmented into 3 sections at the front and side, and its natural looking pillars are one of its main attractions. It includes the statues of Seokgamonibul, Amitabul, and Yaksayeoraebul inside. If you walk down the stone stairs beside Bongseoru and walk along the cement road for a while, you will find the huge Seokjoyaksa Yeoraebul. Created as a prayer for reunification, this large Buddha statue is 17m high. The stone tower, stone light,  lion statue, and the lotus flower that decorate the Buddha statue are all very large in size. Behind the statue are also stones arranged in a circular form, resembling a beautiful scroll painting. These are world-class size stone artifacts.","regDate":"2022-08-14","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Daegu","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-14-1660505722333/1574183_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Daegu/2022-08-14-1660505722333"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
