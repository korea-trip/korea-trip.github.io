It was often referred to as Sugumun Gate (water channel gate) and was actually used as a Sigumun, literally meaning ‚Äúcorpse gate,‚Äù as funeral processions passed through this gate when exiting to the east.  \n<br><br>\nDuring the Imjin War (1592-1598), the fortress gate was destroyed to such a degree that it made finding the original location close to impossible.  Nevertheless, reconstruction efforts were started in 1711 (37th year of King Sukjong) and the gate was restored together with the gate's watchtower. Gwanghuimun Gate remained intact even when the fortress walls were demolished to build tram tracks during the Japanese occupation, but it was later damaged during the Korean War and left neglected. In 1975, restoration work was carried out to relocate Gwanghuimun Gate to a site 15 meters south of its original location since it stood in the middle of the road.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-2-3700-3900,<BR> +82-2-3700-3901, <BR> +82-2-3396-5842|\n|parking:|Not available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Open 24 hr|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Restrooms:|Not available|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Not available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-23-1658575967064/1568497_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658575967064/1568497_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658575967064/1568498_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658575967064/1568498_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658575967064/1568499_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658575967064/1568499_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658575967064/1568500_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658575967064/1568500_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658575967064/1568501_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658575967064/1568501_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658575967064/1568503_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658575967064/1568503_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658575967064/2526455_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658575967064/2526455_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658575967064/2526456_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658575967064/2526456_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658575967064/2526457_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658575967064/2526457_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658575967064/2526458_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658575967064/2526458_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-2-3700-3900](tel:+82237003900)\n- [üè†www.junggu.seoul.kr](http://www.junggu.seoul.kr/tour/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5643772800\nlongitude: 127.0096987947\ntitle: 344, Toegye-ro, Jung-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway]<br>\nDongdaemun History & Culture Park Station (Seoul Subway Line 2, 4, 5), Exit 3. <br>\nGate is across the street to the right.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-23-1658575967064","title":"Gwanghuimun Gate (Í¥ëÌù¨Î¨∏)","description":"Gwanghuimun Gate is said to have been originally constructed in 1396, the 5th year of King Taejo, at the southeast of the capital city.
