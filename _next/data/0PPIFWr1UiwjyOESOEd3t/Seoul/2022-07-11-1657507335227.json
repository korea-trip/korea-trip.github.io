The structure consists of a main room offering a good view of the whole village, spacious bedrooms, a large garden, and annex buildings. As it withholds the beauty of a traditional hanok while incorporating the modern trend of its time, Baek In-je House is considered to be highly valuable in means of both architecture and history, representing the Bukchon Hanok Village together with Yun Bo-seon House.<br /><br />Baek In-je House was built from black pine, which was first introduced in Seoul during the Gyeongseong Expo in 1907, distinguishing itself from other upper-class houses of its time. Unlike other traditional hanok designs that separate the main building from the other rooms, Baek In-je House connects the two with a hallway, allowing convenient access between the two structures. The house also consists of a Japanese-style hallway and floor mat rooms, reflecting the interior trends of that period. Baek In-je House is also unique in that the main room is partially built as a two-story structure, a style that was never seen in any traditional hanok built during the Joseon period.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|accomcount:|100 people|\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-2-724-0200|\n|restdate:|Mondays (open in the case of Monday is a public holiday), New Year's Day|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00 (Last admission 17:30)<br />* Outdoor facility accessible during free viewing time <br />* Indoor areas off limits|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Reservation & on-site registration available for guided tours<br> Schedule: 16:00 (Wednesdays - Japanese / Thursdays - Chinese / Fridays - English)<br><br> * Elementary students and younger children must be accompanied by an adult.<br>* Call +82-2-724-0232 for cancellations. <br>* Reservation canceled if more than 10 min late|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481870_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481870_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481871_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481871_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481872_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481872_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481874_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481874_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481877_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481877_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481878_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481878_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481879_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481879_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481880_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481880_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481890_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481890_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-2-724-0200](tel:+8227240200)\n- [üè†www.museum.seoul.kr](http://www.museum.seoul.kr/www/intro/annexIntro/annex_22/annex_22_01.jsp?sso=ok)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5804416194\nlongitude: 126.9840701194\ntitle: 16, Bukchon-ro 7-gil, Jongno-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-11-1657507335227","title":"Baek In-je House (Î∞±Ïù∏Ï†úÍ∞ÄÏò•)","description":"Baek In-je House in Gahoe-dong, located in Bukchon Hanok Village, is a hanok built during the Japanese administration period that portrays modern hanok features.
