You can put your money in the bank for your next visit or purchase goods at the department store. In order to make the environment as realistic as possible, every building, car, and tree is reduced to 2/3 its real size, helping children feel more adult-like in their new world! Kidzania mimics a real city environment, has diverse jobs, and is full of events. When there is a fire, a fireman rushes to help, and a news reporter covers the story. While 911 paramedics give first aid to fire victims, in another part of ‚Äútown‚Äù delivery personnel are dropping off packages. Kidzania teaches the next generation how to live as responsible members of society and gives them an introduction to how the economy works.","regDate":"2022-08-04","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Experience Programs","Unique Experience"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-04-1659656133025/2031380_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-08-04-1659656133025"},{"id":"2022-08-04-1659652608116","title":"KT Square (KTÏä§ÌÄòÏñ¥)","description":"KT Square is a multi-complex that offers various cultural performances as well as hands-on experiences of the latest in IT technology.
