The tale is about a dragon that emerged from the east sea along with his seven sons at the end of the Silla Kingdom (57BC - 935AD). One of the dragon’s sons named Cheoyong came to the capital and married a beautiful woman. One night, he found an evil spirit trying to attack his wife so he sang and danced, whereupon the spirit presented itself and kneeled in apology. Since then, people have used the image of Cheoyong to dispel evil spirits. <br><br>The dance that Cheoyong is said to have performed has been titled Cheoyongmu and has been designated as an Important Intangible Cultural Property. Cheoyongam is the sacred rock where the dragon in the tale is said to have appeared. There are many attractions nearby including Mokdo Island (Natural Monument No. 65), which offers magnificent lush greenery all year round.","regDate":"2022-08-21","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Ulsan","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Ulsan/2022-08-21-1661071406943"},{"id":"2022-08-21-1661067433126","title":"Ulsandaegyo Observatory (울산대교 전망대)","description":"At the x_height of 63 meters on top of Hwajeongsan Mountain (alt. 203 meters), Ulsandaegyo Observatory offers a breathtaking view of Ulsandaegyo Bridge as well as the city's three major industry complexes and beautiful mountains.
