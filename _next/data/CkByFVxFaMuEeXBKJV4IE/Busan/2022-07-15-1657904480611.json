It was formed after the independence of Korea (August 15) as a residential area in the empty place where the previous Gukje Market was demolished. Book stores began opening one-by-one and soon the street became known as Bosu-dong Book Street. The street is popular amongst booklovers for their used books as well as new books, and amongst travelers for the street’s unique atmosphere. Many young adults also frequent the street because there are many specialty shops for comic books. Every year, the Bosu-dong Culture Festival takes place and visitors can participate in events such as, make-your-own book cover, make-your-own book, and so on.

However, major renovations took place ahead of the first Busan International Film Festival (BIFF), and the newly transformed district was named BIFF Square on August 14, 1996.<br><br> Having been remade into a&nbsp;cultural tourist attraction promoting the advancement of Korea’s film industry, BIFF Square has contributed to Busan’s newfound status as an international cultural tourist city. The 428 meter-long street stretching from the Buyeong Theater in Nampo-dong to the overpass in Chungmu-dong was divided into “Star Street” and “Festival Street,” and on the eve of the festival each year the “BIFF Square Ground Opening” is held on the street. During the ceremony, events such as the hand printing of famous movie celebrities and Nunggot Jeomdeung (snow-flower lighting) take place. A district such as BIFF Square, crowded with first-run theaters in a city is rare not only in Asia but Europe as well, and for this reason it holds great potential. In recent years, the square has grown into a more complex area, featuring not only movie theaters but also shops and leisure facilities, attracting growing numbers of young visitors and tourists.","regDate":"2022-07-15","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Busan","Culture/Art/History","Experience Programs","Cultural Districts"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-15-1657864539142/2364283_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Busan/2022-07-15-1657864539142","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Busan/2022-07-15-1657864539142"}],"navList":["Busan","Daegu","Daejeon","Gwangju","Incheon","Seoul"]},"__N_SSG":true}
