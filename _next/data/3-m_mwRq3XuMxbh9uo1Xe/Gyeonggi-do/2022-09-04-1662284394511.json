Meaning “lake as clear as a mountain well,” Sanjeonghosu Lake was built as a reservoir to supply water to farmlands in 1925. Thanks to its surrounding attractions, the lake brings many visitors each year. Promenades along the lake are popular for couples as well as tourists who stay in the nearby hotels. <br><br>\n\nBeautiful fog often rises from the lake in spring and fall, making boating at night quite picturesque. Hikers frequent Myeongseongsan Mountain in spring and fall. Visitors love skating on the lake in winter. The lake is also surrounded by an amusement park, swimming pools, sledding facilities, and spa amenities, attracting many family visitors. Local restaurants are renowned for their delicious, wholesome dishes made using freshwater snails and mushrooms. Other local favorites include <em>maeuntang</em> (spicy fish stew), <em>dotorimuk</em> (acorn jelly), <em>sanchae baekban</em> (Korean set menu with seasoned wild vegetables), and <em>deodeok gui</em> (grilled bonnet bellflower roots).\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-31-532-6135|\n|parking:|Available|\n|usetime:|N/A (open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Night-time Hike Restriction Notice:|Admission is strictly prohibited from sunset until 2 hours before sunrise for visitors’ safety and natural environment protection.|\n|Areas Open to the Public:|Sanjeonghosu Lake Tourist Site<br>Myeongseongsan Mountain trekking trails|\n|Hiking Course:|[Myeongseongsan Mountain] <br>Course 1: Sangdong Parking Lot > Biseon Falls > Deungryong Falls > Reed Field > Palgakjeong Pavilion > Mountain Top <br>Course 2: Sangdong Parking Lot > Biseon Falls > Chaekbawi Rock > Palgakjeong Pavilion > Mountain Top<br>Course 3: Jainsa Temple > Stone Stairs > Parting ways > Wooden Stairs > Palgakjeong Pavilion > Mountain Top<br>Course 4: Sanangogae Hill > Valley > Branch Ridge (left side) > Mountain Top|\n|Available Facilities:|* Sports Facilities – boatyard, sledding facilities, amusement park, skating rink<br>* Amenities – picnic grounds<br>* Special facilities- sculpture park|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Small vehicles: 2,000 won <br>Mid-sized vehicles: 5,000 won<br>Large vehicles: 10,000 won|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Not available|\n|Korean Info.

The mountain was also called bulgyeon, which means “seeing Buddha,” as it was said that a member of the royal family had a vision of the Buddha while praying at the temple. The temple used to be larger, maintaining 36 buildings on the premises and 132 hermitages spread over the mountain, but these facilities were completely destroyed during the Japanese invasions of Korea from 1592-1598 and the Korean War from 1950-1953. The temple that stands today was reconstructed in 1955. The road leading to the entrance of Surisa Temple offers gorgeous scenery with a beautiful forest and valley lining its sides; it is as if the mountain itself surrounds the temple like a painted screen.","regDate":"2022-09-08","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-08-1662626904896/1252700_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-09-08-1662626904896"},{"id":"2022-09-08-1662623445837","title":"Supullo Unsimni (수풀로 운심리)","description":"Opened in 2004, Supullo Unsimni is situated on the Namhangang Riverside. The site used to be a sandpit before it was turned into a wetland.  Effluent from wastewater treatment plants, which in the past was released directly into the Hangang River, now passes through several ponds with various aquatic plants and a one kilometer-long waterway so that it can be naturally purified.  This has contributed to an improvement in the water quality of the Hangang River. The center was built to restore the Namhangang Riverside area, which was destroyed due to sand extraction, and to restore its natural ecology of willow trees, reeds, and birds. The center organizes a number of ecological excursion programs for children.","regDate":"2022-09-08","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Eco-Tourism Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-08-1662623445837/1099393_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-09-08-1662623445837"},{"id":"2022-09-08-1662620770343","title":"Sujongsa Temple (수종사)","description":"Sujongsa Temple is a branch temple of Bongseonsa Temple, located near the top of Ungilsan Mountain.
