Built in the Madubong Hill area, this location where Hamchunwon, the outer garden of Changgyeonggung Palace, once stood in 1484 (15th year of King Seongjong), was also once the site of Gyeongmogung Palace, where King Jeongjo enshrined the mortuary tablet of his birth father Crown Prince Sado Seja in 1776 (the year King Jeongjo ascended to the throne). <br><br>These places that held importance for the royal family were destroyed as the Japanese built Gyeongseong Empire University in its place. In 1907, with the announcement of the plan to establish Daehan Medical Center, construction began on the main building, seven wards and affiliated buildings.  Construction was completed in November 1908. <br><br>The Daehan Medical Center opened in Gwangjewon, but upon Japanese colonization in 1910, its name was changed to the Japanese Viceroyalty Hospital. In 1926, it was included as a part of Gyeongseongjeguk University to become a university hospital. Since the liberation of Korea in 1945, it has been a hospital affiliated with Seoul National University.","regDate":"2022-08-08","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-08-1659994648083/1554829_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-08-08-1659994648083"},{"id":"2022-08-08-1659991172318","title":"Seoul Color Park (ÏÑúÏö∏ÏÉâÍ≥µÏõê)","description":"The Seoul Color Park spans over 9,000 „é° of land next to the Hangang River under Mapodaegyo Bridge.
