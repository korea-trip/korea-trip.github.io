Geungnakjeon Hall can be seen after passing through Sacheonwangmun Gate, recognizably the best location for taking in the beauty of Muryangsa Temple. The temple grounds hold the Two-story Geungnakjeon Hall, Five-story Stone Pagoda, and Stone Lantern, all in a row. <br><br>The temple is also famous for being the place where Kim Siseup, one of the Saengyuksin (Six Loyal Subjects of the Joseon dynasty), spent his last few days before death. Visitors can see his portrait inside the temple. Although the temple site is included in Buyeo-gun’s administrative district, it is located closer to downtown Boryeong.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<BR>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-41-836-5066|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|Adults - Individuals 3,000 won / Groups 2,500 won<br>Teenagers - Individuals 1,500 won / Groups 1,000 won<br>Children - Individuals 1,000 won / Groups 500 won<br><br>* Seniors citizens (ages 65 and over) are eligible for free admission.|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-02-1667368710012/2037206_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-02-1667368710012/2037206_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-02-1667368710012/2037208_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-02-1667368710012/2037208_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-02-1667368710012/2037218_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-02-1667368710012/2037218_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-02-1667368710012/2037219_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-02-1667368710012/2037219_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-02-1667368710012/2654417_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-02-1667368710012/2654417_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-02-1667368710012/2654418_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-02-1667368710012/2654418_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-02-1667368710012/2654419_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-02-1667368710012/2654419_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-02-1667368710012/2654420_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-02-1667368710012/2654420_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-41-836-5066](tel:+82418365066)\n- [🏠www.muryangsa.net](https://www.muryangsa.net/category/%ED%85%9C%ED%94%8C%EC%8A%A4%ED%85%8C%EC%9D%B4%20%EC%95%88%EB%82%B4)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.3172101068\nlongitude: 126.6930115011\ntitle: 203, Muryang-ro, Buyeo-gun, Chungcheongnam-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-02-1667368710012","title":"Buyeo Muryangsa Temple (무량사(부여))","description":"Muryangsa Temple, located at the foot of Mansusan Mountain in Buyeo-gun, Chungcheongnam-do, is said to have been built during the reign of Silla King Munmu by national preceptor Beomil.

While the outer wall is sharply sloped, the inner wall was built with a gentle slope to make it easier for horses to reach the guard posts on the top of the wall. Inside the fortress, the palace of Baekje, government offices, houses, temples, stores and protected facilities can be seen. The entire structure of Naseong Fortress features Geumgang River in the south and west sides, providing a natural double-defense system.
