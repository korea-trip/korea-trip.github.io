Dosanseodang area consists of living quarters and lecture halls where Toegye Yi Hwang, an eminent Confucian scholar, lived and taught his students. Dosanseowon was built after Toegye Yi Hwang passed away by his followers in legacy of his teachings as well as to pay respects to the deceased. <br><br>Built in 1561, Dosanseodang lecture hall is the oldest building in the whole complex. It was personally designed by Yi Hwang, penname Toegye, to further his studies while educating future scholars after moving to the countryside. Living quarters used as a student dormitory were also built along with the lecture hall. <br><br>Dosanseowon compound was completed in 1576, six years after Yi Hwangs death. Yi Hwangs ancestral tablet was enshrined inside Sangdeoksa Shrine (Treasure No. 211) in 1572. Two years later, Jeongyodang Lecture Hall (Treasure No. 210) was built to relocate the tablet and with the addition of buildings to the halls east and west, the area became a seowon. In 1575, the establishment was bestowed a royal charter and a plaque with the name Dosanseowon written by Han Seok-bong, and became the Confucian academy headquarters in the Yeongnam region.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢For more info +82-54-840-6599|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Summer 09:00-18:00<br>Winter 09:00-17:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals ‚Äì Adults 1,500 won / Teenagers 700 won / Children 600 won<br> Groups ‚Äì Adults 1,300 won / Teenagers 600 won / Children 500 won<br><br>* Groups - 30 people or more<BR> * Adults (ages 20 and older)|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Available in English (advance inquiry required)|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-11-1670733665757/2620848_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-11-1670733665757/2620848_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-11-1670733665757/2620850_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-11-1670733665757/2620850_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-11-1670733665757/2620851_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-11-1670733665757/2620851_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-11-1670733665757/2620852_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-11-1670733665757/2620852_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-11-1670733665757/2635199_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-11-1670733665757/2635199_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-11-1670733665757/2635201_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-11-1670733665757/2635201_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-11-1670733665757/2622281_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-11-1670733665757/2622281_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-54-840-6599](tel:+82548406599)\n- [üè†www.dosanseowon.com](http://www.dosanseowon.com/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.7270437877\nlongitude: 128.8425024340\ntitle: 154, Dosanseowon-gil, Andong-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-11-1670733665757","title":"Dosanseowon Confucian Academy [UNESCO World Heritage] (ÎèÑÏÇ∞ÏÑúÏõê [Ïú†ÎÑ§Ïä§ÏΩî ÏÑ∏Í≥ÑÎ¨∏ÌôîÏú†ÏÇ∞])","description":"In terms of architecture, Dosanseowon Confucian Academy complex can largely be divided into Dosanseodang compound and Dosanseowon compound.
