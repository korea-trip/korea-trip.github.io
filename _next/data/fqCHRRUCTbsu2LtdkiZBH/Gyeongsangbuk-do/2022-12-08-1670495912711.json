Unmunsan Mountain features dense groves, attracting a large number of hikers. From the summit, one can get a great view of the golden reeds on Cheonhwangsan Mountain to the south, and the ridges of Gajisan Mountain to the east. <br /><br />There are various sized temples and hermitages on the mountain, nestled among a splendid landscape. Unmunsa Temple is situated at the foot of the mountain on the northern side. It was built by Sinseung in the 18th year of the reign of King Jinheung (557) of the Silla Kingdom. Though some buildings burned down during the Imjin War, the Obaengnahanjeon Hall and Gwaneumjeon Hall have been preserved in their original state. The dense groves of pine trees and fir trees add to the tranquility of the beautiful scenery. In the temple, seven treasures are kept, including the Stone Lantern at Geumdang Hall (Treasure). The historic relics date back to the Silla kingdom and Goryeo dynasty.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-54-370-6114|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|* Closed during adverse weather condition|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Natural Preservation Areas (closed to public):|Section above Unmunsa Temple|\n|Mountain Not Access Period:|Seasonal Forest Fire Watches<br>Spring: February 1 - May 15 <br>Autumn: November 1-December 15<br* Periods and areas are subject to change based on fire weather advisories, snow/precipitation levels, and other local conditions.|\n|Restricted Mountain Areas :|[Refer to the website](http://hiking.kworks.co.kr/sub_map/map_user01.aspx)|\n|Hiking Course:|[Course 1] Sariam Hermitage Parking Lot - Simsim Valley - Araetjae Pass - Summit (Restricted access as a Natural Preservation Area)<br /><br>[Course 2] Motgol Cave - Cheonmunjigol Cave - Ttakbal Ridge - Summit (Restricted access as a Natural Preservation Area)<br /><br>[Course 3] Unmunryeong - Ssalbawi Rock - Gajisan Summit - Araetjae Pass - Summit|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-08-1670495912711/1130187_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-08-1670495912711/1130187_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-08-1670495912711/1130200_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-08-1670495912711/1130200_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-08-1670495912711/1130202_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-08-1670495912711/1130202_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-08-1670495912711/1130204_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-08-1670495912711/1130204_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-54-370-6114](tel:+82543706114)\n- [🏠www.cheongdo.go.kr](http://www.cheongdo.go.kr/open.content/tour/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.6158113858\nlongitude: 128.9806470397\ntitle: Unmun-myeon, Cheongdo-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-08-1670495912711","title":"Unmunsan County Park (운문산군립공원)","description":"Unmunsan Mountain (1,118 meters) is one of the seven mountains rising over 1,000 meters above sea level in the Yeongnam Alps in the Taebaeksanmaek Mountain Range.
