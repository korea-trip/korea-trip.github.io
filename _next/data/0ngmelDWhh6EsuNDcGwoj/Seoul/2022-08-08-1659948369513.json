It was used to imprison thousands of Korean independence activists until the liberation from the Japanese occupation on August 15, 1945, as well as the political prisoners during the political turmoil in the 1960s. When the prison was moved to Uiwang-si, Gyeonggi-do in November 1987, the area was restored and turned into a memorial park in August 15, 1992  to honor the sacrifices of the martyrs. The park preserves seven prison buildings, an execution ground, underground women’s prison, and the March 1st Movement Monument that has been moved from Tapgol Park in Jongno.<br><br>\nOne of the most significant monuments of the Seodaemun Independence Park is Dongnimmun Gate (Independence Gate), which has been designated a Historic Site. Nearby is Dongnipgwan (Independence Hall), originally called Mohwagwan, which was used to greet Chinese envoys during the Joseon dynasty. Today, the hall enshrines 2,327 tablets inscribed with the names of Koreans who died for the cause of national independence. Standing right next to Dongnimmun Gate are the remnants of Yeongeunmun Gate, another Historic Site. Other sights inside the park include the Patriotic Martyr Monument, Declaration of Independence Monument, and Statue of Dr. Seo Jae-pil, who was an independence activist and publisher of Korea’s first independent newspaper. The main highlight of the park is the Seodaemun Prison History Hall, a former prison building that was renovated into a history museum.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-2-3140-8305|\n|opendate:|August 15, 1992|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Open 24 hours|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Visitors center (management office), Patriotic Martyr Monument, Statue of Dr. Seo Jae-pil, Dongnipgwan (Independence Hall), Declaration of Independence Monument, Dongnimmun Gate, Seodaemun Prison History Hall, Lee Jina Memorial Library|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Not available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-08-1659948369513/2413908_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-08-1659948369513/2413908_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-08-1659948369513/2413913_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-08-1659948369513/2413913_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-08-1659948369513/2413924_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-08-1659948369513/2413924_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-08-1659948369513/2413935_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-08-1659948369513/2413935_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-08-1659948369513/2413944_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-08-1659948369513/2413944_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-08-1659948369513/2413949_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-08-1659948369513/2413949_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-08-1659948369513/2413950_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-08-1659948369513/2413950_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-08-1659948369513/2413956_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-08-1659948369513/2413956_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-2-3140-8305](tel:+82231408305)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5766554381\nlongitude: 126.9556450402\ntitle: 251, Tongil-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-08-1659948369513","title":"Seodaemun Independence Park (서대문독립공원)","description":"Seodaemun Independence Park was built on the former Seoul Detention Camp.

At that time, each restaurant had its own DJ booth, with the image of the 'cool DJ' who played the music becoming a symbol of Sindang-dong Tteokbokki Town. In addition, this period also marked the prime time of high school baseball where students would crowd the streets on days when Duksoo Commercial High School and Sunrin Commercial High School (now Sunrin Internet High School) played against one another. Although these high school students have aged, they continue to visit the area, reliving their youth and continuing to indulge in the specialty tteokbokki.<br><br>However, some claim the history of this alley began in the 1950s. The owner of Mabongnim Halmeoni Tteokbokki restaurant says tteokbokki was being sold as early as 1953 as the area used to be home to Donga Theater and she sold tteokbokki, corn and potatoes to those visiting the theater. At first, tteokbokki was simply made with gochu jang but as time went by, cooks decided the dish could be more than just a snack. By adding ingredients like eggs, cellophane noodles, fish cakes, instant noodles and more recently squid, prawn and cheese, tteokbokki can be made more delicious and turns this beloved snack into a full meal.","regDate":"2022-08-09","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Experience Programs","Cultural Districts"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-09-1660073871723/2660049_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-08-09-1660073871723"},{"id":"2022-08-09-1660070701249","title":"Seungdong Church (승동교회)","description":"Seungdong Presbyterian Church was designated Tangible Cultural Asset No. 130 by the Seoul Metropolitan Government on April 6, 2001. Originally known as “Gondanggol Church,” the church was established by Samuel Foreman Moore (1860-1906) in 1893. In those days, the church was known as a “baekjeong church” since it primarily drew Korea’s social underdogs such baekjeong (the butchers), the untouchable class of Joseon society. <br><br>Following a number of relocations and name changes (called “Gondanggol,” “Jungang,” and finally “Seungdong”) the church was moved to its current location in Insadong. After Moore died in 1906, Charles Allen Clark became the pastor of the church and Mongyang Yuh Woon-hyung, a key figure in the political history of Joseon, became active in the church. The church was attended by many other activists as well. In fact, the large student demonstration that took place during the March 1st Independence Movement in 1919 was organized by a group of young church members. The church once again made its mark on history with the establishment of the Joseon Theological Seminary in 1939. <br><br>Seungdong Church (B1-2F) covers a total of 660 square meters.

Coadjutor bishop Coste was in charge of design and construction and the building was eventually completed in 1892. The church was named after Yakjeonhyeon, or a hill of medicinal herbs. This is because the place where the church is located was once a hilly area covered with medicinal herbs.
