The tale is about a dragon that emerged from the east sea along with his seven sons at the end of the Silla Kingdom (57BC - 935AD). One of the dragon’s sons named Cheoyong came to the capital and married a beautiful woman. One night, he found an evil spirit trying to attack his wife so he sang and danced, whereupon the spirit presented itself and kneeled in apology. Since then, people have used the image of Cheoyong to dispel evil spirits. <br><br>The dance that Cheoyong is said to have performed has been titled Cheoyongmu and has been designated as an Important Intangible Cultural Property.
