The breathtaking view of the sunrise can be seen a minute earlier than Cape Homigot in Yeongilman Bay and five minutes earlier than Jeongdongjin in Gangneung. Cape Ganjeolgot is in the spotlight as a new tourist attraction along with Jinha Beach and Seosaengpo Japanese Fortress. The lighthouse is located 20 minutes away from the entrance to Ulsan Nambu Beltway. When acacias bloom along the coast from Ulsan to Haeundae Beach in Busan, the road is filled with its subtle perfume. This road is perfect as a driving course with the combination of beautiful white acacia trees in the hills and the occasional appearance of the sea. Enjoy the tremendous scenery of the invigorating sea and the misty view of the hills. Although it is only 20 minutes away from Ulsan Nambu Beltway, the scenic beauty contributes to the exotic look.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-52-239-6313|\n|parking:|Available|\n|usetime:|10:00-17:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Available Facilities:|Promotion hall, grass plaza, observatory, etc.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-16-1657953961681/2364241_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-16-1657953961681/2364241_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-16-1657953961681/2364242_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-16-1657953961681/2364242_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-16-1657953961681/2364243_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-16-1657953961681/2364243_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-16-1657953961681/2648692_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-16-1657953961681/2648692_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-16-1657953961681/2648693_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-16-1657953961681/2648693_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-16-1657953961681/2648695_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-16-1657953961681/2648695_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-16-1657953961681/2648696_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-16-1657953961681/2648696_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-52-239-6313](tel:+82522396313)\n- [üè†www.lighthouselove.com](http://www.lighthouselove.com)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.3589668021\nlongitude: 129.3605738299\ntitle: 39-2, Ganjeolgot 1-gil, Ulju-gun, Ulsan\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Ulsan Express Bus Terminal Bus Stop, take Bus No. 715 to Ganjeolgot Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-16-1657953961681","title":"Ganjeolgot Lighthouse (Í∞ÑÏ†àÍ≥∂ Îì±ÎåÄ)","description":"The sunrise along the East Coast can be viewed earliest at Cape Ganjeolgot in Daesong-ri, Uljin-gun.
