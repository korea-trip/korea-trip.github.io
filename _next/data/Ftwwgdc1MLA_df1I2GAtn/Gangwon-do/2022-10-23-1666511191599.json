When Taejo of Goryeo was surrounded by the army of Gyeon Hwon (founder of Later Baekje) at the Palgongsan Battle in Daegu, Sin exchanged armor with Taejo’s armor to disguise himself as the king and died. The enemy thought that he was Taejo and beheaded him, and Taejo made his head with gold in sorrow and held a funeral for him. The Tomb of Sin Sung-gyeom consists of three mounds, which are said to have been a measure that Taejo took lest the golden head should be stolen. The location of the tomb is regarded as one of the best propitious sites for a grave in Korea, based on geomancy. Surrounded by pine trees, this site overlooks downtown Chuncheon. The tombstone, shrine, and memorial stone were built around the tomb. This tomb was designated as Gangwon-do Monument No. 21 under the title “Sin jangjeolgong Myoyeok (Tomb of Sin Sung-gyeom),” while the memorial stone, bearing the story of the Palgongsan Battle and Sin Sung-gyeom’s performance, was designated as Gangwon-do’ Tangible Cultural Heritage No. 155.","regDate":"2022-10-27","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-27-1666849629456/182077_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-27-1666849629456"},{"id":"2022-10-27-1666847343609","title":"Sinheungsa Temple (신흥사(설악산))","description":"Sinheungsa Temple was founded under the name of Hyangseongsa Temple by Buddhist monk Jajang during the reign of Queen Jindeok of the Silla dynasty. It was first established at the site of Kensington Hotel, but after being destroyed by fire several times, it was rebuilt at the present position during the reign of King Injo of the Joseon dynasty. According to a legend, Monks Yeongseo, Hyewon, and Yeonok all had envisioned the location in their dreams in which a white-haired heavenly man appeared and indicated them the place of the temple. Thus, the temple was re-constructed at the current location and renamed as “Sinheungsa,” meaning “the temple was blessed by God (sin) and became prosper (heung). However, the Chinese character sin of the temple’s name was changed in 1995 from sin meaning god to sin meaning “new,” wishing that the temple will revive Buddhism again in the Yeongdong area (eastern part of the Taebaek Mountain Range). Sinheungsa Temple is home to many cultural heritages including the Geungnakbojeon Hall at Sinheungsa Temple (Treasure) and the Three-story Stone Pagoda at Hyangseongsa Temple Site (Treasure), which is standing on the opposite side of Kensington Star Hotel . The temple also offers the temple stay program in which participants can experience a temple life by doing activities such as communal Buddhist meal service (baru gongyang), ceremonial service involving chanting, 108 bows aimed at removing 108 earthly desires, as well as programs of making a lotus lantern and Buddhist rosary.","regDate":"2022-10-27","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-27-1666847343609/166406_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-27-1666847343609"},{"id":"2022-10-26-1666781111969","title":"Seungilgyo Bridge (승일교)","description":"Seungilgyo Bridge is unique in that it was jointly built by South and North Korea.

It was designated as Koreas fifth national park in 1970 after the designation of Hallyeohaesang National Park, and as Koreas first UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1982. It has been also registered in the IUCN Green List of Protected and Conserved Areas, which is the global standard of best practice for area-based conservation. Having Daecheongbong Peak as the mountains main peak, Seoraksan National Park, with a total area of 398 km², is divided  into the outer section (Oeseorak, eastern section), the inner section (Naeseorak, western section), and the southern section (Namseorak). Daecheongbong Peak (1,708 m) is the third highest peak in Korea after Hallasan Mountain and Jirisan Mountain, and as the peak is covered with snow for five to six months of the year, the mountain got the name Seorak (meaning a snowy peak). The summit of Daecheongbong Peak commands the magnificent natural landscape of Seoraksan Mountain and the East Sea. In particular, it is known for the fantastic views of the sunrise and sunset. In addition to Daecheongbong Peak, Seoraksan Mountain has some 30 grand peaks, such as Socheongbong, Hwachaebong, and Jungcheongbong.

It is also the origin of most of Seoraksan Mountain’s famous valleys, like Cheonbuldong and Gayadong Valleys. Because of erratic weather and low temperature, Daecheongbong Peak is often covered in snow from late October to late spring. Its ridges are populated by Siberian dwarf pine, Hairy Korean rhododendron, Ermans birch, and subalpine trees, making it a valuable source for alpine plant research. Four trails in the Seoraksan National Park take the visitors to this peak, through Osaek, Baekdam, Seorak-dong, and Osaengnyeong (Hangyeryeong) Pass. The shortest trail is the 5 km-long Osaek Trail (Osaek – Seorak Falls – Daecheongbong Peak), taking about 4 hr in total.
