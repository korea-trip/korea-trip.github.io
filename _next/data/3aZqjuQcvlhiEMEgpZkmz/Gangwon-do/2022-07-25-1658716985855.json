In addition to the legendary iron seated Variocana Buddha statue (National Treasure No. 63) made by Monk Doseon, the temple houses a 4.1 meter-tall three-story stone pagoda (Treasure No. 223).\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotliine: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-33-455-2471|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Open 24 hr|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Not available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-25-1658716985855/1135548_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658716985855/1135548_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658716985855/1135569_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658716985855/1135569_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658716985855/1135585_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658716985855/1135585_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658716985855/1135598_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658716985855/1135598_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658716985855/1135618_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658716985855/1135618_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658716985855/1135620_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658716985855/1135620_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658716985855/1135629_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658716985855/1135629_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658716985855/1135631_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658716985855/1135631_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658716985855/1135633_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658716985855/1135633_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-33-455-2471](tel:+82334552471)\n- [üè†www.cwg.go.kr](https://www.cwg.go.kr/tour/index.do)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 38.2403050273\nlongitude: 127.2182962522\ntitle: 23, Dopidong-gil, Cheorwon-gun, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-25-1658716985855","title":"Cheorwon Dopiansa Temple (ÎèÑÌîºÏïàÏÇ¨(Ï≤†Ïõê))","description":"Dopiansa Temple was built by the Buddhist Monk Doseon in 865, the 5th year of the reign of King Gyeongmun of the Unified Silla Period.
