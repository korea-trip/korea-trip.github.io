Both Daeeungjeon and Hyanggakjeon sit facing east, and to the north, is the large Yosache (residence for Buddhist monks). Behind the residence, an area has been leveled down for a restroom and storehouse. And Samseongak (a building where three saints are worshipped) is situated on top of the mound to the south of the temple. Although Samseongak was constructed in recent years, both Daeungjeon and Yosache are identified in the restored record that was found by Buddhist monk, Seobong in 1891. The temple has gained renown for being the place where Saint Mangong attained his Buddhist awakening and recited Odoseong, the zen poetry in July, 1895.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(English, Korean, Japanese, Chinese)<br>• For more info: +82-41-543-4004|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|None|\n|usetime:|From sunrise to sunset|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Not available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-28-1659014406621/1495769_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1659014406621/1495769_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1659014406621/1495771_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1659014406621/1495771_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1659014406621/1495772_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1659014406621/1495772_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1659014406621/1495774_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1659014406621/1495774_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1659014406621/1495775_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1659014406621/1495775_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1659014406621/1495776_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1659014406621/1495776_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1659014406621/1495777_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1659014406621/1495777_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1659014406621/1495779_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1659014406621/1495779_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1659014406621/1495783_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1659014406621/1495783_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1659014406621/1495785_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1659014406621/1495785_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-41-543-4004](tel:+82415434004)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.6988627031\nlongitude: 126.9665905861\ntitle: 138, Dosong-ro 632beon-gil, Asan-si, Chungcheongnam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>\nFrom Seoul Express Bus Terminal, take a bus to Asan Bus Terminal.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-28-1659014406621","title":"Bonggoksa Temple (봉곡사)","description":"Surrounded by lush wildlife Bonggoksa Temple is located alongside the northeast valley in Bongsusan Mountain in Namdan, Songak-myeon.
