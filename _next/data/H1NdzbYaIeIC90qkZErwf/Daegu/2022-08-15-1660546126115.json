This was his house from 1939 until his death in 1943. His house was neglected after he died, until a citizens' movement in 1999 to preserve the house urged the Military Mutual Aid Association to purchase it, and donate it to the City of Daegu on October 27, 2005. It has been restored and opened to the public, serving as the center for education of the poet's brave spirit and work.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-53-256-3762|\n|parking:|Not available|\n|restdate:|Mondays, Seollal (Lunar New Year's Day) & Chuseok (Korean Thanksgiving Day) holidays|\n|usetime:|Summer 10:00-18:00<br>Winter 10:00-17:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-15-1660546126115/1575218_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-15-1660546126115/1575218_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-15-1660546126115/1575219_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-15-1660546126115/1575219_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-15-1660546126115/1575220_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-15-1660546126115/1575220_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-15-1660546126115/1575221_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-15-1660546126115/1575221_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-15-1660546126115/1644421_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-15-1660546126115/1644421_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-15-1660546126115/1644422_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-15-1660546126115/1644422_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-15-1660546126115/1644431_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-15-1660546126115/1644431_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-15-1660546126115/2050637_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-15-1660546126115/2050637_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-53-256-3762](tel:+82532563762)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.8672757115\nlongitude: 128.5880022947\ntitle: 6-1, Seoseong-ro, Jung-gu, Daegu\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway]<br>\nBanwoldang Station (Daegu Subway Line 1 or 2), Exit 18.<br> Go straight 170 m and turn right onto Yangnyeong-gil.\n<BR>Walk straight for approx. 100 m and turn left at the first corner.\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-15-1660546126115","title":"House of Yi Sang-hwa (이상화 고택)","description":"Yi Sang-hwa was a nationalist poet, who resisted the Japanese colonialism.
