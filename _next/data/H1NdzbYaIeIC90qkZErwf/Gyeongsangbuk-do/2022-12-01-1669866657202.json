Since its construction centuries ago, the house has been inhabitated by the descendants of Sin Deuk-cheong, the 15th eldest grandson of General Sin Sung-gyem. This house has all of the features of an upper–class house of the Joseon period. The buildings of the house are built in a rectangular shape, with the courtyard in the center. The compound consists of Soteuldaemun (high-rising gate), Haengrangchae (servants’ quarters located next to the gate), Gotgan (storeroom in which grain and other items were stored), Anchae (room for the female family members) and a pavilion.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-54-870-6247|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-01-1669866657202/187513_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-01-1669866657202/187513_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-01-1669866657202/187514_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-01-1669866657202/187514_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-01-1669866657202/2533764_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-01-1669866657202/2533764_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-01-1669866657202/2533765_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-01-1669866657202/2533765_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-01-1669866657202/2533766_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-01-1669866657202/2533766_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-01-1669866657202/2533767_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-01-1669866657202/2533767_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-01-1669866657202/2533769_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-01-1669866657202/2533769_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-01-1669866657202/2533770_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-01-1669866657202/2533770_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-01-1669866657202/2533771_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-01-1669866657202/2533771_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-01-1669866657202/2533768_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-01-1669866657202/2533768_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-54-870-6247](tel:+82548706247)\n- [🏠www.cs.go.kr</a><br><a title=\"New window popup\" class=\"web\" href=\"http://www.cha.go.kr\">www.cha.go.kr](www.cs.go.kr/tour.web)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.4585389541\nlongitude: 129.0228304029\ntitle: 16, Jungdeul 2-gil, Cheongsong-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-01-1669866657202","title":"Head House of Pansagongpa Branch of Pyeongsan Sin Clan (청송 평산신씨 판사공파 종택과 분가 고택)","description":"Located in Cheongsong-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do Province, Head House of Pansagongpa Branch of Pyeongsan Sin Clan is the head house of the noble Pyeongsan Sin family line.

The name of the mountain on which the temple was built was originally called Gongdeoksan, but was later known as Sabulsan. The name, Sabulsan, (meaning “Four Buddhas”) comes from the legend of the Silla Period in which a large stone shrouded with red silk and etched with four faces of Buddha mysteriously descended upon the mountain. Upon hearing the news of this miraculous event, the king at the time (King Jinpyeong) immediately visited the spot and had the temple built next to the sacred stone.<br><br>The temple was partially destroyed by fire in the summer of 1922, but was restored in 1927 thanks to the efforts of Monks Uiun, Chwiwol, and Deoksan. In January 1958, the temple once again suffered fire damage, leaving only a few buildings (Geukrakjeon, Myeongbujeon, and Sansingak) untouched. Monks Daehyu, Seolwol, and Jeongam helped to restore the temple and the temple has remained well-preserved ever since.","regDate":"2022-12-03","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-03-1670045778020/1967495_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-03-1670045778020"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
