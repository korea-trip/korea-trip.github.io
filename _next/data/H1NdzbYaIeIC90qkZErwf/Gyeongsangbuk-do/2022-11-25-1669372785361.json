Rock art from the time period was created on rocks or other planes considered to be sacred and usually carried a message of fertility. The artwork of Yangjeondong shows layered circles (symbolizing the sun and the moon), crosses (depicting the “life zone” of the tribe), and 17 masks. The artwork is considered to have been used for ceremonial purposes or farming events.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-54-955-2201|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-25-1669372785361/1004045_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-25-1669372785361/1004045_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-25-1669372785361/2493151_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-25-1669372785361/2493151_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-25-1669372785361/2493154_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-25-1669372785361/2493154_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-25-1669372785361/2493155_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-25-1669372785361/2493155_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-25-1669372785361/2493156_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-25-1669372785361/2493156_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-25-1669372785361/2493157_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-25-1669372785361/2493157_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-25-1669372785361/2493158_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-25-1669372785361/2493158_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-25-1669372785361/2493263_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-25-1669372785361/2493263_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.7128155575\nlongitude: 128.2921603954\ntitle: 15-5, Araealteo-gil, Goryeong-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus + Taxi]<BR>\nFrom Goryeong Bus Terminal, take a taxi to Yangjeondong Rock Art. <br><br>OR, <br>Take a local bus bound for Gaejin and get off at Hayangjeon Bus Stop.<br>Walk for approx. 600m\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-25-1669372785361","title":"Goryeong Janggi-ri Rock Art (고령 장기리 암각화)","description":"Yangjeondong Rock Art (discovered in 1971) is a rock painting 3 meters high and 5.5 meters wide that vividly depicts the life and religion of the Prehistoric Age.

The name of the mountain on which the temple was built was originally called Gongdeoksan, but was later known as Sabulsan. The name, Sabulsan, (meaning “Four Buddhas”) comes from the legend of the Silla Period in which a large stone shrouded with red silk and etched with four faces of Buddha mysteriously descended upon the mountain. Upon hearing the news of this miraculous event, the king at the time (King Jinpyeong) immediately visited the spot and had the temple built next to the sacred stone.<br><br>The temple was partially destroyed by fire in the summer of 1922, but was restored in 1927 thanks to the efforts of Monks Uiun, Chwiwol, and Deoksan. In January 1958, the temple once again suffered fire damage, leaving only a few buildings (Geukrakjeon, Myeongbujeon, and Sansingak) untouched. Monks Daehyu, Seolwol, and Jeongam helped to restore the temple and the temple has remained well-preserved ever since.","regDate":"2022-12-03","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-03-1670045778020/1967495_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-03-1670045778020"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
