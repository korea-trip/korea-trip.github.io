Those who were displaced by the war gathered around the area and made makeshift housing out of sticks and tarps. The place also functioned as a marketplace where residents traded aid goods that were delivered at the nearby port. It was a place to meet family members separated during the war and a place that has since then come to symbolize the sorrow and grief of those living during the Korean War. The place has the deepest significance for the over 100,000 people that were displaced during the war and were subsequently scattered throughout Yeongju-dong Hill, Donggwang-dong and Bosu-dong.<br> <br><b>* Railway </b><br>In memory of the Busan Train Station (now the location of the Jungang-dong Trade Center), a 140m-street was created in front of the 40-step Stairway, together with the 40-step Square and Railroad Crossing Plaza.<br><br><b>* Seaway</b> <br>In commemoration of the Busan Port, under the theme of a 'seaway,' a 120m-street has been created in front of Sora Stairway, together with the Sora Stair Square and Pier Plaza. <br><br><b>* Others (The Gate of Peace)<br></b>The Gate of Peace is located near the entrance of Railway.
