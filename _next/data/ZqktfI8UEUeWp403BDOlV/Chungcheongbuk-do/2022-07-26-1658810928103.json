During the early years of Catholicism in Korea, Catholics fleeing from the Sinhae Persecution (1791) came to this place, formed a community, and made their faith deeper. Amid the persecution in 1801, A man named Hwang Sa-yeong (Alexander, 1775–1801) hid in a tunnel and wrote letters about the situation of the Joseon Catholic Church on silk fabrics, but was captured and martyred. Baeron is also a historic place where Joseon’s first theological school, St. Joseph Theological School, was founded, but the school was eventually shut down. The graves of Fr. Thomas Choe Yang-eop (1821–1861), Korea’s second Roman Catholic priest, and the Martyr Hwang Sa-yeong Memorial Tower can be seen at Baeron Holy Ground.<br>\n <br>\n Baeron Holy Ground is surrounded by rugged mountains such as Guhaksan Mountain, Baegunsan Mountain and Chiaksan Mountain. The mountain path from the holy ground eventually leads to Bakdaljae Natural Forest.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|accomcount:|Large cathedral 2,000 people / Small cathedral 300 people|\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-43-651-4527|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Churches, Catholic school, sculpture park, etc.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-26-1658810928103/1596814_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-26-1658810928103/1596814_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-26-1658810928103/1596815_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-26-1658810928103/1596815_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-26-1658810928103/1596816_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-26-1658810928103/1596816_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-26-1658810928103/1596817_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-26-1658810928103/1596817_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-26-1658810928103/1596818_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-26-1658810928103/1596818_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-26-1658810928103/1596819_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-26-1658810928103/1596819_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-26-1658810928103/1596820_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-26-1658810928103/1596820_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-26-1658810928103/1596821_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-26-1658810928103/1596821_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-26-1658810928103/1596822_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-26-1658810928103/1596822_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-26-1658810928103/1596823_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-26-1658810928103/1596823_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-43-651-4527](tel:+82436514527)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.1612158025\nlongitude: 128.0837937022\ntitle: 296, Baeronseongji-gil, Jecheon-si, Chungcheongbuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>\nFrom Dong Seoul Bus Terminal or Seoul Express Bus Terminal, take an intercity bus to Jecheon Intercity Bus Terminal or Jecheon Express Bus Terminal.<br>\nWalk for 167 m toward Jungang Crossing and take Bus No. 852 at Tongyang Securities Inc.
