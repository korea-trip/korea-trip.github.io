The beach is also popular among tourists at sunset, when the fading sun colors the sea around the rock.<br> On the other side is a small dock and old fishing boats. This beach is less crowded than Wangsan Beach or those in Eurwang-ri, making it the perfect spot for swimming and camping. <br> There is a pretty cafe up the hill from the rock and it is a great place for enjoying the ocean scenery with a cup of tea.
