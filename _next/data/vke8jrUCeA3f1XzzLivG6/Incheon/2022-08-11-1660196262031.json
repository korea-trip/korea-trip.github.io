The fortress was built in 1656 and the outpost was constructed in 1679. It was completely remodeled into \na masonry castle with gates in 1745. During Sinmiyangyo (the American invasion in 1871), Gwangseongbo was the fiercest battle ground in Ganghwa. On April 24, 1871, a \n fleet with 1,230 American naval forces led by Rear Admiral John Rodgers landed on Ganghwado Island to demand the \nopening of Korea's ports and commerce. The armed forces attacked Chojijin Fortress \nand Deokjinjin Camp, then marched to Gwangseongbo Fortress, where they engaged in close combat with the warriors of Joseon. Although General Eo Jae-yeon and the other warriors were poorly equipped with far inferior weapons, they bravely fought to the \ndeath against the invading forces. \n\n<br><br>The battlefield ruins of the fortress and the gate towers such as Anhaeru, Gwangseongdon, Sondolmokdon, and Yongdudon were repaired \nin 1977.  The twin tombs of General Eo Jae-Yeon and his brother Eo Jae-seon, along with the anonymous tombs of warriors who died on the battlefield were \nalso honorably arranged at the same time. Furthermore, a stone monument commemorating the restoration of Ganghwa Battlefield was erected on Yongdudondae Post. \n<br><br>In 1988, an extensive rest area was created toward the shore for visitors‚Äô convenience.

The film set, however, was demolished after the shooting. The pathway to the island, which has no residents, can be shown during low tide.

The beach is also popular among tourists at sunset, when the fading sun colors the sea around the rock.<br> On the other side is a small dock and old fishing boats. This beach is less crowded than Wangsan Beach or those in Eurwang-ri, making it the perfect spot for swimming and camping. <br> There is a pretty cafe up the hill from the rock and it is a great place for enjoying the ocean scenery with a cup of tea. On the other side of the cafe is a garden with pine trees, yet another beautiful spot to watch the sunset.","regDate":"2022-08-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Nature","Natural Resources","Rocks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-12-1660277185177/1826990_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-08-12-1660277185177"},{"id":"2022-08-12-1660271887021","title":"Seongmodo Island (ÏÑùÎ™®ÎèÑ)","description":"Seongmodo Island, located 1.2 kilometers west of Ganghwado Island, is a popular destination for families and those looking for relaxation.
