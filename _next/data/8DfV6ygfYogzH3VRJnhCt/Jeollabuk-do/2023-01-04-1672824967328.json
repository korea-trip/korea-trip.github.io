There are 735 traditional Korean hanok houses. While the rest of the city has been industrialized, Hanok Village retains its historical charms and traditions. <br /><br />The charm of Jeonju Hanok Village lies in the hanok buildings unique roof edges, which are slightly raised to the sky. Hanok houses are generally divided into two sections, <em>anchae</em> and <em>sarangchae</em>. Sarangchae is where the men dwell. Because men and women had to remain separated, anchae is situated deep inside the house so that it is secretive and quiet. <br /><br />Another trait of hanok is that all the houses are heated with ondol, a unique floor heating system. Since Koreans enjoy sitting, eating, and sleeping on the floor, it needs to remain heated in winter. To experience what hanok is like, visitors can either book a hanok accommodation or visit the Hanok Life Experience Hall.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-63-282-1330|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Available Facilities:|[Cultural facilities]<br>Jeonju Craft Exhibition, Jeonju Sori Arts Center, Jeonju Fan Museum, etc.<br><br>[Cultural heritages]<br>Gyeonggijeon Shrine, Portrait of King Taejo, Jeondong Cathedral, Jeonjuhyanggo Local Confucian School, etc.<br><br>[Unique attractions]<br>Jaman Mural Village, Nambu Night Market, Jeonju Nanjang, etc.|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-04-1672824967328/2674220_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-04-1672824967328/2674220_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-04-1672824967328/2674221_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-04-1672824967328/2674221_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-04-1672824967328/2674222_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-04-1672824967328/2674222_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-04-1672824967328/2674223_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-04-1672824967328/2674223_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-63-282-1330](tel:+82632821330)\n- [🏠hanok.jeonju.go.kr](http://hanok.jeonju.go.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.8183333748\nlongitude: 127.1536778411\ntitle: 99, Girin-daero, Wansan-gu, Jeonju-si, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-04-1672824967328","title":"Jeonju Hanok Village [Slow City] (전북 전주 한옥마을 [슬로시티])","description":"Jeonju Hanok Village is located in the city of Jeonju and overlaps Pungnam-dong and Gyo-dong.
