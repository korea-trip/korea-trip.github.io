For many years the temple lay incomplete until Monk Bojo Chejing began reconstruction in the 7th year of King Gyeongmun of Silla (AD 867). The temple was destroyed at one point in time, but Master Monk Jinul prayed that it be rebuilt. In accordance with his fervent hopes, in the 1600s the monk’s followers rebuilt a number of the temple’s halls and buildings, many of which can still be seen today. The temple is also remembered as the temple that King Injo helped rebuild with the hope that his two sons, who had been taken hostage by the Qing dynasty during the Byeongjahoran War (Chinese invasion of Korea in 1636), would be returned safely and that Buddha would heal the nation.<br><br> One of the Korea’s four major temples, Songgwangsa is home to Jijangbosal and Siwangsang statues (found in Jijangjeon Hall), a Seokgayeorae statue, and 500 Nahansang statues (found in Nahanjeon Hall). The temple is also home to eight Tangible Cultural Assets and four Treasured Cultural Assets  Daeungjeon Hall, the Samsebulsang statues, the bell-tower, and the Sacheonwangsang statue.<br><br>Beloved for its historical significance as well as its beauty, the temple draws throngs of worshipers throughout the year. In spring, many tourists flock to the area to explore the temple and walk through the nearby cherry blossom tunnels. A worthwhile attraction for visitors of all ages, the temple is particularly well-suited for those with mobility problems since it is located on ground level.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-63-243-8091|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year around)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-10-1673343382073/215129_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-10-1673343382073/215129_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-10-1673343382073/215442_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-10-1673343382073/215442_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-10-1673343382073/215445_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-10-1673343382073/215445_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-10-1673343382073/1605106_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-10-1673343382073/1605106_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-10-1673343382073/1605107_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-10-1673343382073/1605107_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-10-1673343382073/1605108_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-10-1673343382073/1605108_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-10-1673343382073/1605109_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-10-1673343382073/1605109_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-10-1673343382073/1605110_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-10-1673343382073/1605110_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-10-1673343382073/1605115_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-10-1673343382073/1605115_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-10-1673343382073/215443_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-10-1673343382073/215443_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-63-243-8091](tel:+82632438091)\n- [🏠songgwangsa.or.kr</a><br><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3gkth6Y\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"새창 : 완주문화관광 사이트로 이동\">www.wanju.go.kr]( http://songgwangsa.or.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.8842746273\nlongitude: 127.2417793808\ntitle: 255-16, Songgwangsuman-ro, Wanju-gun, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>\nFrom Jeonju Bus Terminal, take Bus No. 806, 814 or 838 and get off at Songgwangsa Temple Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-10-1673343382073","title":"Wanju Songgwangsa Temple (송광사(완주))","description":"Songgwangsa Temple in Wanju-gun, Jeollabuk-do has a unique history that spans a period of over a thousand years.

The present temple is largely the result of reconstruction efforts completed in the 1970s. One of the most prized treasures at the temple is the Ijo-dongjong Bell, considered a major cultural asset. <br><br>Naejangsan Temple is a representative temple of Jeollabuk-do along with Geumsansa Temple on Moaksan Mountain.
