The Daeungbojeon Hall was built at this time. In 1986, the temple area was designated as a culturally protected area.  \n<br><br>\nOn both sides of the main gate are large fir trees, which also line the path into the temple. Upon reaching the temple itself, the first thing that draws attention is the 1000-year-old Dangsan tree. Long ago, people used the base of the tree as a site of prayer.  \n<br><br>\nHoused in Beomjonggak is a bronze bell that can be found in many Buddhist temples. This particular bell was made during the Goryeo era and is engraved with three images of Buddha, called Samjonsang. The center building of the temple, called Daeungbojeon Hall is also an artistic masterpiece, decorated with splendid colors and designs. The flower Salmun doors featuring lotus and chrysanthemum flowers add another element of traditional beauty to the building.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|expagerange:|Open to visitors ages 5 & over|\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82- 63-583-7281|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Sunrise-sunset|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Hiking Course:|* Naesosa Temple - Gwaneumbong Junction - Jaebaekigogae Pass - Wonam Hermitage (3.6 km / 2 hr)<br />* Naesosa Temple - Gwaneumbong Junction - Jaebaekigogae Pass - Jiksopokpo Falls - Saja-dong (6.2 km / 3 hr)<br />* Naesosa Temple - Gwaneumbong Junction - Jaebaekigogae Pass - Jiksopokpo Falls - Nature Preservation Pagoda - Wolmyeongam Hermitage - Namyeochi (8.9 km / 4 hr 30 min)|\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals ‚Äì Adults 4,000 won / Teenagers 3,000 won / Children 1,000 won<br>Groups ‚Äì Adults 3,500 won / Teenagers 2,500 won / Children 800 won<br><br>* Groups: 30 people or more|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|[For the first 1 hour]<br>Compact cars: 500 won<br>Regular & Mid-sized cars: 1,100 won<br>Large-sized cars: 2,000 won<br><br>[Each additional 10 minutes after 1 hr]<br>Compact cars: 100 won<br>Regular & Mid-sized cars: 250 won (300 won during peak season)<br>Large-sized cars: 400 won (500 won during peak season)<br><br>[More than 9 hr]<br>Compact cars: 5,000 won<br>Regular vehicles: 10,000 won<br>Mid-sized cars: 15,000 won<br>Large-sized cars: 20,000 won|\n|Available Facilities:|Walking paths, hiking trails, etc.|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Inquries: +82-63-580-4388|\n|Reservation Info. for Foreigners:|Phone reservation available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-31-1659253012378/1604323_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659253012378/1604323_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659253012378/1604324_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659253012378/1604324_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659253012378/1983022_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659253012378/1983022_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659253012378/1983024_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659253012378/1983024_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659253012378/1983025_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659253012378/1983025_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659253012378/2678634_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659253012378/2678634_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659253012378/2678635_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659253012378/2678635_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659253012378/2678637_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659253012378/2678637_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659253012378/2678638_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659253012378/2678638_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659253012378/2678639_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659253012378/2678639_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82- 63-583-7281](tel:+82 635837281)\n- [üè†www.templestay.com](https://www.templestay.com/temple_info.asp?t_id=naesosa )\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.6178048314\nlongitude: 126.5876028523\ntitle: 243, Naesosa-ro, Buan-gun, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-31-1659253012378","title":"Buan Naesosa Temple (ÎÇ¥ÏÜåÏÇ¨ (Î∂ÄÏïà))","description":"Naesosa Temple was built by Buddhist Monk Hye-Gu in 633 during the Baekje dynasty and was rebuilt by Monk Cheong-Min in 1633 during the Joseon dynasty.
