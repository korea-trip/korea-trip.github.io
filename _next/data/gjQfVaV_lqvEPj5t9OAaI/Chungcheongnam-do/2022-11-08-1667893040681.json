Through restoration and purification projects, its old image has been restored as a historic park and it is famous as a site of Catholic martyrs in the late Joseon era. <br><br>During the persecution of Catholics, many Catholics from Chungcheong-do were forced to come to Haemieupseong Walled Town where the administration office was located. Upon arrival, they were tortured to death. In particular, approximately 1,000 people are recorded as having been executed during the persecution in 1866. <br><br>The plaza inside of the fortress has a prison site where Catholics were chained up under the Daewongun government, and a gigantic old tree which was the tree used for torturing.
