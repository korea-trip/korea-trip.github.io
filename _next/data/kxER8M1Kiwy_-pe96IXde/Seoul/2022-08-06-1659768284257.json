{"pageProps":{"content":"![Myeong-dong (명동)](/2022-08-06-1659768284257/1987703_image2_1.webp)\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> Myeong-dong is one of the primary shopping districts in Seoul. The two main streets meet in the center of the block with one beginning from Myeong-dong Subway Station (Seoul Subway Line No. 4) and the other from Lotte Department Store at Euljiro. Many brand name shops and department stores line the streets and alleys. Common products for sale include clothes, shoes, and accessories. Unlike Namdaemun or Dongdaemun, many designer brands are sold in Myeong-dong. In addition, several major department stores have branches here, including Lotte Department Store, Shinsegae Department Store, Myeong-dong Migliore, Noon Square and M Plaza. The department stores carry many premium labels and other fashionable goods at reasonable prices. <br><br>\n\nMyeong-dong also has family restaurants, fast food, plus Korean, Western and Japanese dining options. Many restaurants in Myeong-dong specialize in <em>dongaseu</em> (pork cutlet) and <em>kalguksu</em> (noodle soup). Other businesses in the area include hair salons, banks and theaters.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>• For more info: +82-2-778-0333|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)<br>* Operating schedules will vary by shop.|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|1330 Korea Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>Myeong-dong Tourist Infromation Center: +82-2-778-0333|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-06-1659768284257/399376_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-06-1659768284257/399376_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-06-1659768284257/758330_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-06-1659768284257/758330_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-06-1659768284257/774019_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-06-1659768284257/774019_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-06-1659768284257/774021_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-06-1659768284257/774021_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-06-1659768284257/2002309_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-06-1659768284257/2002309_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-06-1659768284257/2034065_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-06-1659768284257/2034065_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-06-1659768284257/2034066_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-06-1659768284257/2034066_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-06-1659768284257/2034067_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-06-1659768284257/2034067_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-06-1659768284257/2034068_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-06-1659768284257/2034068_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-06-1659768284257/2002325_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-06-1659768284257/2002325_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-2-778-0333](tel:+8227780333)\n- [🏠tour.junggu.seoul.kr](http://www.junggu.seoul.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5651434137\nlongitude: 126.9850038013\ntitle: 66, Eulji-ro, Jung-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway]<br>\nEuljiro 1(il)-ga Station (Seoul Subway Line 2), Exits 5, 6 & 7.<br>\nMyeong-dong Station (Seoul Subway Line 4), Exits 5, 6, 7 & 8.<br><br>\n\n[Bus]<br>\nEuljiro1(il)-ga Station and Lotte Department Bus Stop<br>\n- Green Bus No. 7017, 7021, 7022<br>\n- Blue Bus No. 100, 143, 151, 152, 202, 261, 405, 701, 702A, 702B<br>\n- Express Bus No. 1005-1, 1150, 5000, 5005, 7900, 8800, 9000, 9001, 9003, 9007<br>\n- Red Bus No. 2500, 9401, 9701, M4101, M4102, M4108, 5115<br>\n- Airport Bus No. 6001, 6015<br>\n<br>\nMyeong-dong Station Bus Stop<br>\n- Green Bus: No. 7011<br>\n- Blue Bus: No. 104, 105, 421, 463, 507, 604<br>\n- Express Bus: No. 1005-1, 1150, 5000, 5005, 5007, 5500, 5500-1, 5500-2, 8800, 9000, 9001, 9003, 9007<br>\n- Red Bus: No. M4101, M4102, M4108<br>\n- Airport Bus: No. 6001, 6015\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-06-1659768284257","title":"Myeong-dong (명동)","description":"Myeong-dong is one of the primary shopping districts in Seoul.
