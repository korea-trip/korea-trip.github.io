However, despite their wide appearance, a lack of historical documents has hampered the true understanding of the statues. Bukchon Dol Hareubang Park puts together a wide variety of the statutes and, in doing so, illuminates their aesthetic and scholarly importance to visitors as well as future generations. In this sense, the park is not only a tourist attraction, but also a learning center for children and adults alike. The park consists of 48 Dol Hareubang, a promenade, reinterpreted Dol Hareubang focusing on the theme of peace, a traditional local garden with walking paths, and a learning center.<br><br>\n\n Dol Hareubang were previously called by various names, including Useokmok, Museokmok, or Byeoksumeori. Dol Hareubang became the official name in 1971 after being designated as a local folk heritage. Although Dol Hareubang were originally seen only around the entrance of government seats, there are over 48 officially recognized Dol Hareubang throughout the island (21 in Jeju City, 2 in National Folk Museum of Korea, 12 in Seongeup, and 13 in Daejeong), along with many replicas. The shamanistic statues are believed to offer protection and ward off demons. According to Tamnaji (Record of Tamna), Dol Hareubang are believed to have been initiated by Kim Mong-gyu, then Magistrate of Jeju in 1754 (30th year of King Yeongjo’s reign).\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-64-782-0570|\n|parking:|Available|\n|usetime:|April-October 09:00-18:00<br>November-March 09:00-17:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Adults 6,000 won / Teenagers 4,000 won |\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620008_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620008_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620009_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620009_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620010_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620010_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620011_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620011_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620012_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620012_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620013_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620013_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620014_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620014_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620015_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620015_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-64-782-0570](tel:+82647820570)\n- [🏠www.visitjeju.net](https://www.visitjeju.net/kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.5396035971\nlongitude: 126.6896605755\ntitle: 70, Bukchonseo 1-gil, Jeju-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>\nFrom Jeju Bus Terminal take a local bus bound for Seongsan and get off at Bukchon Elementary School Bus Stop. <Br> Walk for approx. 700 m towards Hallasan Mountain.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-19-1658216050635","title":"Bukchon Dol Hareubang Park (북촌 돌하르방공원)","description":"As a main symbol of Jeju Island, Dol Hareubang, literally meaning \"Old Grandfather\" stone statues, can be found everywhere on the island.
