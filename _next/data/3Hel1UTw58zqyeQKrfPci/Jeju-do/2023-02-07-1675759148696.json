The forest is equipped with amenities such as a mountain cottage, forest bathing site, campfire site, cooking area, and auto-camping site. Although the amenities serve to provide visitors’ convenience, they are minimized so as to prevent damage to the forest’s natural environment.","regDate":"2023-02-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Recreational Forests"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-12-1676176737273/1207811_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-12-1676176737273"},{"id":"2023-02-12-1676173046682","title":"Seogwipo New Paradise Cruise (서귀포유람선 뉴파라다이스호)","description":"Seogwipo New Paradise Cruise offers dazzling scenery on the coastal lines and islands around Seogwipo Port in Jeju.
