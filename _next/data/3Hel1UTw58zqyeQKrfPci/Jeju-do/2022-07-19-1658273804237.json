Geomunoreum has an altitude of 456 meters and with lava tubes spreading out in a streamlined shape, its lava tube system is the largest of its kind on Jeju Island. The name is said to have originated when the local islanders called the cone \"Geomun,\" which is translated to “black,” referring to the dense forest formed on the crater. However, according to researchers and linguists, the term \"Geomun\" may have originated from a word from the Gojoseon period which were used to refer to deities, inferring that the name Geomunoreum actually means \"holy hill.\"\n<br><br>\nGeomunoreum Lava Tube System consists of roughly 20 lava tubes that follow the cone's slope to the northeast, stretching out all the way to the shore. Among these tubes, Bwengdwigul, Mangjanggul, Gimnyeonggul, Yongcheondonggul, and Dangcheondonggul Caves are inscribed as a UNESCO World Natural Heritage.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|accomcount:|450 people|\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-64-710-8981|\n|parking:|Available (100 spaces)|\n|restdate:|Tuesdays, the day of Seollal (Lunar New Year's Day) and Chuseok (Korean Thanksgiving Day)<br> * Entrance prohibited in the case of inclement weather|\n|usetime:|09:00-13:00 (based on departure time)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Tour Course Information:|* Tour Course<br>1) Summit Course: Approx. 1.8 km / 1 hr<br>2) Crater Course: Approx.  5.5 km / 2 hr 30 min<br>3) Taeguek-gil Course: Approx.  10 km / 3 hr 30 min|\n|Admission Fees:|[Geomunoreum Admission]<br>Individuals - Adults 2,000 won / Teenagers & Children 1,000 won<br />Groups - Adults 1,600 won / Teenagers & Children 800 won<br><br />[Heritage Center]<br />Individiuals - Adults 3,000 won / Teenagers & Children 2,000 won<br />Groups - Adults 2,400 won / Teenagers & Children 1,600 won<br /><br>* Senior citizens (ages 65 & over) & preschoolers (ages 6 & under): Free|\n|Available Facilities:|Jeju World Natural Heritage Center, convenience store|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Reservation Info. for Natives:|[wnhcenter.jeju.go.kr]()|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-19-1658273804237/2661661_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658273804237/2661661_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658273804237/2661663_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658273804237/2661663_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658273804237/656725_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658273804237/656725_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658273804237/656742_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658273804237/656742_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658273804237/656745_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658273804237/656745_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658273804237/656746_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658273804237/656746_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658273804237/656756_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658273804237/656756_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658273804237/656762_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658273804237/656762_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658273804237/656769_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658273804237/656769_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658273804237/656773_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658273804237/656773_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-64-710-8981](tel:+82647108981)\n- [🏠wnhcenter.jeju.go.kr</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.visitjeju.net\" target=\"_blank\">www.visitjeju.net](http://wnhcenter.jeju.go.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.4569159249\nlongitude: 126.7147325126\ntitle: 569-36, Seongyo-ro, Jeju-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Jeju International Airport, take a bus toward Pyoseon and get off at Seonheul 2-ri (Geomunoreum) Bus Stop.\n<br>\nWalk for approx. 700 m.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-19-1658273804237","title":"Geomunoreum Lava Tube [UNESCO World Natural Heritage Site] (거문오름 [유네스코 세계자연유산])","description":"Geomunoreum  Lava Tube System is a series of lava tubes that originated from the eruption of Geomunoreum, a parasatic cone.

It takes about 30 minutes by car from Seogwipo’s downtown to the recreational park. The park is densely packed with trees and the air is filled with the refreshing forest scent, and even has a pebble walking trail suitable for a barefoot massage. The forest is equipped with amenities such as a mountain cottage, forest bathing site, campfire site, cooking area, and auto-camping site. Although the amenities serve to provide visitors’ convenience, they are minimized so as to prevent damage to the forest’s natural environment.","regDate":"2023-02-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Recreational Forests"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-12-1676176737273/1207811_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-12-1676176737273"},{"id":"2023-02-12-1676173046682","title":"Seogwipo New Paradise Cruise (서귀포유람선 뉴파라다이스호)","description":"Seogwipo New Paradise Cruise offers dazzling scenery on the coastal lines and islands around Seogwipo Port in Jeju.
