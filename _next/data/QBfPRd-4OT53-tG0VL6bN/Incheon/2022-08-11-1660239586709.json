During the Silla Kingdom (about 1,300 years ago), the temple was named ‚ÄòBaegunsa‚Äô by King Munmu, in reference to the temple‚Äôs mountain home. During the Joseon dynasty, it was the temporary residence of Heungseon Daewongun (1820-1898, a politician and father of King Gojong), who stayed at the temple for 10 years praying for his son to ascend to the throne. When his son was finally crowned king, Heungseon Daewongun rebuilt the temple and changed the name to Yonggungsa.\n<br><br>\nThe temple consists of various buildings such as Gwaneumjeon (re-constructed by Heungseon Daewongun), Yosachae (home of the monks), Chilseonggak, and Yonghwanggak. In Yosachae, the writings of Heungseon Daewongun are hung on the wall and recently, an 11 meter-high statue of Maitreya was put in place. In front of the temple are two 1,300 year-old zelkova trees.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-32-746-1361|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Open 24 hr|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-11-1660239586709/1577735_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660239586709/1577735_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660239586709/1577736_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660239586709/1577736_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660239586709/1577737_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660239586709/1577737_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660239586709/1577740_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660239586709/1577740_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660239586709/1577741_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660239586709/1577741_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-32-746-1361](tel:+82327461361)\n- [üè†itour.incheon.go.kr](http://itour.incheon.go.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.4971570919\nlongitude: 126.5279807341\ntitle: 199-1, Unnam-ro, Jung-gu, Incheon\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-11-1660239586709","title":"Incheon Yonggungsa Temple (Ïö©Í∂ÅÏÇ¨ (Ïù∏Ï≤ú))","description":"Yonggungsa Temple is located in the same region as the Incheon International Airport and sits on the northeastern slopes of Baegunsan Mountain.

The film set, however, was demolished after the shooting. The pathway to the island, which has no residents, can be shown during low tide.

Artists come to recreate the scenery of the sharp rock against the ocean on their canvas as they listen to the waves crash. The beach is also popular among tourists at sunset, when the fading sun colors the sea around the rock.<br> On the other side is a small dock and old fishing boats. This beach is less crowded than Wangsan Beach or those in Eurwang-ri, making it the perfect spot for swimming and camping. <br> There is a pretty cafe up the hill from the rock and it is a great place for enjoying the ocean scenery with a cup of tea. On the other side of the cafe is a garden with pine trees, yet another beautiful spot to watch the sunset.","regDate":"2022-08-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Nature","Natural Resources","Rocks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-12-1660277185177/1826990_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-08-12-1660277185177"},{"id":"2022-08-12-1660271887021","title":"Seongmodo Island (ÏÑùÎ™®ÎèÑ)","description":"Seongmodo Island, located 1.2 kilometers west of Ganghwado Island, is a popular destination for families and those looking for relaxation.
