{"pageProps":{"content":"![Girimsa Temple (Í∏∞Î¶ºÏÇ¨)](/2022-11-25-1669361755171/179593_image2_1.webp)\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> Girimsa Temple is located in Hamwolsan Mountain in Yangbuk-myeon, Gyeongju. The temple was built in the Silla Era and, with 16 buildings, is the second largest temple after Bulguksa. <br><br>Legend has it that the temple was originally built by the Venerable Gwang-yu, a sage from India, in the early part of the Silla Kingdom. The temple was reportedly called Imjeongsa at first, but was later changed to Girimsa after undergoing expansive renovations by Monk Wonhyo. It is still unclear exactly what year the temple was built in.   <br><br>Girimsa is divided into two main areas. The first is the area around Daejeokgwangjeon Hall where the statue of Birojanabul is enshrined. The second is the area around the majestic 500-year-old bo tree (a kind of large fig tree) that is home to a wooden pagoda, the Seongbo Museum, Samsingak, Mangbujeon, and Gwaneumjeon halls. Daejeokgwangjeon Hall was first built during Queen Seondeoks reign, and was rebuilt six times since its original construction. Its simple but majestic architecture is characterized by baeheullim (aka, entasis columns) and a Dapoyangsik (Dapo-style) single-tiered gabled roof. <br><br>Girimsa is famous for Ojongsu, water that is said to have five different tastes. It consists of gamrosu, which is best for making tea; hwajeongsu, which supposedly gives comfort to the drinker; janggunsu, which makes the body stronger; myeongansu, which gives clear vision; and otaksu, which is said to sparkle so brightly that it attracts all the birds of the air. During Japanese colonial rule, the source of janggunsu, literally meaning ‚Äòwater of a general,‚Äô was reportedly blocked off by Japanese soldiers, who were afraid the water would give the Korean people the strength to overthrow them. Except for janggunsu, water still continues to flow from each source. <br>On the way to Girimsa temple is Golgulsa Temple, well known for its 12 grottos. Golgulsa was originally a hermitage of Girimsa. After becoming an independent institution, it became the center of Seonmudo practice in Korea. The temple aims to promote the art of seonmudo on a national and international level.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-54-744-2292|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Winter season 08:00-17:00 / Summer season 08:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Sedans 1,000 won / Large-sized cars 2,000 won / Buses 3,000 won|\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 3,000 won / Teenagerss  2,000 won / Children 1,500 won<br>Groups - Adults 3,000 won / Teenagers 1,500 won / Children 1,200 won<br><br> * Groups: 20 people or more (not valid for adults)<br>* Free admission: senior citizens (ages 65 & older), people with a disability|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Not available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-25-1669361755171/179594_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-25-1669361755171/179594_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-25-1669361755171/179596_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-25-1669361755171/179596_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-25-1669361755171/179597_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-25-1669361755171/179597_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-25-1669361755171/179603_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-25-1669361755171/179603_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-25-1669361755171/1201008_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-25-1669361755171/1201008_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-25-1669361755171/1201013_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-25-1669361755171/1201013_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-25-1669361755171/1201041_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-25-1669361755171/1201041_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-25-1669361755171/1201050_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-25-1669361755171/1201050_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-25-1669361755171/179595_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-25-1669361755171/179595_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-25-1669361755171/179602_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-25-1669361755171/179602_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-54-744-2292](tel:+82547442292)\n- [üè†kirimsa.net</a> (Korean only)<br><a href=\"https://www.templestay.com/temple_info.asp?t_id=kirimsa\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"web\">www.templestay.com](http://www.kirimsa.net/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.8381387201\nlongitude: 129.4034954028\ntitle: 437-17, Girim-ro, Gyeongju-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br> From \nDong Seoul Terminal, take a bus to Gyeongju Bus Terminal. <br>- Take city bus no. \n100 or 150 towards Gampo or Yangnam and get off near \nYangbuk-myeon Eoil-ri. <br>\n- Take a taxi (cost approximately 6,000 won)\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-25-1669361755171","title":"Girimsa Temple (Í∏∞Î¶ºÏÇ¨)","description":"Girimsa Temple is located in Hamwolsan Mountain in Yangbuk-myeon, Gyeongju.
