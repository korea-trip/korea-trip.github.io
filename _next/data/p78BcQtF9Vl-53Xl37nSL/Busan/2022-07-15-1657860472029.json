Originally a protected area, entrance was not permitted until its opening to the public in 1996, when visitors could first experience the untouched landscape. Now, visitors can fish, explore the observatory, and enjoy the walking path and the elevated bridge. The abundunt pine trees along the walking path make for a pleasant stroll while the path up to the observatory offers great views. If it is fishing that you want, here you can fish on the ocean as well as off the fantastically shaped rocks.  There is also a famous road to go for a drive, leading from Songdo Beach to Amnam Park. This drive takes approximately 5 minutes, but it takes about 20 minutes on foot.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-51-240-4538|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Available Facilities:|Sculptures, square, octagonal pavilion, fishing area, observatory, sports facilities (tennis, gateball, inline skating), drinking fountain, etc.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-15-1657860472029/1572116_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-15-1657860472029/1572116_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-15-1657860472029/1572117_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-15-1657860472029/1572117_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-15-1657860472029/1572118_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-15-1657860472029/1572118_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-15-1657860472029/1572119_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-15-1657860472029/1572119_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-15-1657860472029/1572120_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-15-1657860472029/1572120_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-15-1657860472029/1572122_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-15-1657860472029/1572122_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-15-1657860472029/1572123_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-15-1657860472029/1572123_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-15-1657860472029/1572124_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-15-1657860472029/1572124_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-15-1657860472029/1572125_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-15-1657860472029/1572125_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-15-1657860472029/1572129_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-15-1657860472029/1572129_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-51-240-4538](tel:+82512404538)\n- [üè†culture.bsseogu.go.kr](http://culture.bsseogu.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.0616492424\nlongitude: 129.0151037432\ntitle: 185, Amnamgongwon-ro, Seo-gu, Busan\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway + Bus]<br>\nJagalchi Station (Busan Subway Line 1), Exit 2.<br>Turn left at the corner, and cross the road,  go for 70m to arrive at the bus stop.<br>Take Bus No. 7, 9 or 71, and get off at Amnam Park Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-15-1657860472029","title":"Amnam Park (Î∂ÄÏÇ∞ ÏïîÎÇ®Í≥µÏõê)","description":"The magnificent cliffs and tree-lined seaside views of Amnam Park bring the harmony of the bluish-green waters and the forested landscape together.

The street is popular amongst booklovers for their used books as well as new books, and amongst travelers for the street‚Äôs unique atmosphere.

However, major renovations took place ahead of the first Busan International Film Festival (BIFF), and the newly transformed district was named BIFF Square on August 14, 1996.<br><br> Having been remade into a&nbsp;cultural tourist attraction promoting the advancement of Korea‚Äôs film industry, BIFF Square has contributed to Busan‚Äôs newfound status as an international cultural tourist city. The 428 meter-long street stretching from the Buyeong Theater in Nampo-dong to the overpass in Chungmu-dong was divided into ‚ÄúStar Street‚Äù and ‚ÄúFestival Street,‚Äù and on the eve of the festival each year the ‚ÄúBIFF Square Ground Opening‚Äù is held on the street. During the ceremony, events such as the hand printing of famous movie celebrities and Nunggot Jeomdeung (snow-flower lighting) take place. A district such as BIFF Square, crowded with first-run theaters in a city is rare not only in Asia but Europe as well, and for this reason it holds great potential. In recent years, the square has grown into a more complex area, featuring not only movie theaters but also shops and leisure facilities, attracting growing numbers of young visitors and tourists.","regDate":"2022-07-15","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Busan","Culture/Art/History","Experience Programs","Cultural Districts"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-15-1657864539142/2364283_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Busan/2022-07-15-1657864539142"}],"navList":["Busan","Daegu","Daejeon","Gwangju","Incheon","Seoul"]},"__N_SSG":true}
