The monument was erected in 1914 in memory of missionary Clement Owen who, together with Priest Bae Yoo-ji, was the first missionary to come to Jeollanam-do. The monument was built using the 4,200 dollars collected by Owen’s relatives in the USA after Owen died as a martyr in Gwangju. <br><br>Clement Owen came to Yangnim-dong, Gwangju in the 1900s and served as a missionary and medical volunteer with his wife, who was a nurse, before dying of exhaustion and overwork in 1909. Owen had hoped to build a memorial hospital in honor of his grandfather, but died before his plan was materialized. The plaque hanging in the hall honors both men in English and Chinese, reading, “In Memory of William L. and Clement C. Owen.”<br><br>A Western-style building with a total footage of around 1,435 meters squared (including the annex building), the monument is said to have been used as chapel and assembly room. Today, the building serves as the auditorium of the Christian College of Nursing. The white, two-story building features a lectern in one corner, with two columns of pews facing the lectern. The second floor balcony stretches along the two walls opposite the lectern.","regDate":"2022-07-14","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gwangju","Culture/Art/History","Architectural Sights","Monuments/Observatories"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-14-1657824194098/2493589_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gwangju/2022-07-14-1657824194098"},{"id":"2022-07-14-1657820844710","title":"Mudeungsan National Park (무등산국립공원)","description":"Mudeungsan National Park is a mountain park lining the edge of Hwasun-gun, Damyang-gun and Gwangju.

Known as the oldest surviving Western-style house in Gwangju, the house is an icon of modern culture and architecture in Korea. The house was built by an American missionary named Wilson in the 1920s (exact date unknown) and was the home of the Wilson family while they stayed in Korea. When the family completed their work in Korea, they sold the house for a very cheap price with the stipulation that the house continued to be used for missionary purposes. The house fell into the possession of the General Assembly of Chonnam Presbyterian Church of Korea in 1986 and now serves as the home office for the Presbyterian Church of Korea. <br><br>The square-shaped house consists of a living room, a family room, a kitchen, and a bathroom (1F), several bedrooms (2F), and storage areas and a boiler room (B1). The fact that the entrance of the house faces east is said to be a result of the prevailing architectural culture of Korea at that time. A Netherland-style house built with 55-milimeter thick, gray bricks, the first and second stories are delineated on the exterior with an eye-catching band of bricks.","regDate":"2022-07-14","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gwangju","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Old Houses"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-14-1657818014893/2493617_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gwangju/2022-07-14-1657818014893"},{"id":"2022-07-14-1657813318676","title":"May 18th National Cemetery (국립 5.18 민주묘지)","description":"The May 18th National Cemetery in Gwangju is a symbol of freedom and democracy.
