The island served as an important stopover point for ambassadors and envoys heading to China. Popular attractions on the island now include Daeryong Market, an alleyway market decorated with colorful murals and statues, and Manghyangdae Memorial, a gathering place for refugees who fled from the nearby Hwanghaedo Island during the Korean War. Many of the houses on Gyodongdo Island have swallow nests under the eaves. The refugees consider the swallows as guests from their hometowns. As such, the island is home to the peace & reunion themed Gyodong Swallow House, Peace Trail, and Gyodong Studio. Gyodong Swallow House serves as an exhibition and performance space. The Peace Trail is a biking path around the island. At Gyodong Studio, visitors can put on old school uniforms and take black-and-white photographs.","regDate":"2022-08-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-13-1660368996299/1890654_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-08-13-1660368996299"},{"id":"2022-08-13-1660357888699","title":"Baemikkumi Sculpture Park (Î∞∞ÎØ∏Íæ∏ÎØ∏Ï°∞Í∞ÅÍ≥µÏõê)","description":"Baemikkumi Sculpture Park rests on Modo Island, one of the nearest islets to Yeongjongdo Island where Incheon International Airport is located.<br><br>The name 'baemikkumi' comes from the local dialect, as people say the island resembles the shape of a hole normally seen from the bottom of a ship as 'baemit' translates to the bilge, and 'kkumi' is most closely translated to mean 'a hole' in English. <br><br>The entire island has now become a beautiful exhibition hall of art works thanks to sculptor Lee Il-ho, who originally started and donated his talents for visitors coming to the island.

Its architectural features include a paljak (traditional Korean half-hipped roof) and supporting columns  rendered in Jusimpo style, the column brackets  placed only on top of the columns. The palace was built in the tradition of dwelling houses such as the Yeongyeongdang and Nakseonjae houses in Changdeokgung Palace, so the palace buildings give off a simple and plain atmosphere. Within the precincts of the palace are a memorial stone and a monument house indicating that the palace used to be the old home of King Cheoljong.","regDate":"2022-08-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Old Houses"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-12-1660343994183/1575640_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-08-12-1660343994183"},{"id":"2022-08-12-1660340265213","title":"Yeonpyeongdo Island (Ïó∞ÌèâÎèÑ(ÎåÄ/ÏÜå Ïó∞ÌèâÎèÑ))","description":"Yeonpyeongdo Island is a small island resided by fishing communities. Despite the tragic incident of November 2010 shelling from North Korea, this bucolic island offers many natural and cultural attractions.<br><br><b>Island History<br></b>The earliest known history of Socheongdo Island comes from Chungmin-sa Temple, which was built to commemorate the island's once abundant but now extinct fish species called Yellow corbina (Sciaenidae). This fish was related to the family of fish commonly called drums, croakers, or hardheads for the repetitive throbbing or drumming sounds they make. When the economy flourished thanks to profitable fishing, the Socheongdo port was congested with fishing boats, so much that it was said that one could cross from one island to the next by walking over boats. The species of fish is depleted, and the island remains as quiet with views of North Korea.<br><br>In November 2010, Socheongdo Island was hit by the fatal shelling from North Korea that killed two civilians and two soldiers. In recent months, the island has made an attempt to recover its tourism industry and to develop security tourism by blending its newer military presence at tourist attractions.","regDate":"2022-08-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-12-1660340265213/1385383_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-08-12-1660340265213"},{"id":"2022-08-12-1660336750306","title":"Yeonan Pier (Ïó∞ÏïàÎ∂ÄÎëê)","description":"Yeonan Pier is the starting point for all coastal passenger ships bound for the numerous islands in the western sea.
