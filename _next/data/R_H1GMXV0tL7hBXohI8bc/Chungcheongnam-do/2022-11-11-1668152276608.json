This temple enshrines a Seokjomireukbosalipsang Buddha (Treasure), which was built over the course of 38 years, beginning in 967 during the Goryeo period. According to legend, while a lady was picking fernbrake on Banyasan Mountain, she heard a baby crying. When she went&nbsp;over, there was no baby but instead was a large rock sticking out from the ground. Upon hearing this story, the government ordered a Buddha statue to be made from the rock. This Buddha statue, widely known as ‘Eunjimireuk Buddha,’ is the largest stone Buddha in Korea (18.12 meters in x_height, 9.9 meters in girth, 1.8 meters in the length of ears, 2.43 meters at the x_height of crown). There are many other cultural heritages in this temple and every April, a splendid cherry blossom tunnel stretching from Nonsan to Gwanchoksa Temple is at its peak.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-41-1330<BR> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-41-736-5700|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A Open all year round|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|[Individuals]<br> Adults 1,500 won / Teenagers 1,200 won / Children 800 won <br> <br> [Groups] <br> Adults 1,000 won / Teenagers 1,000 won / Children 700 won <br> <br> * Adults (ages 19 and older) / Teenages (middle & high school students) / Children (ages 7 to 12)<br> * Free admission for senior citizens (ages 65 and older) <br>* Groups: 30 or more people|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-11-1668152276608/1278837_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668152276608/1278837_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-11-1668152276608/1278845_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668152276608/1278845_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-11-1668152276608/1279014_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668152276608/1279014_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-11-1668152276608/1279034_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668152276608/1279034_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-11-1668152276608/1278772_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668152276608/1278772_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-11-1668152276608/1278778_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668152276608/1278778_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-11-1668152276608/1278780_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668152276608/1278780_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-11-1668152276608/1278785_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668152276608/1278785_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-11-1668152276608/1278808_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668152276608/1278808_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-11-1668152276608/1278827_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668152276608/1278827_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-41-736-5700](tel:+82417365700)\n- [🏠gwanchoksa.modoo.at](http://gwanchoksa.modoo.at/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.1888348777\nlongitude: 127.1136855228\ntitle: 25, Gwanchok-ro 1beon-gil, Nonsan-si, Chungcheongnam-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-11-1668152276608","title":"Nonsan Gwanchoksa Temple (관촉사(논산))","description":"Gwanchoksa Temple in Nonsan, Chungcheongnam-do is located at the foot of&nbsp;Banyasan Mountain (100 meters in elevation).
