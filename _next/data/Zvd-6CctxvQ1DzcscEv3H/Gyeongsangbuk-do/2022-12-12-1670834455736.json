The mountain features deep valleys and many sheer rock cliffs to make it the third largest rocky mountain in the country. Juwangsan Mountain was recognized as a tourist attraction on May 30, 1972 and became the 12th national park a few years later on March 30, 1976. The park is quite small, filling in an area of just 105.582 „é¢ but is great for a leisure walk with walking trails in place along the valleys up to waterfalls.<br><br>Juwangsan Mountain was called Seokbyeongsan Mountain during the Silla dynasty due to the many stone peaks jutting out, but has been called Juwangsan Mountain since the Unified Silla period. In addition to these tall rocky peaks, Juwangsan National Park also includes four waterfalls, caves, Daejeonsa Temple and other attractions for a comprehensive tourist site.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-54-870-5300|\n|parking:|Available (Sangui Parking Lot at the entrance of Juwanggyegok Valley)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Night-time Hike Restriction Notice:|To protect the environment and ensure the safety of hikers, hiking is prohibited at night (from sunset until two hours before sunrise).|\n|Mountain Not Access Period:|* TBD by park rangers based on weather advisories, snow/precipitation levels, and other local conditions.
