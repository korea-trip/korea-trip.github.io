In 1434, while the pavilion was undergoing reconstruction, scholar and politician Jeong In-ji called it Gwanghallu after Gwanghancheongheobu, the mythical palace on the moon. Designated as Treasure No. 281, the pavilion is one of four major pavilions known for excellent craftsmanship, along with Yeongnamnu Pavilion (Miryang), Chokseongnu Pavilion (Jinju), and Bubyeoknu (Pyeongyang).
