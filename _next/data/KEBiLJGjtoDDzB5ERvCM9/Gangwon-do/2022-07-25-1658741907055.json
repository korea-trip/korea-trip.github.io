Along Gangneung's most famous food street the beans are ground for Chodang dubu, then through several steps, salt water from the East Sea is used in the congealing process resulting in a soft and light tofu.  The name of this village, Chodang, originates from the name of a famous family that once lived here known as Chodang-Heoyeop.  Heoyeop was the father of son, writer/poet Heo-gyun [1569~1618] and daughter, poet Heonan-seolheon [1563~1589].  A traditional-style Korean house has been reconstructed on the site where the original house of Heo-gyun and Heonan-seolheon once stood.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(English, Korean, Japanese, Chinese)<br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-33-640-4414|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-25-1658741907055/1022426_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658741907055/1022426_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658741907055/203503_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658741907055/203503_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658741907055/2365224_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658741907055/2365224_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658741907055/2365225_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658741907055/2365225_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658741907055/2365226_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658741907055/2365226_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658741907055/2365227_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658741907055/2365227_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658741907055/2365228_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658741907055/2365228_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658741907055/551894_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658741907055/551894_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-33-640-4414](tel:+82336404414)\n- [üè†gnchodangdubu.modoo.at](http://gnchodangdubu.modoo.at)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.7931115115\nlongitude: 128.9170802756\ntitle: 99, Chodangsundubu-gil, Gangneung-si, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n<b>Bus<br></b> From Gangneung Intercity Bus Terminal, take bus  206,  207 or 230.
