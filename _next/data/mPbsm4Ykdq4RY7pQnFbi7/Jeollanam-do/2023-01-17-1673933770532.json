He was a scholar of the late Joseon dynasty and is noted for his great contributions to the development of practical learning in Korea. After he was expelled to Ganjin for writing a secret letter of appeal for religious freedom, which later was named ‘the Hwang Sa-yeong Baekseo’, he lived in the house for 18 years while studying practical learning (‘Silhak’ in Korean). Most of his famous books were written in Dasan Chodang. While walking along a road near Dasan Chodang, you can see the Cheonilgak pavilion, which offers a great view of beautiful Gangjin Bay. Not far from Dasan Chodang is the Dasan Museum, where visitors can learn about the life of Dasan.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-61-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-61-430-3363|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-17-1673933770532/192513_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-17-1673933770532/192513_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-17-1673933770532/192517_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-17-1673933770532/192517_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-17-1673933770532/192518_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-17-1673933770532/192518_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-17-1673933770532/566960_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-17-1673933770532/566960_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-17-1673933770532/1606645_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-17-1673933770532/1606645_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-17-1673933770532/1606646_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-17-1673933770532/1606646_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-17-1673933770532/1606647_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-17-1673933770532/1606647_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-17-1673933770532/1606648_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-17-1673933770532/1606648_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-17-1673933770532/2372851_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-17-1673933770532/2372851_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-17-1673933770532/1606649_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-17-1673933770532/1606649_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-61-430-3363](tel:+82614303363)\n- [🏠www.gangjin.go.kr</a> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> <a title=\"New window popup\" class=\"web\" href=\"http://www.cha.go.kr/\" target=\"_blank\">www.cha.go.kr](http://www.gangjin.go.kr/culture/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 34.5790442458\nlongitude: 126.7462228308\ntitle: 68-35, Dasanchodang-gil, Gangjin-gun, Jeollanam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Central City Express Bus Terminal, take a bus to Gangjin Bus Terminal.<br>\nFrom Gangjin Bus Terminal Bus Stop, take a local bus for Mangho or Songhak and get off at Dasan Chodang Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-17-1673933770532","title":"Dasan Chodang (Historic Site Related to Jeong Yak-yong) (다산초당 (다산 정약용 유적지))","description":"Dasan Chodang is the house where Jeong Yak-yong (pen-name Dasan, 1762-1836) lived during his exile.
