This unique formation and the ecosystem that came to live on the sand bar are highly valued.

The lake is in the shape of a figure eight, with the southern lake being larger than the northern lake, although the northern lake is still connected with the ocean through a small stream.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-33-249-3881|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Film Locations:|Drama \"Autumn in My Heart (2000)\"<br>Film \"Failan (2001)\"|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-09-29-1664448510322/1581490_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-29-1664448510322/1581490_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-29-1664448510322/1581492_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-29-1664448510322/1581492_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-29-1664448510322/1581493_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-29-1664448510322/1581493_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-29-1664448510322/1813110_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-29-1664448510322/1813110_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-29-1664448510322/1813113_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-29-1664448510322/1813113_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-29-1664448510322/1906630_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-29-1664448510322/1906630_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-33-249-3881](tel:+82332493881)\n- [🏠www.koreadmz.kr</a><br><a href=\"http://hwajinpobeach.co.kr/\" target=\"_blank\">hwajinpobeach.co.kr](http://www.koreadmz.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 38.4788446862\nlongitude: 128.4391216433\ntitle: Hyeonnae-myeon, Goseong-gun, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-09-29-1664448510322","title":"Hwajinpo Beach [National Geopark] (화진포 (강원평화지역 국가지질공원))","description":"Hwajinpo Lake is the largest lagoon in Korea, created by a section of the ocean being closed off when two opposing sand spits merged.

The lake is a hotspot for aquatic tourism and the lakeside road is an important route that connects Chuncheon and Yanggu. Driving from Chuncheon to the dam will take about one hour, but the Kwaeryongho Boat, a hovercraft that operates regularly on Soyangho Lake, only takes about 30 minutes. The hovercraft travels by ejecting air against the surface below, sending up a spray of water on either side of the boat to the delight of passengers. In the valley, visitors can see fish farms floating among the islets. When the water level is high, it is possible to travel on the lake all the way to Inje and Sinnam, enjoying the beautiful scenery of Seoraksan Mountain. Both tourists and locals regularly make use of the ferry service.","regDate":"2022-10-14","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-14-1665729241153/176171_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-14-1665729241153"},{"id":"2022-10-14-1665723965765","title":"Soyangho Lake (Inje Section) (소양호-인제)","description":"Soyangho Lake (소양호), one of the biggest manmade lakes in Korea, along with Chungjuho Lake (충주호), was created in 1973 when the world’s fourth largest dam, Soyang Dam, standing 123 meters high, was constructed.
