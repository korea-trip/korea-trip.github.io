It is a home to numerous alpine tree species, as well as wildflowers and herbs. Its trails are popular thanks to the gentle slopes. Gariwangsan National Recreational Forest is located at the Hoedong-ri Village entrance. The recreational forest has various amenities, but the walking path next to the valley is by far the most outstanding. The thick forest blocks out the sky while purifying the air.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-33-562-5833|\n|parking:|Available|\n|usetime:|[Accommodations] Check in 15:00 / Check out 12:00<br>[Park hours] 09:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Camping sites, cabins, recreation hall, etc.|\n|Parking Fees:|Compact cars: 1,500 won<br>Small & mid-sized vehicles: 3,000 won<br>Large vehicles: 5,000 won|\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 1,000 won / Teenagers 600 won / Children 300 won<br>Groups - Adults 800 won / Teenagers 500 won / Children 200 won<br><br>* Adults (ages 19-64) / Teenagers (ages 13-18) / Children (ages 7-12)<br>* Free admission during winter season (December-March)<br>* Free admission: Senior citizens (ages 65 & older), preschoolers (ages 6 & younger)|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582540_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582540_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582544_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582544_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582546_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582546_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582613_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582613_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582615_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582615_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582616_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582616_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582617_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582617_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582916_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582916_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582922_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582922_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582536_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582536_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-33-562-5833](tel:+82335625833)\n- [üè†www.foresttrip.go.kr](https://www.foresttrip.go.kr/indvz/main.do?hmpgId=0113)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.4268471267\nlongitude: 128.5700393556\ntitle: 707, Gariwangsan-ro, Jeongseon-gun, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Taxi]<br>\nApprox. 25 min from Jeongseon Bus Terminal.\n","data":{"id":"2022-09-23-1663926372349","title":"Gariwangsan National Recreational Forest (Íµ≠Î¶Ω Í∞ÄÎ¶¨ÏôïÏÇ∞ÏûêÏó∞Ìú¥ÏñëÎ¶º)","description":"Gariwangsan Mountain is one of the major mountains in the Taebaek Mountain Range.

Driving from Chuncheon to the dam will take about one hour, but the Kwaeryongho Boat, a hovercraft that operates regularly on Soyangho Lake, only takes about 30 minutes. The hovercraft travels by ejecting air against the surface below, sending up a spray of water on either side of the boat to the delight of passengers. In the valley, visitors can see fish farms floating among the islets. When the water level is high, it is possible to travel on the lake all the way to Inje and Sinnam, enjoying the beautiful scenery of Seoraksan Mountain. Both tourists and locals regularly make use of the ferry service.","regDate":"2022-10-14","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-14-1665729241153/176171_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-14-1665729241153"},{"id":"2022-10-14-1665723965765","title":"Soyangho Lake (Inje Section) (ÏÜåÏñëÌò∏-Ïù∏Ï†ú)","description":"Soyangho Lake (ÏÜåÏñëÌò∏), one of the biggest manmade lakes in Korea, along with Chungjuho Lake (Ï∂©Ï£ºÌò∏), was created in 1973 when the world‚Äôs fourth largest dam, Soyang Dam, standing 123 meters high, was constructed.
