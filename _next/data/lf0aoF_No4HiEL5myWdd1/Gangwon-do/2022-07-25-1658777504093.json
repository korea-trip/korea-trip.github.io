There are many ranches in Pyeongchang, but Daegwallyeong Sheep Ranch is the only ranch that raises sheep. The sheep grazing field is surrounded by a 1.2 meter-long circular walkway, so visitors can view the sheep at all times during their visit. It takes about 40 minutes to walk along this path. A wooden shack located in the field appeared as a backdrop of the movie \"The Man from Mars.\"  The wooden shack fits perfectly with the sheep farm, and has become a popular photo site. To get a closer experience with the sheep, sign up for the feeding experience, where you can give hay to the sheep and even reach out to touch their fuzzy heads.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-33-335-1966|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|The day of Seollal (Lunar New Year's Day) & Chuseok (Korean Thanksgiving Day)<br>* May close in the case of adverse weather such as heavy snow, rain or thunderstorms; please call in advance.|\n|usetime:|November-February 09:00-17:00<br>March & October 09:00-17:30<br>April & September 09:00-18:00<br>May-August 09:00-18:30<br>* Last admission is 16:30.<br>* Hours are subject to change depending on weather or conditions on-site.|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Shopping Information:|Food & gifts available|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Admission Fees:|[Individuals]<br>Adults: 6,000 won / Children: 4,000 won / Senior citizens: 3,000 won<br><br>[Groups]<br>Adults: 5,000 won / Children: 3,500 won / Senior citizens: 3,000 won<br> <br>* Groups: 20 people or more<br>* Adults (ages 19-64), Children (ages 4-18), Senior citizens (ages 65 and older)<br>* Free admission: Preschoolers (ages 3 or under) / Free admission does not apply to groups of children<br>* Seniors citizens: ID required|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Sheep feeding area, royal azalea field, thached-roof house, marsh, walking trails, rest area, etc.|\n|Reservation Info. for Natives:|Reservations not accepted|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1583621_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1583621_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1583624_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1583624_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1583625_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1583625_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1583627_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1583627_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1890726_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1890726_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1890727_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1890727_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1890728_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1890728_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1890729_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1890729_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1890731_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1890731_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-33-335-1966](tel:+82333351966)\n- [üè†www.yangtte.co.kr]( http://www.yangtte.co.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.6876427505\nlongitude: 128.7533288363\ntitle: 483-32, Daegwallyeongmaru-gil, Pyeongchang-gun, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus + Taxi]<br>\nFrom Dong Seoul Bus Terminal, take an intercity bus to Hoenggye Intercity Bus Terminal.<br>From Hoenggye Bus Terminal, take a taxi to the ranch.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-25-1658777504093","title":"Daegwallyeong Sheep Ranch (ÎåÄÍ¥ÄÎ†π ÏñëÎñºÎ™©Ïû•)","description":"Daegwallyeong Sheep Ranch is a privately owned ranch on an area of 195 k„é°.

It was designated as Koreas fifth national park in 1970 after the designation of Hallyeohaesang National Park, and as Koreas first UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1982. It has been also registered in the IUCN Green List of Protected and Conserved Areas, which is the global standard of best practice for area-based conservation. Having Daecheongbong Peak as the mountains main peak, Seoraksan National Park, with a total area of 398 km¬≤, is divided  into the outer section (Oeseorak, eastern section), the inner section (Naeseorak, western section), and the southern section (Namseorak). Daecheongbong Peak (1,708 m) is the third highest peak in Korea after Hallasan Mountain and Jirisan Mountain, and as the peak is covered with snow for five to six months of the year, the mountain got the name Seorak (meaning a snowy peak). The summit of Daecheongbong Peak commands the magnificent natural landscape of Seoraksan Mountain and the East Sea. In particular, it is known for the fantastic views of the sunrise and sunset. In addition to Daecheongbong Peak, Seoraksan Mountain has some 30 grand peaks, such as Socheongbong, Hwachaebong, and Jungcheongbong. The mountain is also full of hidden scenic views of Biryongpokpo Falls, Ulsan Peak, Heundeulbawi Rock, and Geumganggul Cave. By using the cable car near Seoraksan Small Park, the disabled and the elderly can go up to the top and enjoy a panoramic view of the mountain.","regDate":"2022-10-26","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites","National Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-26-1666777389811/2677663_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-26-1666777389811"},{"id":"2022-10-26-1666774080396","title":"Seoraksan Daecheongbong Peak (ÏÑ§ÏïÖ ÎåÄÏ≤≠Î¥â)","description":"This 1,708 m-high peak is the highest peak of Seoraksan Mountain and the third highest in the Republic of Korea, behind Hallasan Mountain (1,950 m) and Jirisan Mountain (1,915 m).

It is also the origin of most of Seoraksan Mountain‚Äôs famous valleys, like Cheonbuldong and Gayadong Valleys. Because of erratic weather and low temperature, Daecheongbong Peak is often covered in snow from late October to late spring. Its ridges are populated by Siberian dwarf pine, Hairy Korean rhododendron, Ermans birch, and subalpine trees, making it a valuable source for alpine plant research. Four trails in the Seoraksan National Park take the visitors to this peak, through Osaek, Baekdam, Seorak-dong, and Osaengnyeong (Hangyeryeong) Pass. The shortest trail is the 5 km-long Osaek Trail (Osaek ‚Äì Seorak Falls ‚Äì Daecheongbong Peak), taking about 4 hr in total. The management controls entry to Seoraksan National Park depending on weather conditions and period, so visitors are advised to check the real-time information provided at its webpage (www.knps.or.kr).","regDate":"2022-10-26","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-26-1666774080396/780821_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-26-1666774080396"},{"id":"2022-10-26-1666770117736","title":"Robot Studio (ÌÜ†Ïù¥Î°úÎ¥áÍ¥Ä)","description":"Robot Studio is an experiential exhibition hall that presents a vision of the future robotics, featuring experiment robots, robot avatars, and reproduction of movie scenes.

The people of Yangyang know the pass as Osaengnyeong, while in Inje it is known as Hangyeryeong. Yi Jung-hwan, a late Joseon period scholar and the author of the geographical text Taengniji (On Selecting a Village), counted Osaengnyeong Pass as the first and the foremost of the six famous passes in Gangwon-do. Indeed, Osaengnyeong Pass was the route through which essential supplies were transported from Yangyang (in Yeongdong) to Inje (in Yeongseo region), and the rough pass taken by the people of Yangyang on the way to Seoul. Its presence in the folklore of the region can be seen in the popular song Hangyeryeong, which speaks to the difficulties of those who had to climb the pass. Hangyeryeong Road was opened in 1981, and today‚Äôs National Road No. 44 is famous for being a driving course through the beauty of Seoraksan Mountain. This is also the starting point of the shortest route to Daecheongbong Peak, the highest peak in Seoraksan Mountain, and the trail to the summit of Jeombongsan Mountain.","regDate":"2022-10-25","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-25-1666695146080/182107_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-25-1666695146080"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
