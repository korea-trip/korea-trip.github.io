Connecting with the water bridge section of the bike path, Uiamho Lake Skywalk consists of a 10 m-long straight section and a 10 m-diameter circular section, located 12 m above the water. The entire floor is made of transparent glass, so visitors will feel like walking on the water. When you stand on the skywalk, you will encounter a picturesque view of Samaksan Mountain and Uiamho Lake. Soyanggang Skywalk boasts another splendid scenery of Chuncheon. Although the access from the Kim Youjeong Memorial Stone is close to Uiam Lake Skywalk, parking space is insufficient, thus, it is recommended to use the public parking lot near Chuncheon Songam Sports Town. It takes 15 min by foot or bike along the Uiamho Bike Path from the public parking lot to Uiam Lake Skywalk. It is a great place for a stroll amid the magnificent landscape.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-33-250-3089|\n|opendate:|June 14, 2014|\n|parking:|Not allowed(Parking lot of Uiam Ice Rink inside Songam Sports Town)|\n|restdate:|January, February, and December|\n|usetime:|09:00–18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Parking Fees:|Free of charge|\n|Admission Fees:|Free of charge|\n|Restrooms:|None|\n|Available Facilities:|Skywalk above water|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-10-16-1665906295356/2605230_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-16-1665906295356/2605230_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-16-1665906295356/2605231_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-16-1665906295356/2605231_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-16-1665906295356/2605232_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-16-1665906295356/2605232_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-16-1665906295356/2605233_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-16-1665906295356/2605233_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-16-1665906295356/2605234_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-16-1665906295356/2605234_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-16-1665906295356/2605229_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-16-1665906295356/2605229_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-33-250-3089](tel:+82332503089)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.8471622126\nlongitude: 127.6799656772\ntitle: 468-1, Chiljeon-dong, Chuncheon-si, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway/Train]<br>\nChuncheon Station (Gyeongchun Line), Exit 1.<br><br>\n[Taxi]<br>\nApprox. 15 min from Chuncheon Station.\n","data":{"id":"2022-10-16-1665906295356","title":"Uiamho Lake Skywalk (의암호 스카이워크)","description":"Uiamho Lake Skywalk, one of the two largest skywalks in Chuncheon along with Soyanggang Skywalk, is located on Uiamho Bike Path between Kim Youjeong Memorial Stone and Chuncheon Songam Sports Town in the Uiam Lakeside.
