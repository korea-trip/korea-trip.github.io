From the moment you start walking down the stonewall-lined path into town, this small village will capture your heart. The village‚Äôs important history (including its title as the origin of Hampyeong-gun of Jeollanam-do Province) is evident in everything you see  from the traditional houses to the 500-year old forest. The area is home to 27 historical and cultural sites and the beautiful Haebochoen Stream, which is shaded by over 40 different types of trees including zelkova trees, nettle trees, and willow trees. Some of the town‚Äôs traditional houses, which are about 80 years old, offer guesthouse accommodations to tourists. They include Mopyeongheon, Sopungga and Hisomun (a house made of yellow sod).<Br><Br>In addition to the beautiful country scenery, there is a great selection of available programs that highlight the area‚Äôs specialties, including  mulberry-picking, silkworm-feeding and Korean traditional sauce-making. You can also visit a traditional watermill, which has been restored, and swim and splash around in the forest stream. Visitors are encouraged to try their hand at making green tea cakes at the traditional teahouse nearby. <br><Br>The area of Mopyeong is full of things to entertain visitors, including a number of attractions and special events. Some of the area‚Äôs most praiseworthy attractions are the Hampyeong Butterfly Festival, the Cluster Amaryllis Festival in Yongcheonsa Temple, the Chrysanthemum Festival, and the Hampyeong Eco Park and Folk Museum. <br><Br>Other towns well worth a visit in the Mopyeong area are Hamo Maeul, Ungok Maeul and Wonsan Maeul. A stay at Wonsan Maeul gives visitors a chance to experience firsthand the reality of an agricultural lifestyle by doing some activities like mulberry-picking. For a more low-key trip, make your way over to Ungok Maeul, where you can enjoy the fantastic scenery at the lake or take a relaxing walk along the hiking trails of Mt. Wolyangsan.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-61-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-61-320-1783|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Accommodations|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-26-1674715167198/1608253_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-26-1674715167198/1608253_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-26-1674715167198/1608254_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-26-1674715167198/1608254_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-26-1674715167198/1608255_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-26-1674715167198/1608255_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-26-1674715167198/1810075_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-26-1674715167198/1810075_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-26-1674715167198/1810077_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-26-1674715167198/1810077_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-26-1674715167198/1810082_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-26-1674715167198/1810082_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-26-1674715167198/1810086_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-26-1674715167198/1810086_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-26-1674715167198/1810098_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-26-1674715167198/1810098_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-26-1674715167198/1810099_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-26-1674715167198/1810099_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-26-1674715167198/1608251_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-26-1674715167198/1608251_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-61-320-2772](tel:+82613202772)\n- [üè†hampyeong.go.kr](https://hampyeong.go.kr/tour/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.1604068068\nlongitude: 126.5943525751\ntitle: 80, Sangmo-gil, Hampyeong-gun, Jeollanam-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-26-1674715167198","title":"Mopyeong Village (Î™®ÌèâÎßàÏùÑ)","description":"Located in Hampyeong-gun, Jeollanamdo, Mopyeong Village is a scenic farming village that is rich in tradition and history.

Unfortunately, most of the temple buildings have been destroyed and only the main hall, Daeungjeon Hall, and a few smaller structures such as the living quarters remain on site today. The temple was originally called Ssanggyesa Temple because the waters of two valleys meet in front of this temple. It was renamed Jeongsusa Temple during the latter part of the Joseon dynasty (1392-1905).<br><br>The temple was reportedly established by the state monk Doseon-guksa in the first year of the reign of Silla Kingdom‚Äôs King Aejang (800). However, the temple‚Äôs founding year preceded the monk‚Äôs year of birth so there seems to have been a mistake in the year of foundation. Daeungjeon, the main hall, has three rooms in the front and two on the sides with a gambrel roof. Designated as Jeollanam-do Tangible Cultural Property, the structure features a modest and simple architecture that is estimated to date back to the latter half of the Joseon dynasty.","regDate":"2023-02-04","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollanam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Jeollanam-do/2023-02-04-1675506964115"},{"id":"2023-02-04-1675503361164","title":"Jeamsan Recreational Forest (Ï†úÏïîÏÇ∞ÏûêÏó∞Ìú¥ÏñëÎ¶º)","description":"Jeamsan Mountain is beautiful throughout the year with royal azaleas in spring, cool water in summer, silver grass in fall, and a snow-covered mountain in winter.
