Unfortunately, most of the temple buildings have been destroyed and only the main hall, Daeungjeon Hall, and a few smaller structures such as the living quarters remain on site today. The temple was originally called Ssanggyesa Temple because the waters of two valleys meet in front of this temple. It was renamed Jeongsusa Temple during the latter part of the Joseon dynasty (1392-1905).<br><br>The temple was reportedly established by the state monk Doseon-guksa in the first year of the reign of Silla Kingdom’s King Aejang (800). However, the temple’s founding year preceded the monk’s year of birth so there seems to have been a mistake in the year of foundation. Daeungjeon, the main hall, has three rooms in the front and two on the sides with a gambrel roof. Designated as Jeollanam-do Tangible Cultural Property, the structure features a modest and simple architecture that is estimated to date back to the latter half of the Joseon dynasty.","regDate":"2023-02-04","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollanam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Jeollanam-do/2023-02-04-1675506964115"},{"id":"2023-02-04-1675503361164","title":"Jeamsan Recreational Forest (제암산자연휴양림)","description":"Jeamsan Mountain is beautiful throughout the year with royal azaleas in spring, cool water in summer, silver grass in fall, and a snow-covered mountain in winter.
