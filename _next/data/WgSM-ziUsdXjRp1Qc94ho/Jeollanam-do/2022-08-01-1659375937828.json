In particular, it is home to Orodae Rock, cool enough to form dew even in the middle of the day and Gusipokpo Falls with a legend of a flying horse.\n<br><br>\nThe valley is located ten minutes away from the Seomjingang River Maehwa Village, and plum trees cover the valley in spring with plum blossoms. In autumn, the countless oak trees in the forest become an acorn factory for its habitats. Baegunsan Eochigyegok Valley is worth visiting at any time of the year and provides various agricultural products to local residents. Orodae Rock, located in the uppermost stream, refers to a rock that looks like a large courtyard. An inscription remains, saying that it is named Orodae because it is cool enough to form dew even in the midday of the summer. Legend says that Gusiso Pool at the base of Gusipokpo Falls is so wide that it will not dry up even in a draught.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-61-797-3333|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-01-1659375937828/1606764_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659375937828/1606764_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659375937828/1606766_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659375937828/1606766_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659375937828/1606767_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659375937828/1606767_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659375937828/1606768_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659375937828/1606768_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659375937828/1606769_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659375937828/1606769_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659375937828/1606771_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659375937828/1606771_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659375937828/2606026_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659375937828/2606026_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-61-797-3333](tel:+82617973333)\n- [üè†www.gwangyang.go.kr](http://www.gwangyang.go.kr/tour_culture/index.gwangyang)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.0579647522\nlongitude: 127.6862532865\ntitle: 531, Baekhak-ro, Gwangyang-si, Jeollanam-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-01-1659375937828","title":"Baegunsan Eochigyegok Valley (Î∞±Ïö¥ÏÇ∞ Ïñ¥ÏπòÍ≥ÑÍ≥°)","description":"Eochigyegok Valley, located in Eochi-ri, Jinsang-myeon, is 7 kilometers long, and is a valley with clear water flowing through the lush forest with rocks in all sizes that provide a resting spot.

Unfortunately, most of the temple buildings have been destroyed and only the main hall, Daeungjeon Hall, and a few smaller structures such as the living quarters remain on site today. The temple was originally called Ssanggyesa Temple because the waters of two valleys meet in front of this temple. It was renamed Jeongsusa Temple during the latter part of the Joseon dynasty (1392-1905).<br><br>The temple was reportedly established by the state monk Doseon-guksa in the first year of the reign of Silla Kingdom‚Äôs King Aejang (800). However, the temple‚Äôs founding year preceded the monk‚Äôs year of birth so there seems to have been a mistake in the year of foundation. Daeungjeon, the main hall, has three rooms in the front and two on the sides with a gambrel roof. Designated as Jeollanam-do Tangible Cultural Property, the structure features a modest and simple architecture that is estimated to date back to the latter half of the Joseon dynasty.","regDate":"2023-02-04","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollanam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Jeollanam-do/2023-02-04-1675506964115"},{"id":"2023-02-04-1675503361164","title":"Jeamsan Recreational Forest (Ï†úÏïîÏÇ∞ÏûêÏó∞Ìú¥ÏñëÎ¶º)","description":"Jeamsan Mountain is beautiful throughout the year with royal azaleas in spring, cool water in summer, silver grass in fall, and a snow-covered mountain in winter.
