So, the lake is an intermediate stop between the river and the sea. Cheongchojeong Pavilion is located above the lake, offering an open view of Seoraksan Mountain and the East Sea. As it is situated at the end of the 75 m-long ocean bridge, you will feel standing in the middle of the lake and enjoy a panoramic view of the lake.
