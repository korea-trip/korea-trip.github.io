Danjong had been stripped of his title at the time he was exiled. His title was later restored in year 1698, during the reign of King Sukjong, and received his posthumous name Danjong, and thereafter was referred to as King Danjong. <br><br>Jangneung houses such buildings as Jeongjagak, Baesikdansa, Jaesil, Yeongcheon, and Hongsammun, and a history hall with relics of Danjong.
