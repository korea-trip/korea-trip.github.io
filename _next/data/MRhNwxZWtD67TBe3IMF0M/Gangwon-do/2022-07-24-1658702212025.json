Because of its excellent scenery, Kim Il-seong of North Korea and the former South Korean President Rhee Syngman and Vice-president Lee Ki-poong had summer houses here.

The flood control dam has proved its worth during the floods of 1995, 1996, and 1999 and it has become a major tourist destination over the years. Located in the vicinity of Peace Dam is Bimok Park, which is the origin of the famous national song “Bimok.”<br><br>In addition to the war monuments inside the park, there are around a dozen wooden crosses with rusty iron helmets placed on top within the barbed wire entanglements around the hill, thereby reminding visitors of the national tragedy of the Korean War. The county of Hwancheon hosts the Bimok Cultural Festival from June 3 to June 6 every year at Bimok Park, Bungeoseom Island by the town’s riverside, and the surrounding areas. The four-day festival offers a variety of events such as a singing contest, memorial ceremony of poetry reading, bimok tree cutting contest, rice ball eating contest, army life experience, military music parade, and more. <br><br>Crossing over to Yanggu County from Peace Dam, there is a national security education place comprised of attractions like the 4th Underground Tunnel and Eulji Observatory. Paroho Lake Battlefield Tourist Park is also worth a visit after looking around Peace Dam. Also known as the “ocean within mountains,” Paroho is a manmade lake created as a result of the Hwacheon Dam construction in 1944. The lake is home to over 70 different species of freshwater fish such as mandarin fish and carp. It also holds the sorrowful history of the water burial of three whole divisions of the Chinese Forces in defending the lake during the Korean War. The name Paroho, meaning “enemy breaking lake,” was given after the late president of Korea, Rhee Syngman, visited the place and designated a plaque in his own handwriting in memory of obtaining victory in fierce battle. There is an observatory, a security hall, and a stone monument engraved with the poetry of Wolha Rhee Taegeuk (1913-2003).","regDate":"2022-09-29","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-29-1664445054593/172387_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-09-29-1664445054593"},{"id":"2022-09-29-1664441824591","title":"Hwaamdonggul Cave [Gangwon Paleozoic Geopark] (화암동굴 (강원고생대 국가지질공원))","description":"Hwaamdonggul Cave was originally a gold mine that was commercially operated from 1922 to 1945 as the nation’s fifth largest gold mine.

The winding road leading to the attractions offers a perfect sencery of the mountains and cliffs, as well as magnificent fall foliage in autumn. Sign posts are installed along the way to each of the sceneries to prevent tourists from getting  lost.<br><br>Scenic Beauty 1  Hwaam Mineral Spring<br>At Hwaam Mineral Spring, water rises up through a rock crater located in Dong-myeon, Jeongseon. The water is said to be good for stomachaches, eye infections, and skin diseases; and, as it contains nine essential elements such as calcium and fluorine, it tastes crisp and clean. <br><br>Scenic Beauty 2  Turtle Rock <br>Part of the path leading to Hwaam Mineral Spring is buttressed by a cliff, on which there is a rock that resembles the shape of a turtle. <br> <br>Scenic Beauty 3  Yongmaso<br>With its clean water and wide sheets of rock, Yongmaso Lake is a popular attraction for vacationers. <br><br>Scenic Beauty 4  Hwaamdonggul Cave<br>Hwaamdonggul Cave used to be a gold mine that was commercially operated from 1922 to 1945. The nation’s 5th largest goldmine was, however, found to have natural stalactites, and later the cave was developed as the only theme-based cave that combined gold and nature. The stalactite area is an open space of 2,800㎡ and the length of the path open to visitors is 1,803 meters. The entire area consists of 5 chapters, which in turn constitute 41 zones; it takes about an hour and a half to see all of the zones. <br><br>Scenic Beauty 5  Hwapyoju Cliff<br>Hwapyoju is a cliff facing the entrance of Hwapyo-dong, which can be seen on the way from Hwaam-dong to Molundae. The cliff may appear as if a giant sharpened a large sheet of rock and placed it upright, or less imaginatively, as if two pillars are standing side by side. <br><br>Scenic Beauty 6  Sogeumgang River<br>The four-kilometer stretch from Hwapyoju to Molundae, surrounded with 100 to 150-meter high rock cliffs and thick forest, is called Sogeumgang River (small Geumgang River), meaning that its beautiful scenery is reminiscent of that of the breathtaking Geumgangsan Mountain.<br><br>Scenic Beauty 7  Molundae Cliff<br>Molundae literally means ‘the cliff beyond which clouds disappear’. The tip of the steep cliff is adorned with three specimens of 500-year-old pine trees. Legend has it that gods would perch on the cliff’s top and enjoy the beautiful view. At the foot of the cliff lies a large sheet of rock that can accommodate hundreds of people. <br><br>Scenic Beauty 8  Gwangdaegok Valley<br>Gwangdaegok Valley is said to be the mysterious place where heaven, earth and clouds meet. The surrounding hills are very rough and bumpy, which makes the area a renowned mountain in Korea. There is a belief among wild-ginseng diggers that they can find great ginseng if they pray in Gwangdaegok, so it is a popular attraction for such prospectors.","regDate":"2022-09-29","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Tourist Complexes"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-29-1664438126298/175712_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-09-29-1664438126298"},{"id":"2022-09-29-1664433599610","title":"Hwaam Mineral Spring [National Geopark] (화암약수 (강원고생대 국가지질공원))","description":"Hwaam Mineral Spring is one of the Eight Scenic Sites of Hwaam, and provides carbonated water said to be good for stomach discomfort and skin diseases.
