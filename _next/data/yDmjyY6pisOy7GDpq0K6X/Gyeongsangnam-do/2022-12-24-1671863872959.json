Unfortunately, the entire premises were lost to a big fire during the night of January 12, 1914, and all the halls and pavilions, including Yosachae, totaling 184 rooms in 12 buildings, were rebuilt in 1917. However, they were damaged once again during the Korean War and were abandoned until the war ended where the temple was rejuvenated and made even bigger. Located nearby are Geoyeonjeong and Gunjajeong Halls that are believed to have been the studying venue of scholars. <br><br> * Daewonsa Valley<br> The two-kilometer-long valley that stretches from the parking lot at the entrance to Daewon Temple to the temple itself is surrounded by high hills and curious-looking rocks. The clean water that oozes out through craters between the rocks generates unusual scenery. Associated with Yongso Pond is the legend that a dragon lived in it for hundreds of&nbsp;years before it finally flew away. Somakgol Valley is known to be the place where the last king of Garak Kingdom came to feed his cows and horses.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-55-972-8068|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Varies by program, check the official website for details|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Tour Course Information:|Naewonsa Temple, Deokcheonseowon Confucian Academy of Nammyeong Josik, Royal Tomb of King Guhyeong, Sancheong Oriental Medicine Theme Park, Cotton Plantation Farm, Partisan Mountain Historic Sites, etc.|\n|Parking Fees:|Free (Note: Parking lot for large-sized buses requires parking fees.)|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Reservation Info. for Foreigners:|Reservation available via phone and homepage|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Available in English |\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-24-1671863872959/793139_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-24-1671863872959/793139_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-24-1671863872959/793141_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-24-1671863872959/793141_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-24-1671863872959/793158_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-24-1671863872959/793158_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-24-1671863872959/793165_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-24-1671863872959/793165_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-24-1671863872959/793146_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-24-1671863872959/793146_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-24-1671863872959/793166_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-24-1671863872959/793166_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-24-1671863872959/793167_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-24-1671863872959/793167_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-55-972-8068](tel:+82559728068)\n- [üè†www.daewonsa.net](http://www.daewonsa.net/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.3554028007\nlongitude: 127.8064933056\ntitle: 453, Pyeongchonyupyeong-ro, Sancheong-gun, Gyeongsangnam-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-24-1671863872959","title":"Sancheong Daewonsa Temple (ÎåÄÏõêÏÇ¨(ÏÇ∞Ï≤≠))","description":"Located at the eastern foot of Jirisan  Mountain, Daewonsa Temple was first built in 548 during the Silla dynasty, but it remained closed for over thousand years until it was renovated and made bigger with the name Daewon.

It was named so because the leaves turn so crimson that the water of the valley reflects the color and appears crimson as well. This is the place where Chi-Won Choe, after returning from Dang China to Silla (BC 57-AD 935) found Korea in disarray. It was too much to bear for him so he retired to live privately with poetry until his death. <br><br>There are 19 famous places in Hongryudonggyegok Valley, including major cultural assets like Jongsangjeong Pavilion, Nakhwadam, and Bunokpok. The scenery of Nongsanjeong Pavilion, where Chi-Won Choe read poetry and played baduk, is especially beautiful.  On the opposite side is a rock where you can see the handwring of Chi-Won Choe. The Yongmunpokpo Falls, located on the north end of the valley, has beautiful scenery with its harmonious blend of falling water and Giamgoiseok (fantastic rocks and stones).  <br><br>The scenery of Hongryudonggyegok Valley changes every season, and it is the finest part of Gayasan Mountain. It is famous for the azaleas in full bloom during the spring, and for the thousand-year-old pine trees and broad-leaved trees growing thickly throughout the valley and the cool, clear water that runs through it during the summer. In the fall, the nearby pine tree forests and broad-leaved trees tinge in color and accentuate the crimson foliage of autumnal leaves, making the crimson reflection of the leaves in the valley water look like a rising flame, and shows why the valley was named Hongryudonggyegok Valley.","regDate":"2022-12-28","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Valleys"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-28-1672212935139/2625847_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-28-1672212935139"},{"id":"2022-12-28-1672209537187","title":"Hapcheon Okgyeseowon Confucian Academy (Ïò•Í≥ÑÏÑúÏõê(Ìï©Ï≤ú))","description":"Hapcheon Okgyeseowon Confucian Academy was built to store Yulgok Yi Is writings, Gyeokmongyogyeol and Haedongyeonwonnok.

The footprints are deeply imprinted in the wide sheets of rocks arrayed along Dongdaeman Beach. Researchers believe that these enormous footprints belong to a species of huge pterosaur, and visitors can see about 60 smaller footprints that are believed to belong to early humans. The dinosaur footprints and other cretaceous fossils are located along the cape by the shore, so you must time your visit well to see them. According to paleontologists, the footprints are the evidence of three specimens of herbivorous  sauropoda, which walked on two 60 centimeter-long feet; two specimens of ornithopoda, which were also herbivores, that had three toes on each foot; and one specimen of another ornithopod species, a carnivore that had sharp claws and walked on two feet. The layout of the footprints alludes to a situation where the herbivores were walking in a group followed by a carnivore preparing for an attack! <br><br>","regDate":"2022-12-27","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Eco-Tourism Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-27-1672133762383/212944_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-27-1672133762383"},{"id":"2022-12-27-1672130246490","title":"DPIRANG (ÎîîÌîºÎûë)","description":"DPIRANG is a digital nighttime theme park in Nammangsan Park that consists of 15 walking paths decorated with lights.
