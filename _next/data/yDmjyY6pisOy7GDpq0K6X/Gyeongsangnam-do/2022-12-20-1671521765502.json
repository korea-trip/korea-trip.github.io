It was named so because the leaves turn so crimson that the water of the valley reflects the color and appears crimson as well. This is the place where Chi-Won Choe, after returning from Dang China to Silla (BC 57-AD 935) found Korea in disarray. It was too much to bear for him so he retired to live privately with poetry until his death. <br><br>There are 19 famous places in Hongryudonggyegok Valley, including major cultural assets like Jongsangjeong Pavilion, Nakhwadam, and Bunokpok. The scenery of Nongsanjeong Pavilion, where Chi-Won Choe read poetry and played baduk, is especially beautiful.  On the opposite side is a rock where you can see the handwring of Chi-Won Choe. The Yongmunpokpo Falls, located on the north end of the valley, has beautiful scenery with its harmonious blend of falling water and Giamgoiseok (fantastic rocks and stones).  <br><br>The scenery of Hongryudonggyegok Valley changes every season, and it is the finest part of Gayasan Mountain. It is famous for the azaleas in full bloom during the spring, and for the thousand-year-old pine trees and broad-leaved trees growing thickly throughout the valley and the cool, clear water that runs through it during the summer. In the fall, the nearby pine tree forests and broad-leaved trees tinge in color and accentuate the crimson foliage of autumnal leaves, making the crimson reflection of the leaves in the valley water look like a rising flame, and shows why the valley was named Hongryudonggyegok Valley.","regDate":"2022-12-28","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Valleys"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-28-1672212935139/2625847_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-28-1672212935139"},{"id":"2022-12-28-1672209537187","title":"Hapcheon Okgyeseowon Confucian Academy (Ïò•Í≥ÑÏÑúÏõê(Ìï©Ï≤ú))","description":"Hapcheon Okgyeseowon Confucian Academy was built to store Yulgok Yi Is writings, Gyeokmongyogyeol and Haedongyeonwonnok.

Researchers believe that these enormous footprints belong to a species of huge pterosaur, and visitors can see about 60 smaller footprints that are believed to belong to early humans. The dinosaur footprints and other cretaceous fossils are located along the cape by the shore, so you must time your visit well to see them. According to paleontologists, the footprints are the evidence of three specimens of herbivorous  sauropoda, which walked on two 60 centimeter-long feet; two specimens of ornithopoda, which were also herbivores, that had three toes on each foot; and one specimen of another ornithopod species, a carnivore that had sharp claws and walked on two feet. The layout of the footprints alludes to a situation where the herbivores were walking in a group followed by a carnivore preparing for an attack! <br><br>","regDate":"2022-12-27","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Eco-Tourism Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-27-1672133762383/212944_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-27-1672133762383"},{"id":"2022-12-27-1672130246490","title":"DPIRANG (ÎîîÌîºÎûë)","description":"DPIRANG is a digital nighttime theme park in Nammangsan Park that consists of 15 walking paths decorated with lights.
