Photos of the family on vacation there show Kim Jungil as a young boy of six years. The building was constructed entirely of stone in 1938 by a German architect for the Sherwood Hall missionary family, and features a basement level and two above-ground floors. The house is now open to the public, with an exhibition of how the house was used by the Kim family, faithfully recreated from photographic research.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>• For more info: +82-33-680-3677|\n|opendate:|July 1999|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Summer 09:00-18:00 <br>Winter 09:00-17:30<br>* Last ticketing 1 hr before closing|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|[Hwajinpo History & Security Museum] <br />Individuals: Adults 3,000 won / Teenagers & Children 2,300 won <br />Groups: Adults 2,300 won / Teenagers & Children 1,600 won <br /><br>* Group: 30 people or more<br />* Admission includes Villa of Rhee Syngman, Villa of Lee Ki-poong, Castle of Hwajinpo & Ecology Museum <br />* Free admission: senior citizens (ages 65 and older)|\n|Restrooms:|Available at parking lot|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Available - English, Japanese, Chinese<br>* Advance reservation required at Hwajinpo Tourist Information Center|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-24-1658677155313/2600598_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658677155313/2600598_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658677155313/2600599_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658677155313/2600599_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658677155313/2600600_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658677155313/2600600_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658677155313/571638_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658677155313/571638_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658677155313/571640_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658677155313/571640_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658677155313/571641_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658677155313/571641_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-33-680-3677](tel:+82336803677)\n- [🏠www.gwgs.go.kr](https://www.gwgs.go.kr/tour/index.do)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 38.4725399459\nlongitude: 128.4431686945\ntitle: 280, Hwajinpo-gil, Goseong-gun, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus + Taxi]<br>\nFrom Dong Seoul Bus Terminal, take a bus to Ganseong Intercity Bus Terminal.<br>From Ganseong Bus Terminal, take a taxi for approx. 15 min.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-24-1658677155313","title":"Castle at Hwajinpo (화진포의 성(김일성별장))","description":"The Castle of Hwajinpo was the summer retreat for Kim Ilsung, former leader of North Korea, and his family from 1948 to 1950.

As the mountain (san) comprises three rocky peaks (samak), which are Yonghwabong (main peak, 654 m), Cheongunbong (546 m), and Deungseonbong (632 m), it was named Samaksan Mountain. Although it is not a high and majestic mountain, it is considered a mountain with splendid scenery. Samaksan Mountain embraces a fantastic gorge formed through quartzitic jointing and waterfalls. Waterfalls in different sizes, such as Deungseon Falls, Seunghak Falls, and Juryeom Falls, create the splendid landscape, and the top of the mountain commands a panoramic view of downtown Chuncheon along with Uiamho Lake and the Bukhangang River. As its name tells, Samaksan Mountain is known for its rugged and precipitous features (aksan meaning a rugged, rocky mountain). The main access road to the mountain starts from the Deungseon Falls’ ticket booth and the Uiam Ticket Booth, and the trail from Uiam covers a hard, rocky section. As Gangwon-do Monument No. 16, Samaksan Mountain also has various interesting attractions, including Sangwonsa Temple, Heungguksa Temple, and Samaksanseong Fortress.","regDate":"2022-10-09","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-09-1665298551313/1842025_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-09-1665298551313"},{"id":"2022-10-09-1665295006748","title":"Sacheon Beach (사천해변(사천해수욕장))","description":"Nestled between Gyeongpodae Beach and Yeongok Beach, Sacheon Beach is a clean and quiet beach covering an area of 18,000 ㎡ over a length of 300 meters.
