Although it is not a high and majestic mountain, it is considered a mountain with splendid scenery. Samaksan Mountain embraces a fantastic gorge formed through quartzitic jointing and waterfalls. Waterfalls in different sizes, such as Deungseon Falls, Seunghak Falls, and Juryeom Falls, create the splendid landscape, and the top of the mountain commands a panoramic view of downtown Chuncheon along with Uiamho Lake and the Bukhangang River. As its name tells, Samaksan Mountain is known for its rugged and precipitous features (aksan meaning a rugged, rocky mountain). The main access road to the mountain starts from the Deungseon Falls’ ticket booth and the Uiam Ticket Booth, and the trail from Uiam covers a hard, rocky section. As Gangwon-do Monument No. 16, Samaksan Mountain also has various interesting attractions, including Sangwonsa Temple, Heungguksa Temple, and Samaksanseong Fortress.","regDate":"2022-10-09","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-09-1665298551313/1842025_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-09-1665298551313"},{"id":"2022-10-09-1665295006748","title":"Sacheon Beach (사천해변(사천해수욕장))","description":"Nestled between Gyeongpodae Beach and Yeongok Beach, Sacheon Beach is a clean and quiet beach covering an area of 18,000 ㎡ over a length of 300 meters.
