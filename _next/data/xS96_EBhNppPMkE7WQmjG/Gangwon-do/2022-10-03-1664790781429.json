Sitting on the edge of a cliff overlooking Osipcheon Stream, the pavilion incorporates the rocks on the cliff as cornerstones, with a five-girder paljak (ancient-style roof).<br><br>Then, there are 26 signboards hanging from the rafters of the pavilion. The signboards contain inscriptions of&nbsp;famous ancient scholars such as Jeilgyeongjeong (The best riverside pavilion; 1662) by Heo Mok, Jukseoru and Gwandong Jeilru (The best pavilion in Gwandong; 1711) by Yi Seong-jo, and Haeseon Yuhui Jiso (The place that marine gods enjoy; 1837) by Yi Gyu-heon. Others who have left their mark include King Sukjong (1674-1720), King Jeongjo (1776-1800) and Yulgok YiYi (1536-1584). Evidently, Jukseoru Pavilion has served as an inspiration since its establishment, and continues to inspire visitors today through the stunning view of its surrounding nature.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-33-570-3670|\n|parking:|Available|\n|usetime:|March-October: 09:00-18:00<br>November-February: 09:00-17:00 <br>* Last admission: 30min before closing.|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Film Locations:|Movie \"April Snow (2005)\"|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Available Facilities:|Walking trail, stone posts, etc.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Unavailable|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-10-03-1664790781429/1425802_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-03-1664790781429/1425802_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-03-1664790781429/1425804_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-03-1664790781429/1425804_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-03-1664790781429/1425823_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-03-1664790781429/1425823_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-03-1664790781429/1425825_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-03-1664790781429/1425825_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-03-1664790781429/2032652_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-03-1664790781429/2032652_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-03-1664790781429/2494692_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-03-1664790781429/2494692_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-03-1664790781429/2654472_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-03-1664790781429/2654472_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-03-1664790781429/2654474_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-03-1664790781429/2654474_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-03-1664790781429/2654475_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-03-1664790781429/2654475_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-03-1664790781429/1425785_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-03-1664790781429/1425785_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-33-570-3670](tel:+82335703670)\n- [üè†www.samcheok.go.kr</a> (Korean, English, Chinese, Japanese) <br><a href=\"http://www.cha.go.kr/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"web\">www.cha.go.kr]( http://www.samcheok.go.kr/tour.web)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.4408708123\nlongitude: 129.1604665182\ntitle: 37, Jukseoru-gil, Samcheok-si, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Seoul Express Terminal, take a bus to Samcheok Bus Terminal. <br>\nFrom Samcheok Bus Terminal, walk for approx. 10-15 min. to Jukseoru Pavilion.\n","data":{"id":"2022-10-03-1664790781429","title":"Jukseoru Pavilion (ÏÇºÏ≤ô Ï£ΩÏÑúÎ£®)","description":"Jukseoru Pavilion, estimated to have been built around 1266, is one of the eight major attractions of Gwandong District in middle eastern Korea collectively known as Gwandong Palgyeong (eight famous sites).

Although it is not a high and majestic mountain, it is considered a mountain with splendid scenery. Samaksan Mountain embraces a fantastic gorge formed through quartzitic jointing and waterfalls. Waterfalls in different sizes, such as Deungseon Falls, Seunghak Falls, and Juryeom Falls, create the splendid landscape, and the top of the mountain commands a panoramic view of downtown Chuncheon along with Uiamho Lake and the Bukhangang River. As its name tells, Samaksan Mountain is known for its rugged and precipitous features (aksan meaning a rugged, rocky mountain). The main access road to the mountain starts from the Deungseon Falls‚Äô ticket booth and the Uiam Ticket Booth, and the trail from Uiam covers a hard, rocky section. As Gangwon-do Monument No. 16, Samaksan Mountain also has various interesting attractions, including Sangwonsa Temple, Heungguksa Temple, and Samaksanseong Fortress.","regDate":"2022-10-09","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-09-1665298551313/1842025_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-09-1665298551313"},{"id":"2022-10-09-1665295006748","title":"Sacheon Beach (ÏÇ¨Ï≤úÌï¥Î≥Ä(ÏÇ¨Ï≤úÌï¥ÏàòÏöïÏû•))","description":"Nestled between Gyeongpodae Beach and Yeongok Beach, Sacheon Beach is a clean and quiet beach covering an area of 18,000 „é° over a length of 300 meters.
