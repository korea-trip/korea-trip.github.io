The beautifully formed rock towers high into the sky and resembles a candlestick, from which it gets its name. Chotdaebawi Rock and the nearby rock formations seem to change the shape they resemble along with the waves that crash against the rocks. The view of the sunrise from behind Chotdaebawi Rock is so popular that it attracts photographers and tourists nationwide.\n<br><br>\n* The Legend of Chotdaebawi Rock<br>\nOnce upon a time, there was a man who lived in Chuam who had a concubine. His wife was jealous of the second wife and the conflict between the two women continually escalated. One day, god became enraged over their continual quarreling and threw lighting down from heaven, striking both women dead. The newly-made widower missed his wives so much that he remained frozen in his loneliness and eventually turned into a rock, which is now called Chotdaebawi Rock.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|expagerange:|Open to visitors of all ages|\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-33-530-2801|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Open 24 hr|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Available Facilities:|Restaurants, accommodations, etc.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-25-1658748901695/2363917_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658748901695/2363917_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658748901695/2363918_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658748901695/2363918_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658748901695/2363919_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658748901695/2363919_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658748901695/2363920_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658748901695/2363920_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658748901695/2653696_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658748901695/2653696_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658748901695/2653698_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658748901695/2653698_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658748901695/2653701_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658748901695/2653701_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658748901695/2653703_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658748901695/2653703_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658748901695/2716605_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658748901695/2716605_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658748901695/2716606_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658748901695/2716606_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-33-530-2801](tel:+82335302801)\n- [🏠www.dh.go.kr/tour](http://www.dh.go.kr/tour/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.4790136061\nlongitude: 129.1586182867\ntitle: 17-1, Chotdaebawi-gil, Donghae-si, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-25-1658748901695","title":"Chuam Chotdaebawi Rock (추암 촛대바위)","description":"Chuam Chotdaebawi Rock in Donghae-si, Gangwon-do is one of Korea’s most famous tourist attractions.

Although it is not a high and majestic mountain, it is considered a mountain with splendid scenery. Samaksan Mountain embraces a fantastic gorge formed through quartzitic jointing and waterfalls. Waterfalls in different sizes, such as Deungseon Falls, Seunghak Falls, and Juryeom Falls, create the splendid landscape, and the top of the mountain commands a panoramic view of downtown Chuncheon along with Uiamho Lake and the Bukhangang River. As its name tells, Samaksan Mountain is known for its rugged and precipitous features (aksan meaning a rugged, rocky mountain). The main access road to the mountain starts from the Deungseon Falls’ ticket booth and the Uiam Ticket Booth, and the trail from Uiam covers a hard, rocky section. As Gangwon-do Monument No. 16, Samaksan Mountain also has various interesting attractions, including Sangwonsa Temple, Heungguksa Temple, and Samaksanseong Fortress.","regDate":"2022-10-09","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-09-1665298551313/1842025_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-09-1665298551313"},{"id":"2022-10-09-1665295006748","title":"Sacheon Beach (사천해변(사천해수욕장))","description":"Nestled between Gyeongpodae Beach and Yeongok Beach, Sacheon Beach is a clean and quiet beach covering an area of 18,000 ㎡ over a length of 300 meters.
