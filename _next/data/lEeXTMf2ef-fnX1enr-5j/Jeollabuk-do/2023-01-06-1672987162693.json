The temple was established because of the theory of divination, based on topology. The belief held that Korea’s good spirit would be taken away to Japan, bringing bad luck if the temple was not constructed at this particular location. The temple was reconstructed in the 26th year of King Sukjong’s reign (1700) after it was completely destroyed during the Imjin War (1592-1598). However, it was almost burnt down in the 19th year of King Gojong’s reign (1882).<br> <br>It is presently preserved just as it was during the Unified Silla Kingdom, with its three-story pagoda and its 11 treasures with a total of 17 cultural assets. The entrance of the temple lies in the middle of a rice field and the temple has a pastoral view, surrounded by trees. From the entrance, visitors can cross the half-moon shaped stone bridge to find a remarkable totem pole.","regDate":"2023-01-07","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-07-1673084146360/1604040_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-07-1673084146360"},{"id":"2023-01-07-1673080623612","title":"Namwon Recreational Forest (남원자연휴양림)","description":"Namwon Recreational Forest is located at the base of Cheonhwangsan Mountain.
