The plantation is an eco-tourism destination that aims to contribute in reducing carbon dioxide and improve the local economy through green tea production. Despite the large field that covers an area of approx. 264,400 ㎡, Dosun Dawon Tea Plantation is not very well known among tourists. However, the plantation is frequented by photographers who visit to take snapshots of the vast field against the backdrop of Hallasan Mountain or Jeju's beautiful ocean.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-64-739-0419|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-19-1658252731994/2617707_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658252731994/2617707_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658252731994/2617709_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658252731994/2617709_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658252731994/2617710_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658252731994/2617710_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658252731994/2617711_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658252731994/2617711_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-64-739-0419](tel:+82647390419)\n- [🏠www.visitjeju.net](https://www.visitjeju.net/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.2724187254\nlongitude: 126.4829234611\ntitle: 152-41, Jungsanganseo-ro 356beon-gil, Seogwipo-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Taxi]<br>\nApprox. 15 min from Seogwipo Bus Terminal\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-19-1658252731994","title":"Dosun Dawon Tea Plantation (도순다원)","description":"Dosun Dawon Tea Plantation is Korea's first tea plantation to build and operate a modern tea-manufacturing factory.

It has been featured in films, and was originally used for agriculture, but has now been given over to a field of silver grass. From the summit, visitors can see Udo Island, as well as take in the magnificent sunrise.

The exquisite landscape makes it one of the most beautiful places to dive as well. Going deep into the 40 meter sea-bed, visitors can see countless fish, rare iridescent coral reefs, and a surreal-looking shipwreck with schools of fish surrounding it.

The park is easily accessible by car, thanks to the paved road from the mountain’s foothills all the way up to the park’s entrance. It takes about 30 minutes by car from Seogwipo’s downtown to the recreational park. The park is densely packed with trees and the air is filled with the refreshing forest scent, and even has a pebble walking trail suitable for a barefoot massage. The forest is equipped with amenities such as a mountain cottage, forest bathing site, campfire site, cooking area, and auto-camping site. Although the amenities serve to provide visitors’ convenience, they are minimized so as to prevent damage to the forest’s natural environment.","regDate":"2023-02-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Recreational Forests"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-12-1676176737273/1207811_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-12-1676176737273"},{"id":"2023-02-12-1676173046682","title":"Seogwipo New Paradise Cruise (서귀포유람선 뉴파라다이스호)","description":"Seogwipo New Paradise Cruise offers dazzling scenery on the coastal lines and islands around Seogwipo Port in Jeju.
