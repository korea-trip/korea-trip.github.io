It has been featured in films, and was originally used for agriculture, but has now been given over to a field of silver grass. From the summit, visitors can see Udo Island, as well as take in the magnificent sunrise.

Seogwipo Submarine offers safe undersea tours in its recently acquired state of the art submarine from Finland. Munseom, where the submarine travels, is home to outstanding coral reefs, colorful schools of fish, and rich seaweed. The exquisite landscape makes it one of the most beautiful places to dive as well. Going deep into the 40 meter sea-bed, visitors can see countless fish, rare iridescent coral reefs, and a surreal-looking shipwreck with schools of fish surrounding it. Over 20 years of technical knowhow and safe operation (in fact, the longest submarine tour without a single accident on record) make Seogwipo Submarine a must-see attraction on Jeju Island.","regDate":"2023-02-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Cruises/Submarines"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-12-1676180133673/1618776_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-12-1676180133673"},{"id":"2023-02-12-1676176737273","title":"Seogwipo Recreational Forest (서귀포자연휴양림)","description":"Seogwipo Recreational Forest is Korea’s southernmost recreational park that serves as an excellent nature getaway by preserving the mountain’s forest environment and ecosystem while minimalizing manmade structures as much as possible.

The park is easily accessible by car, thanks to the paved road from the mountain’s foothills all the way up to the park’s entrance. It takes about 30 minutes by car from Seogwipo’s downtown to the recreational park. The park is densely packed with trees and the air is filled with the refreshing forest scent, and even has a pebble walking trail suitable for a barefoot massage. The forest is equipped with amenities such as a mountain cottage, forest bathing site, campfire site, cooking area, and auto-camping site. Although the amenities serve to provide visitors’ convenience, they are minimized so as to prevent damage to the forest’s natural environment.","regDate":"2023-02-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Recreational Forests"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-12-1676176737273/1207811_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-12-1676176737273"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
