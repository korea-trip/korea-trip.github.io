Jeju has a year-round average temerature of 16℃ and nutrient-rich soil with plenty of water for the tea plants to grow well. The two cave cafes, Evergreen Luce Garden and Eve Hall, serve naturally fermented green tea bread, cookies, muffins, green tea latte and green tea juice. <br><br>\n\nEvergreen Luce outdoor garden was built inside a cave formed naturally by a volcanic eruption. Despite being in a cave, this outdoor garden has ponds, bridges, indigenous trees and flowers. Eve Hall is located through a hole in the cave ceiling and can be only reached after passing through a tunnel-like cave. The deepest part of Eve Hall is roughly 30 meters and is home to bats; if you are lucky, you might even see a few.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-64-782-0005,<br> +82-64-784-9030|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|* Varies by season; please make an inquiry in advance.|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|* Varies by season; please make an inquiry in advance.|\n|Available Facilities:|Tea culture center, Daheeyeon restaurant, Gotjawal Cave, Cave Cafe, green tea field, Bille Pond, zipline, etc. |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Reservation Info. for Natives:|Advanced reservation required for experience programs.|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620105_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620105_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620106_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620106_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620107_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620107_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620109_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620109_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620110_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620110_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620111_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620111_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620112_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620112_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620113_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620113_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620114_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620114_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620115_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620115_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-64-782-0005](tel:+82647820005)\n- [🏠www.daheeyeon.com](http://www.daheeyeon.com/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.4871596654\nlongitude: 126.7061797858\ntitle: 117, Seongyo-ro, Jeju-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Local Bus]<br>\nFrom Jeju International Airport, take Bus No. 38 and get off at Jocheon-eup Gwannae/Seonin-dong Bus Stop.<br>\nTransfer to Bus No. 900 and get off at Gyeongdeokwon Bus Stop.<br><br>\n\n[Taxi]<br>\nApprox. 40 min from Jeju International Airport.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-19-1658241314969","title":"Daheeyeon Garden (다희연)","description":"Daheeyeon Garden is a major tea farm on Jeju Island, which has the best conditions for growing great tea in a natural environment.
