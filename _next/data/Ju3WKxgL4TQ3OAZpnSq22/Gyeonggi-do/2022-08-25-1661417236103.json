The king and queen are enshrined separately. The tomb on the left is King Sejo‚Äôs and the one on the right is Queen Jeonhui‚Äôs with a pavilion standing between the two tombs.

This area is a key wintering site for various migratory birds such as white-naped cranes, and hooded cranes, with up to 200 birds spending every winter in the area. Given the unique characteristics created by the geographical condition of the area near the border between South and North Korea and the natural environment of the Imjingang River, the site is a great natural ecological habitat for various wildlife. <br><br>The Gunnam Flood Control Theme Park features ‚ÄúThe Story of Peace and Love told by Cranes‚Äù as its theme. Various story-telling facilities are installed, such as the drum of peace, a wishing tree, and crane structures.
