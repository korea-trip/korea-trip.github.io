Over the years, the street  gained a reputation for serving delicious haemultang (seafood stew), and there are now ten seafood restaurants on the street. Each restaurant offers a rich, yet distinctly different flavored seafood stew prepared with aromatic vegetables and fresh seafood purchased from the marketplace every morning. The Haemultang Street has become so popular that many people travel the long distance from Seoul just for a satisfying meal of seafood stew. The restaurants specialize in stew and steamed seafood dishes, but also continue to develop new fusion menus to please all taste buds.","regDate":"2022-07-11","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Culture/Art/History","Experience Programs","Cultural Districts"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-11-1657550531663/740109_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-07-11-1657550531663"},{"id":"2022-07-11-1657543591392","title":"Baedari Secondhand Bookstore Alley (Î∞∞Îã§Î¶¨ ÌóåÏ±ÖÎ∞© Í≥®Î™©)","description":"Baedari Secondhand Bookstore Alley is located in the boundary between Geumgok-dong and Changyeong-dong in Dong-gu, Incheon. Prior to the establishment of Gyeongin Railroad, this alley was Incheon‚Äôs representative road to Seoul, referred to as Ugakli Street. During the 60s and 70s when living was difficult and everything was hard to get one's hands on, it was the only secondhand bookstore alley in the Incheon area where people could quench their thirst for learning. Known as the Baedari Bookstore Alley, there are about 10 bookstores altogether within the area that sell secondhand books and new books. Countless books in a wide range of topics from ancient Korean literature, arts, music, medicine, children‚Äôs books, dictionaries and more fill up the small but charming bookstores. Artworks that depict the old lifestyles of residents at Baedari decorate the alley walls, offering more to see.","regDate":"2022-07-11","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Culture/Art/History","Experience Programs","Cultural Districts"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-11-1657543591392/2030736_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-07-11-1657543591392","pageUrl":"https:/korea-trip.github.io/Incheon/2022-07-11-1657543591392"}],"navList":["Incheon","Seoul"]},"__N_SSG":true}
