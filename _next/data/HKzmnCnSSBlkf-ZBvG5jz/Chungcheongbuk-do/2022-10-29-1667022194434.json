The legend of Okdap says that an old enchantress who lived in heaven once came to the earth to get water and then dropped her <em>binyeo</em> (traditional Korean hairpin) near Seongmun. As she searched for her binyeo, she was extremely impressed by the beautiful views. Mesmerized, she&nbsp;left heaven and lived near Seongmun as an ordinary peasant, growing crops and expanding farmlands.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-43-422-1146|\n|parking:|Available|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Parking Fees:|[On-day parking]<br>Sedans 2,000 won<br>Buses 4,000 won<br><br>[Overnight parking]<br>Sedans 4,000 won<br>Buses 8,000|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Available Facilities:|Music fountain, Dodamsambong cruise, etc.|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Guide in English, Japanese, & Chinese available from Danyang Tourist Center.|\n|Korean Info.
