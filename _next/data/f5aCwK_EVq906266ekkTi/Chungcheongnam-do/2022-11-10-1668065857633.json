Furthermore, it is where four generations of ancestors such as his great-grandfather Kim Jin-hu (martyred in 1814), great uncle Kim Han-hyun (1816), father Kim Jae-jun (1839), and priest Kim Dae-gun himself (martyred in 1846) lived.<br><br> He was chosen as a theological student in Golmaemashil and studied in Macao. In 1846, he was ordained as priest by Bishop Ferr√©ol in Shanghai, Kim Ga Hang Cathedral. After his return to Korea, he worked in Yongin until September 1846 when he was tried, executed and died a martyr when he was only 26. Pope Johannes Paulus II appointed him a saint during his visit to Korea in May 1984. In Solmoe, Priest Kim Dae-gun‚Äôs statue and a memorial stands underneath the pine trees and his remains are placed inside the nearby cathedral.","regDate":"2022-11-15","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Holy Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-15-1668484699356/2635127_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Chungcheongnam-do/2022-11-15-1668484699356"},{"id":"2022-11-14-1668422705382","title":"Sinseong-ri Reed Field (Ïã†ÏÑ±Î¶¨ Í∞àÎåÄÎ∞≠)","description":"As one of Korea‚Äôs top four fields of reeds, Sinseong-ri Reed Field (nearly 60,000 pyeong) has also been popularized as a filming location of the mega-hit Korean movie, ‚ÄúJSA.‚Äù<br><br>To protect the natural environment, only 2-3% of the entire area of field of reed has been developed into a park.
