The beach has a length of 1.5 kilometers and x_width of 50 meters. The water level is 1-2 meters and the water temperature is approximately 22 degrees Celsius. The surrounding pine forest is lush and beautiful. In particular, there is a fishing spot with a large rock formation in front of the beach. For one to two days each month, there is a phenomenon also know as Moses Miracle that opens a 1.5-kilometer-long road in the sea. This mysterious sea road was thought to only appear during summer, however it was revealed that it actually occurs every lunar month. In 1996, the beach was open to the general public. <br><br> The red lighthouse towering at the end of the long breakwater is as impressive as a picture. The pretty pensions right in front of the sandy beach add to the scenery. Also, Daecheonhang Port is a 20 minutes drive away, and there visitors can enjoy fresh seafood and grilled shellfish at an affordable price.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-41-936-3561|\n|parking:|Available|\n|usetime:|09:00-22:00 (swimming hours 09:00-19:00)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Shower booth, changing room, camping site, drinking fountain, auto camping site (operated by the city)|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-10-1668062832249/1598840_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-10-1668062832249/1598840_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-10-1668062832249/1598841_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-10-1668062832249/1598841_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-10-1668062832249/1598842_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-10-1668062832249/1598842_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-10-1668062832249/1598846_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-10-1668062832249/1598846_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-10-1668062832249/1830273_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-10-1668062832249/1830273_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-10-1668062832249/2022148_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-10-1668062832249/2022148_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-10-1668062832249/2023721_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-10-1668062832249/2023721_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-10-1668062832249/2023736_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-10-1668062832249/2023736_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-10-1668062832249/1598843_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-10-1668062832249/1598843_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-10-1668062832249/1598845_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-10-1668062832249/1598845_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-41-936-3561](tel:+82419363561)\n- [üè†www.moochangpo.com](http://www.moochangpo.com/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.2445351993\nlongitude: 126.5365469039\ntitle: 10, Yeollinbada 1-gil, Boryeong-si, Chungcheongnam-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-10-1668062832249","title":"Muchangpo Beach (Î¨¥Ï∞ΩÌè¨Ìï¥ÏàòÏöïÏû•)","description":"Muchangpo Beach was a military site during the Joseon dynasty and was the first beach to open on the west coast in 1928.
