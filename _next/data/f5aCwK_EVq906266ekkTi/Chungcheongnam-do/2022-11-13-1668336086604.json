The trails are as easy and suitable for all hikers including the elderly and young hikers. A distant view of the west sea is even visible from the top of the mountain. Gayasan Mountain offers amazing scenery all year round, most notably in spring when azaleas, royal azaleas, and an array of wildflowers are in full bloom.<br /><br />The mountain also contains the Seosan Rock-carved Buddha Triad (National Treasure), which is considered the best rock-carved Buddha from the Baekje period.
