The temple is widely believed to have been first built during the Tamra dynasty (BC 476~AD 1005), which was prior to the Goryeo dynasty (AD 918~1392). However, there is no concrete evidence suggesting the exact year of construction or the temple’s original builder. In the early 1700s, when leaders of the Joseon dynasty proclaimed Confucianism as the national religion and executed a policy to destroy all the Buddhist temples in the Jeju area, where Gwaneumsa Temple was demolished. It was rebuilt in 1912 by a Buddhist nun, Anbongryeokwan, and renovated in 1964. <br><br>\n\nThe temple consists of the main shrine, Myeongbujeong Hall, a bell tower, Sanshingak Pavilion, and Bulimun Gate. There is also a Buddhist school run by the Gwaneumsa Temple located in downtown Jeju.<br><br>\n\nThere are many tourist spots near the temple such as a wooden seated Buddhist goddess statue that was designated a tangible cultural asset of Jeju-do in 1999. Other popular destinations include Jeju Natural Monument No. 50, a cherry blossom tree habitat, and the nearby “4.3 Historic Site” commemorating the civil revolution many years ago on April 3rd.<br><br>\n\nAlso located close to the temple are the Mokseokwan Arboretum, Sancheondan, Halla Mountain, Uerimok Valley, Tamra Valley, and Gewaloreum Hill.

When the Goryeo dynasty made peace with the Mongolian forces in February 1270 (the 11th year of King Wonjong), the Sambyeolcho special defense unit opposed it and launched a resistance movement. They moved their base to Jindo in Jeollanam-do, but after suffering a huge defeat, they moved to Jeju-do and built Hangpaduseong Fortress. They continued to fight against the Mongolian forces for two more years there. However, all the members were killed in April 1273 (the 14th year of King Wonjong).<br> <br>This independent anti-Mongolian movement was born out the deeply patriotic belief in the need to safeguard the nation from foreign invasion. In 1977, the government invested 745 million won to restore part of the fortress and build a monument in commemoration of those who died in the war. The work was completed in June 1978.","regDate":"2023-02-07","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-07-1675755361292/1618314_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-07-1675755361292"},{"id":"2023-02-07-1675751929383","title":"Hallasan Mountain [National Geopark] (한라산 (제주도 국가지질공원))","description":"Hallasan Mountain stands proudly at the center of Jeju Island and is perhaps the island’s most memorable landmark.
