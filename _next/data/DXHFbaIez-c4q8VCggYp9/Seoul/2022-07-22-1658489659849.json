Before the restaurants, people working at the shopping complex lived along the alley and would prepare <em>dak kalguksu</em> (chicken noodle soup). Over time and as the economy improved, this dish became quite normal while the focus shifted from the noodles to the chicken itself. Now, visitors can enjoy this local dish in the place where it all started.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>• For more info: +82-2-2236-9135|\n|parking:|Not available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-22-1658489659849/2601452_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-22-1658489659849/2601452_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-22-1658489659849/2601454_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-22-1658489659849/2601454_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-22-1658489659849/2601455_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-22-1658489659849/2601455_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-22-1658489659849/2601456_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-22-1658489659849/2601456_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-2-2236-9135](tel:+82222369135)\n- [🏠tour.jongno.go.kr](http://tour.jongno.go.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5703487391\nlongitude: 127.0058684191\ntitle: 14, Jong-ro 40ga-gil, Jongno-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-22-1658489659849","title":"Dongdaemun Dak Hanmari Alley (서울 동대문 닭한마리 골목)","description":"Dongdaemun Dak Hanmari Alley is located near Dongdaemun Shopping Complex and the many restaurants here have been in operation anywhere from five to thirty years.
