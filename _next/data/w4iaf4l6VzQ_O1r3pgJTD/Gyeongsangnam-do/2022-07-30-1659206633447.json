The nearly 12-kilometer-long Daewonsagyegok Valley's stream water originates from the highest peak of Jirisan Mountain called Cheonwangbong Peak, and flows through Jungbong and Habong Peaks, as well as Ssukbatjae Pass, Saejae Pass, Wangdeungjae Pass, Bammeorijae Pass, and Ungseokbong Peak.  Before reaching the valley, the water joins the currents from Sinbatgol, Jogaegol, and Bambatgol Valleys. The volume of water increases as it passes Saejae and Oegok Village and reaches Yupyeong-ri where Daewonsa Temple is located. The incessant sound of running water fills the silence of the forest as if Buddhist nuns were chanting blessings.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|expagerange:|Open to visitors of all ages|\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-55-970-7201~5|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-30-1659206633447/2671384_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659206633447/2671384_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659206633447/2671385_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659206633447/2671385_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659206633447/2671387_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659206633447/2671387_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659206633447/2671388_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659206633447/2671388_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659206633447/2671389_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659206633447/2671389_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659206633447/2671390_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659206633447/2671390_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659206633447/2671391_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659206633447/2671391_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659206633447/2671392_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659206633447/2671392_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659206633447/2671393_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659206633447/2671393_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659206633447/2671394_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659206633447/2671394_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-55-970-7201](tel:+82559707201)\n- [üè†jiri.knps.or.kr</a><br/><a href=\"http://www.sancheong.go.kr/tour/index.do\" target=\"_blank\">www.sancheong.go.kr](http://jiri.knps.or.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.3563249828\nlongitude: 127.8101068526\ntitle: Samjang-myeon, Sancheong-gun, Gyeongsangnam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Express/Intercity Bus]<br>\nTake a bus from Seoul Nambu Terminal or Dong Seoul Bus Terminal to Sancheong Intercity Bus Terminal.<br><br>\n[Taxi]<br>\nApprox. 45 min from Sancheong Intercity Bus Terminal.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-30-1659206633447","title":"Daewonsagyegok Valley (ÎåÄÏõêÏÇ¨Í≥ÑÍ≥°)","description":"Daewonsagyegok Valley is a place where one can be appreciate nature's musical harmony of stream water, wind brushing against the leaves, and the chirping of birds.

It was named so because the leaves turn so crimson that the water of the valley reflects the color and appears crimson as well. This is the place where Chi-Won Choe, after returning from Dang China to Silla (BC 57-AD 935) found Korea in disarray. It was too much to bear for him so he retired to live privately with poetry until his death. <br><br>There are 19 famous places in Hongryudonggyegok Valley, including major cultural assets like Jongsangjeong Pavilion, Nakhwadam, and Bunokpok. The scenery of Nongsanjeong Pavilion, where Chi-Won Choe read poetry and played baduk, is especially beautiful.  On the opposite side is a rock where you can see the handwring of Chi-Won Choe. The Yongmunpokpo Falls, located on the north end of the valley, has beautiful scenery with its harmonious blend of falling water and Giamgoiseok (fantastic rocks and stones).  <br><br>The scenery of Hongryudonggyegok Valley changes every season, and it is the finest part of Gayasan Mountain. It is famous for the azaleas in full bloom during the spring, and for the thousand-year-old pine trees and broad-leaved trees growing thickly throughout the valley and the cool, clear water that runs through it during the summer. In the fall, the nearby pine tree forests and broad-leaved trees tinge in color and accentuate the crimson foliage of autumnal leaves, making the crimson reflection of the leaves in the valley water look like a rising flame, and shows why the valley was named Hongryudonggyegok Valley.","regDate":"2022-12-28","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Valleys"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-28-1672212935139/2625847_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-28-1672212935139"},{"id":"2022-12-28-1672209537187","title":"Hapcheon Okgyeseowon Confucian Academy (Ïò•Í≥ÑÏÑúÏõê(Ìï©Ï≤ú))","description":"Hapcheon Okgyeseowon Confucian Academy was built to store Yulgok Yi Is writings, Gyeokmongyogyeol and Haedongyeonwonnok.
