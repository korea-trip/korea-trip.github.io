Unlike his predecessors, Lee listens to the story of the ghost and finds the low-ranked officer who had killed her and punishes him.

Aranggak was also built in her memory. <br><br>\n\nEvery year, an event called Arangje is held on April 16 by the lunar calendar in Aranggak Pavilion. Young maidens dressed in white hanbok perform a religious ceremony to soothe the sorrow of Arang.

It is also dotted with seven waterfalls and 33 ponds. The hike becomes more difficult as the trail enters the valley. Because the valley has taken many lives, some people call it The Valley of Death. For that reason, visitors must apply in advance and hike with a guide. The trail in Chilseon Valley is a 9.4-kilometer course from Chuseong Village in Macheon-myeon to Cheonwangbong Peak, which does not follow the natural valley, due to the valleys steep and dangerous features. Starting from Chuseong Village, the trail passes Yongso Pond, Jujiteo Site, Chuseongmang Rock, Seonnyeotang Pond, Ongnyeotang Pond, Biseondam, Chilseonpokpo Falls, Daeryukpokpo Falls, Samcheungpokpo Falls and Mapokpo Falls, all before reaching Cheonwangbong Peak.","regDate":"2022-12-21","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Valleys"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-21-1671600968838/2617002_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-21-1671600968838"},{"id":"2022-12-21-1671597571410","title":"Jinjuseong Fortress (ÏßÑÏ£ºÏÑ±)","description":"Jinjuseong Fortress, which is historically linked to the Imjin War (1592-1598), was originally named Geoyeolseong Fortress during the Three Kingdom Period, later renamed as Chokseokseong Fortress in the Goryeo dynasty and finally settled as Jinjuseong Fortress in the Joseon dynasty.
