Due to its tough topography, Hansingyegok Valley has been less visited and thus still has rather untouched forests. Only hikers with stamina can trail the course from Baengmu-dong to Hansingyegok Valley to Seseok.

It is also dotted with seven waterfalls and 33 ponds. The hike becomes more difficult as the trail enters the valley. Because the valley has taken many lives, some people call it The Valley of Death. For that reason, visitors must apply in advance and hike with a guide. The trail in Chilseon Valley is a 9.4-kilometer course from Chuseong Village in Macheon-myeon to Cheonwangbong Peak, which does not follow the natural valley, due to the valleys steep and dangerous features.
