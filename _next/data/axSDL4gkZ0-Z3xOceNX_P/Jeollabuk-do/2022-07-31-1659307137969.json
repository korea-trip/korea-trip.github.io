The origin of the name \"Gaeam\" goes back to 282 BC, when King Mun from the Byeonhan confederacy took refuge here during the revolt of the Jinhan and Mahan confederacies. Under King Mun's command, temples for the new fortress were built on east and west sides of the valley; the western temple was called Gaeam. In 676, the temple was expanded and in 1276, thirty more buildings were raised, expanding it to a grand temple.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|accomcount:|No limit|\n|expagerange:|Open to visitors age 5 & over|\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<BR> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>• For more info: +82-63-581-0080|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604186_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604186_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604187_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604187_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604188_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604188_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604189_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604189_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604190_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604190_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604191_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604191_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604192_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604192_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604306_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604306_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604307_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604307_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604308_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604308_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-63-581-0080](tel:+82635810080)\n- [🏠www.gaeamsa.org</a><br /><a href=\"http://gaeamsa.templestay.com\" target=\"_blank\">gaeamsa.templestay.com](http://www.gaeamsa.org)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.6628507594\nlongitude: 126.6498267208\ntitle: 248, Gaeam-ro, Buan-gun, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-31-1659307137969","title":"Gaeamsa Temple (개암사)","description":"Gaeamsa Temple is a small, quiet temple built in 634 during the Baekje dynasty.

According to Samgukyusa (historical records published in 1281), King Mu (30th king of Baekje, in power AD 600-641) and his wife Queen Seonhwa were said to have seen a vision of Mireuksamjon (the three Sanskrit) emerging from a large pond. At the time of their revelation, the king and queen were on their way to visit a Buddhist monk in Sajasa Temple on Yonghwasan Mountain (now known as Mireuksan Mountain). In response to their vision, the king drained the nearby pond and established Mireuksa Temple. The temple is believed to have shown the most advanced architectural and cultural skills of Baekje, Silla, and Goguryeo (the three main kingdoms at that time). Records indicate that King Jinpyeong of Silla even sent his craftsmen over to assist with the temple construction. <br><br>The two main features of the Mireuksa Temple Site are the stone pagoda (Mireuksaji Seoktap) and the flagpole supports (Mireuksaji Dangganjiju). The 14.24-meter-high west stone pagoda (National Treasure No. 11) is the oldest and largest Korean stone pagoda in existence. The west pagoda currently has only six tiers, but is estimated to originally have had nine. The nine-story east stone pagoda (27.67 meters in x_height) was restored to its original stature in 1993 based on historical records. Other surviving landmarks include the flagpole supports (Treasure No. 236) to the south of the stone pagodas. The 395 centimeter-tall poles are estimated to have been created during the Unified Silla period (AD 676-935) and are set 90 meters apart from east to west.","regDate":"2023-01-06","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-06-1672983362269/2514985_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-06-1672983362269"},{"id":"2023-01-06-1672979958647","title":"Manghaesa Temple (망해사)","description":"Manghaesa Temple is located at the edge of the Gimje Plains before the sea. The temple stands at the summit of Jinbongsan Mountain.  The temple was named for the view of the ocean and the fields of rice. The temple was established by the great monk Buseol Geosa during the 2nd year of King Uija of Baekje (AD 642). Years later, Dobeopsa (a Chinese monk from the Tang dynasty) renovated the temple. The temple was altered again during the reign of King Injo of the Joseon dynasty when the great monk Jinmuk Daesa built Nakseojeon Hall in 1589. Bogwangjeon Hall and Chilseonggak Pavilion were built much later in 1933. Manghaesa Temple is unique in that it is the only temple where the distant horizon is visible over both land and sea. Nearby attractions include a walking path through a field of reeds by Mangyeonggang River and views of the sunset over the sea.","regDate":"2023-01-06","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-06-1672979958647/2675611_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-06-1672979958647"},{"id":"2023-01-06-1672976184633","title":"Maisan Hwaeomgul Cave (마이산 화엄굴)","description":"Maisan Mountain has two major peaks made of sedimentary rocks; these peaks are said to be ‘couple peaks’ and cannot be found anywhere else. Sut Maibong (alt. 667 meters) is said to be the male peak while the slightly larger Am Maibong (alt. 673 meters) is deemed the female peak. In the early Joseon period the mountain was named ‘Sokgeumsan,’ but began to be called ‘Maisan’ after the 12th year of King Taejong, who commented that the two peaks resembled horse ears (‘maisan’ meaning ‘horse ears’). All along Maisan Mountain, visitors will find small crater-like rock cavities that are formed by prolonged weathering. These unique geological features, called ‘tafoni,’ are of great academic value. <br><br>Inside Hwaeomgul Cave, visitors can observe medicinal water that flows up from underground all throughout the year. It is widely believed that once you drink the water, especially on the days of the Spring and Autumn Equinox, you will soon have a son and be blessed by the mountain spirit. Even today, many women who have difficulty conceiving visit the mountain to pray to the mountain spirits for their heart’s desire—the gift of a child. The region in which Maisan is located is the birthplace of many talented people and national heroes, which some say is proof of the blessings of the mountain and its extremely powerful spirit.","regDate":"2023-01-06","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-06-1672976184633/198644_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-06-1672976184633"},{"id":"2023-01-05-1672915064725","title":"Korea Expressway Corporation Arboretum (Jeonju Arboretum) (한국도로공사수목원(전주수목원))","description":"Korea Expressway Corporation Arboretum (Jeonju Arboretum) is located in a relatively warm region of the country, reaching 20-30 meters in altitude.
