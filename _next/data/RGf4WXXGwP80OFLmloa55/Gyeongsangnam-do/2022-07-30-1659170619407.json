It is a typical farming village, and its major produce is Jinyeong sweet persimmons and rice. Its name comes from the mound above it on Bonghwasan mountain, where in the past beacons were lit as a method of communication. Bonghwasan mountain is home to Bonghwasa temple and two famous valleys: Doduk (thief) valley on the east side, named because of the many thieves that used to operate in the area, and Yasi (fox) valley on the west side, which looks like a fox lying on its front, looking back at its tail. <Br><Br>\n\nBirthplace of the former President of Korea, Roh Moo-hyun<Br>\nThe birthplace of the former President of Korea, Roh Moo-hyun, is a brick house with a slate roof that consists of two small rooms and a kitchen. Although it is a shabby house, everything in it seems rare and precious to visitors. The earth, stones, and water, as well as household items, are popular with visitors. Some visitors even take stones and soil from the garden home with them in plastic bags, and some take water, believing that water from the ex-president‚Äôs birthplace is almost sacred.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-1688-0523, <BR> +82-55-344-1301|\n|parking:|Available|\n|usetime:|Shrine: Summer season 08:00-19:00 / Winter season 08:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-30-1659170619407/1611273_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659170619407/1611273_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659170619407/1611274_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659170619407/1611274_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659170619407/1611276_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659170619407/1611276_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659170619407/1611277_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659170619407/1611277_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659170619407/2610455_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659170619407/2610455_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-1688-0523](tel:+8216880523)\n- [üè†bongha.knowhow.or.kr</a> (Korean only)<br><a href=\"http://tour.gimhae.go.kr\" target=\"_blank\">tour.gimhae.go.kr](http://bongha.knowhow.or.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.3144525363\nlongitude: 128.7712292248\ntitle: 129, Bongha-ro, Gimhae-si, Gyeongsangnam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>From Seoul Express Bus Terminal, take a express bus to Gimhae Bus Terminal.<BR> From Gimhae Terminal Bus Stop, take Bus No.14 and get off at Jinnyeong Bus Stop.<BR>Transfer to Bus No. 57 and get off at Bonghamaeul Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-30-1659170619407","title":"Birthplace of the16th President of Korea, Roh Moo-hyun (ÏßÑÏòÅ Î¥âÌïòÎßàÏùÑÍ≥º ÎÖ∏Î¨¥ÌòÑ ÎåÄÌÜµÎ†π ÏÉùÍ∞Ä)","description":"Bongha Village is located 4.5km to the east of Jinyeong-eup, on the foot-slopes of Bonghwasan mountain.

It is also dotted with seven waterfalls and 33 ponds. The hike becomes more difficult as the trail enters the valley. Because the valley has taken many lives, some people call it The Valley of Death. For that reason, visitors must apply in advance and hike with a guide. The trail in Chilseon Valley is a 9.4-kilometer course from Chuseong Village in Macheon-myeon to Cheonwangbong Peak, which does not follow the natural valley, due to the valleys steep and dangerous features. Starting from Chuseong Village, the trail passes Yongso Pond, Jujiteo Site, Chuseongmang Rock, Seonnyeotang Pond, Ongnyeotang Pond, Biseondam, Chilseonpokpo Falls, Daeryukpokpo Falls, Samcheungpokpo Falls and Mapokpo Falls, all before reaching Cheonwangbong Peak.","regDate":"2022-12-21","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Valleys"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-21-1671600968838/2617002_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-21-1671600968838"},{"id":"2022-12-21-1671597571410","title":"Jinjuseong Fortress (ÏßÑÏ£ºÏÑ±)","description":"Jinjuseong Fortress, which is historically linked to the Imjin War (1592-1598), was originally named Geoyeolseong Fortress during the Three Kingdom Period, later renamed as Chokseokseong Fortress in the Goryeo dynasty and finally settled as Jinjuseong Fortress in the Joseon dynasty.
