The peak was originally named Gusubong (“gu” meaning “turtle,” “su” meaning “head”) after its resemblance to the head of a turtle. The flat part of the peak (the turtle’s “head”) is home to the Tomb of King Suro. On the summit is a southern-style dolmen dating back to the 4th century BC that consists of 5 or 6 support stones and a large cover stone measuring 2.5m in diameter. The cover stone bears the inscription “Gujibongseok,” said to be written by Han Ho. <br><br>Gujibong Peak is considered a sacred place by the local people because, according to legend, it is the place where the creation of the Gaya Kingdom took place. During the Japanese colonial rule, the “neck” of the turtle was destroyed by the construction of a mountain road. Years later, a pedestrian road was built to rejoin the neck and restore the feng shui of the mountain.","regDate":"2022-12-17","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-17-1671259044305/749962_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-17-1671259044305"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
