The park was renamed again in 1997 and has been known as Gyeongsanggamyeong Park ever since.\n<br><br>\nMany cultural and historical heritages are located in the park including the Seonhwa-dang building where the governor worked (Daegu Tangible Cultural Property No.1); the Jungcheong-gak building that was one of the governor’s residences (Daegu Tangible Cultural Property No.2); and Seonjeong-bi gravestone where governor’s achievements are engraved.
