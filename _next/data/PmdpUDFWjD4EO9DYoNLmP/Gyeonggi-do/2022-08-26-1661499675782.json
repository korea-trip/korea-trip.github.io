{"pageProps":{"content":"![Heyri Art Valley (헤이리 예술마을)](/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706535_image2_1.webp)\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> Heyri Art Valley is a neighborhood of inspiration, creative workshops, exhibitions, festivals, and education of all things creative arts. This neighborhood expanded into an art complex when artists from diverse fields of expertise began to gather during the development process of Paju Book City. The village’s name originates from Paju’s local song “Heyri Sound,” sung by farmers while working at the fields. The whole neighborhood is like a masterpiece due to the artworks displayed along the streets in harmony with nature’s beauty. The buildings were carefully designed as to prevent the manmade structures getting in the way from admiring the surrounding nature. For example, the neighborhood’s streets were designed to follow the curves set by nature without using any asphalt.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-31-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-31-946-8551|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|Mondays (Refer to website for details)|\n|usetime:|Varies by area (Refer to website for details)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Gallery, exhibition hall, museum, theater, art shop, book store, guesthouse, restaurant, cafe|\n|Admission Fees:|Free<br>* Fees may apply to exhibitions and galleries.|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706540_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706540_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706541_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706541_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706548_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706548_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706550_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706550_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706552_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706552_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706553_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706553_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706555_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706555_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706557_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706557_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706558_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706558_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706538_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706538_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-31-946-8551](tel:+82319468551)\n- [🏠www.heyri.net](http://heyri.net)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.7880651301\nlongitude: 126.6993124807\ntitle: 70-21, Heyrimaeul-gil, Paju-si, Gyeonggi-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway + Bus]<br>\n Hapjeong Station (Seoul Subway Line 2), Exit 2. <br> Take Bus No. 2200 or 900 and get off at Heyri Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-26-1661499675782","title":"Heyri Art Valley (헤이리 예술마을)","description":"Heyri Art Valley is a neighborhood of inspiration, creative workshops, exhibitions, festivals, and education of all things creative arts.
