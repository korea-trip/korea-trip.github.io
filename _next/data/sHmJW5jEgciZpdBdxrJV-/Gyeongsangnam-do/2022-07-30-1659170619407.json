It is a typical farming village, and its major produce is Jinyeong sweet persimmons and rice. Its name comes from the mound above it on Bonghwasan mountain, where in the past beacons were lit as a method of communication. Bonghwasan mountain is home to Bonghwasa temple and two famous valleys: Doduk (thief) valley on the east side, named because of the many thieves that used to operate in the area, and Yasi (fox) valley on the west side, which looks like a fox lying on its front, looking back at its tail. <Br><Br>\n\nBirthplace of the former President of Korea, Roh Moo-hyun<Br>\nThe birthplace of the former President of Korea, Roh Moo-hyun, is a brick house with a slate roof that consists of two small rooms and a kitchen. Although it is a shabby house, everything in it seems rare and precious to visitors. The earth, stones, and water, as well as household items, are popular with visitors. Some visitors even take stones and soil from the garden home with them in plastic bags, and some take water, believing that water from the ex-president‚Äôs birthplace is almost sacred.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-1688-0523, <BR> +82-55-344-1301|\n|parking:|Available|\n|usetime:|Shrine: Summer season 08:00-19:00 / Winter season 08:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-30-1659170619407/1611273_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659170619407/1611273_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659170619407/1611274_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659170619407/1611274_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659170619407/1611276_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659170619407/1611276_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659170619407/1611277_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659170619407/1611277_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659170619407/2610455_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659170619407/2610455_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-1688-0523](tel:+8216880523)\n- [üè†bongha.knowhow.or.kr</a> (Korean only)<br><a href=\"http://tour.gimhae.go.kr\" target=\"_blank\">tour.gimhae.go.kr](http://bongha.knowhow.or.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.3144525363\nlongitude: 128.7712292248\ntitle: 129, Bongha-ro, Gimhae-si, Gyeongsangnam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>From Seoul Express Bus Terminal, take a express bus to Gimhae Bus Terminal.<BR> From Gimhae Terminal Bus Stop, take Bus No.14 and get off at Jinnyeong Bus Stop.<BR>Transfer to Bus No. 57 and get off at Bonghamaeul Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-30-1659170619407","title":"Birthplace of the16th President of Korea, Roh Moo-hyun (ÏßÑÏòÅ Î¥âÌïòÎßàÏùÑÍ≥º ÎÖ∏Î¨¥ÌòÑ ÎåÄÌÜµÎ†π ÏÉùÍ∞Ä)","description":"Bongha Village is located 4.5km to the east of Jinyeong-eup, on the foot-slopes of Bonghwasan mountain.

Chokseongnu (historically known as ‚ÄòJangwollu‚Äô) has undergone eight renovations since its establishment in the 28th year of King Gojong (1241, Goryeo dynasty) and was once used as a commanding post for defending Jinju Palace in times of war. During times of peace, it was used for holding state examinations. <br><br>Although the structure was burnt down during the Korean War, it was restored in 1960 through the efforts of the Jinju Historical Site Preservation Society. The roof design features a mix of hipped and gabled styles and the stone pillars were built with rocks collected from Chokseoksan Mountain, located in Changwon-si. The wood used for the structure was brought from Odaesan Mountain, situated in Gangwon-do. Noticeable features of Chokseongnu are the four engraved signboards and a board that holds the works of renowned poets and calligraphers. Jinju Namgang Yudeung (Lantern) Festival is held every fall at the Jinjuseong Fortress.","regDate":"2022-07-30","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-30-1659199947652/2367499_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-07-30-1659199947652"},{"id":"2022-07-30-1659195649711","title":"Choi Champandaek (House of Choi Champan) (ÏµúÏ∞∏ÌåêÎåÅ)","description":"The House of Choi Champan is known as the setting of the famous novel \"Toji\" (\"The Land\") by noted novelist Park Kyongni.
