Despite being located on a small peak at just 350 meters above sea level, the observation deck at the summit offers views of the sea on clear days. The entrance to the tea plantation is also lined with tall cedar trees, adding a unique aspect to this plantation. Daehan Dawon Tea Plantation has been featured as a filming site in dramas such as “Summer Scent (2002),” “Legend of the Blue Sea (2017),” and “The Rebel (2017).”\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-61-852-4540|\n|parking:|Available 06:00-19:00 <br>* Vans and larger vehicles should use the parking lot for buses.|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round )|\n|usetime:|March-October 09:00-18:00 / November-February 09:00-17:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Film Locations:|Drama \"Summer Scent (2003),\" \"Ugly Alert (2013)\", \"The Legend of the Blue Sea (2016)\", \"Rebel: Thief Who Stole The People (2017)\"|\n|Tour Course Information:|[Course 1 (approx. 20 min)] Ticket Booth - Cedar Forest Path - Fountain Square - Main Square - Main Stairway - Main Observatory - Commercial Filming Spot - Cherry Blossoms Path - Dawon Rest Center - Cedar Forest Path - Ticket Booth <br /><br>[Course 2 (approx. 30 min)] Ticket Booth - Cedar Forest Path - Fountain Square - Main Square - Cherry Blossoms Path - Commercial Filming Spot - Main Observatory - Waterfall - Palgakjeong Pavilion - Dawon Rest Center - Cedar Forest Path - Ticket Booth <br /><br>[Course 3 (approx. 40 min)] Ticket Booth - Cedar Forest Path - Fountain Square - Main Square - Main Stairway - Main Observatory - Juniper Forest - Tea Plantation Observatory - Ocean Observatory - Cypress Pathway - Palgakjeong Pavilion - Dawon Rest Center - Cedar Forest Path - Ticket Booth <br /><br>[Course 4 (hiking course / approx. 1 hour)] Ticket Booth - Cedar Forest Path - Fountain Square - Main Square - Main Stairway - Main Observatory - Juniper Forest - Tea Plantation Observatory - Ocean Observatory - Cypress Pathway - Palgakjeong Pavilion - Dawon Rest Center - Yew Forest - Maple Forest - Bamboo Forest - Ticket Booth <br /><br>[Course 5 (easy course for the elderly)] Ticket Booth - Cedar Forest Path - Fountain Square - Main Square - Cherry Blossoms Path - Main Observatory - Commercial Filming Spot - Dawon Rest Center - Cedar Forest Path - Ticket Booth|\n|Shopping Information:|* Boseong Dawon green tea shop and a souvenir shop<br>* Green tea restaurant|\n|Admission Fees:|Adults: Individual 4,000 won / Group 3,000 won <br>Children & Senior citizens: 3,000 won|\n|Available Facilities:|Convenience amenities (product shop)|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Guide books in English available|\n|Reservation Info. for Foreigners:|Unguided tours|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-16-1673847347855/2652127_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-16-1673847347855/2652127_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-16-1673847347855/2652128_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-16-1673847347855/2652128_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-16-1673847347855/2652129_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-16-1673847347855/2652129_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-16-1673847347855/2652130_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-16-1673847347855/2652130_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-16-1673847347855/2652131_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-16-1673847347855/2652131_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-16-1673847347855/2652132_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-16-1673847347855/2652132_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-61-852-4540](tel:+82618524540)\n- [🏠dhdawon.com</a><br><a href=\"https://www.boseong.go.kr/tour/tourist/9tour/greentea_field\" target=\"_blank\">www.boseong.go.kr](http://dhdawon.com/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 34.7156927977\nlongitude: 127.0788124916\ntitle: 763-65, Nokcha-ro, Boseong-gun, Jeollanam-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-16-1673847347855","title":"Daehan Dawon Tea Plantation (대한다원)","description":"Daehan Dawon Tea Plantation produces high-quality green tea and is a popular tourist attraction year-round thanks to the vast rows of tea trees that line the hillside like a deep green carpet.

Metasequoia trees were planted along the street in the early 1970s by the Ministry of Internal Affairs after National Road 24 was rebuilt. At that time, the saplings were only 3 to 4 years old and their branches stretched sparsely out into the sky; now, the trees have grown so high that they seem to block out the sun. Thanks to these stately trees, in 2002 the Korea Forest Service selected the boulevard as one of the most beautiful roads in Korea. The 8.5-kilometer-long boulevard is one of the most popular driving routes in Korea, especially during summer when the trees&rsquo; lush green leaves are at their x_height of beauty.","regDate":"2023-01-16","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollanam-do","Culture/Art/History","Experience Programs","Cultural Districts"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-16-1673865516648/2650840_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollanam-do/2023-01-16-1673865516648"},{"id":"2023-01-16-1673861765838","title":"Damyang Changpyeong Samjinae Village [Slow City] (담양 창평 삼지내마을[슬로시티])","description":"Damyang Changpyeong Samjinae Village was the first Korean place designated as a slow city in 2007.
