The rites were first performed in the Goryeo dynasty by King Seongjong in the first month of 983 (2nd year of his reign), but was repeatedly adopted and abolished, and eventually stopped at the start of the Joseon dynasty. <br><br>Then in 1456 (2nd year of King Sejo), the practice was temporarily standardized and the rites were performed at Hwangudan Altar again in 1457. However, rites were again abolished in 1464 (10th year of King Sejo). It wasn‚Äôt until 1897 (34th year of King Gojong) when the Joseon dynasty was renamed as the Korean Empire and King Gojong ascended to emperor, that the rite was revived. <br><br>Now, Hwangungu Shrine and three stone drums stand at the location of the former altar complex. The three stone drums symbolize the instruments used for the rites. The shrine was completed in 1899, two years after the altar was started in 1897.

In 1922 when the Japanese colonial government sold buildings of Gyeonghuigung Palace to the public to build Gyeongseong Middle School in the location, the Hwanghakjeong Pavilion was bought and restored at the current location, which is an old site of Deunggwajeong Pavilion located to the North of Sajik Park.<br><br>It is relatively large for a pavilion, but the structure is plain and simple. There is a well behind the pavilion to the southwest. A rock behind the well has an engraved poem about eight beautiful scenes of Hwanghakjeong. Located to the right of the pavilion building (northeast of the building) is Hancheongak Pavilion, which has unique roof. To the west of the pavilion is Sauhoegwan Hall that was built with reinforced concrete.","regDate":"2022-08-02","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Palaces"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-02-1659468989162/1568125_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-08-02-1659468989162"},{"id":"2022-08-02-1659459694027","title":"Hongneung Arboretum (ÌôçÎ¶âÏàòÎ™©Ïõê)","description":"Hongneung Arboretum was the first arboretum in Korea, established in 1922 when experimental forests were built on Hongneung Royal Tomb, the burial mound of Queen Myeong-Seong.
