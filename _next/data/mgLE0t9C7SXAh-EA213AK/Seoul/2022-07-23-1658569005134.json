The various rocky peaks and the deep valleys give the mountain a rugged feel. The mountain's size and close proximity to Seoul make it easy for Seoul residents \nto make a day-trip. <br> <br>\n\nIn the spring, cherry blossoms are in full bloom near the entrance to the mountain, and a Rhododendron Festival is held when the rhododendrons are in full bloom. At the mountain's summit are Wongaksa Temple and Yeonjuam Hermitage, which were built by Taejo Yi Seong-gye (the founder of the Joseon dynasty) to ward off misfortune when he decided to move the capital to Seoul. There are also other temples and hermitages, and a ground radar observation post. Yeonjudae Hermitage, located atop a cliff, is where all the hiking trails of Gwanaksan Mountain meet.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-2-879-6521|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-23-1658569005134/1903011_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658569005134/1903011_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658569005134/1903012_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658569005134/1903012_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658569005134/1903013_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658569005134/1903013_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658569005134/1903015_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658569005134/1903015_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-2-879-6521](tel:+8228796521)\n- [üè†www.gwanak.go.kr](http://www.gwanak.go.kr/site/gwanak/area/areaMain.do?cateCont=Area02)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.4484036407\nlongitude: 126.9540987991\ntitle: Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nTake Bus No. 501, 5412, 5515, 5516, 5517, 5528, 5614, 6512, 6513, or  6514.<br>\n- Get off at Seoul National University Entrance bus stop.<br><br>\n\n[Subway]<br>\nSeoul National University Station (Seoul Subway Line 2), Exit 3.<br>\n- Transfer to any bus bound for Seoul National University Entrance bus stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-23-1658569005134","title":"Gwanaksan Mountain (Í¥ÄÏïÖÏÇ∞)","description":"Reaching 632.2 meters in x_height, Gwanaksan Mountain is the symbol and pride of Gwanak-gu district in Seoul.
