This district caters to visitors with yacht services and a variety of water sports such as windsurfing, kayaking and water skiing. Exceptionally popular is the ferry cruise that takes visitors to Hansando Island, which is located just off the coast of Tongyeong, and to the other scenic islands such as Bijindo and Maemuldo. <br><br>Mireukdo Island is connected to Tongyeong through an undersea tunnel, Chungmu Bridge and Tongyeong Bridge, making it even more accessible to visitors. At the center of the island is the towering Mireuksan Mountain. The panoramic Hallyeosudo Viewing Ropeway, which opened in 2008, takes visitors to the summit of Mireuksan Mountain. The top offers a commanding view of the forests and valleys below. On a clear day, visitors can even see the Japanese island of Tsushima. The mountain‚Äôs hiking trails are well-maintained and are suitable for short hikes. The most traveled trail is the one starting from Yonghwasa Temple.
