Chaeseokgang Cliff was formed from many layers of rocks stratified by the sea, and the blue sea and the rock cliffs together create quite a lovely picture. It is nature‚Äôs masterpiece of stratification, and visitors can observe interesting structures and shapes that cannot be seen elsewhere.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|expagerange:|Open to visitors of all ages|\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-63-580-4331|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Sunrise-Sunset|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Tour Course Information:|* Nearby attractions: Jeokbyeokgang Cliff - Chaeseokgang Cliff - Film Theme Park - Jeolla Jwasu Filming Set - Nue Town<br />* Masil-gil Course 3|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Parking Fees:|Accommodations, pavilion, cafe, drinking fountain, visitors information center|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Geopark guide available<br />* Reservation required<br>* Inquiries: +82-63-581-5114, +82-63-584-2114|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-31-1659264028021/252454_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659264028021/252454_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659264028021/252455_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659264028021/252455_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659264028021/252456_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659264028021/252456_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659264028021/252457_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659264028021/252457_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659264028021/252458_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659264028021/252458_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659264028021/252459_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659264028021/252459_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659264028021/689387_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659264028021/689387_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659264028021/689389_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659264028021/689389_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659264028021/689390_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659264028021/689390_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659264028021/689392_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659264028021/689392_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-63-580-4331](tel:+82635804331)\n- [üè†www.jbgeopark.kr](http://www.jbgeopark.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.6279822530\nlongitude: 126.4700297445\ntitle: Gyeokpo-ri, Buan-gun, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Express/Intercity Bus]<br>\nFrom Dong Seoul Bus Terminal or Seoul Central City Bus Terminal, take a bus to Buan Bus Terminal.<br>\nFrom Buan Terminal, take a bus to Gyeokpo Terminal.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-31-1659264028021","title":"Chaeseokgang Cliff (Jeonbuk National Geopark) (Ï±ÑÏÑùÍ∞ï (Ï†ÑÎ∂Å ÏÑúÌï¥ÏïàÍ∂å Íµ≠Í∞ÄÏßÄÏßàÍ≥µÏõê))","description":"Chaeseokgang Cliff refers to a rocky cliff and the sea around it near the Gyeokpohang Port and Dagibong areas on Byeonsanbando Peninsula.
