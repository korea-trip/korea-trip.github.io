From Darangswi Oreum, visitors can overlook tourist attractions such as Seongsan Ilchulbong (Sunrise Peak), Udo Island, Hallasan Mountain, coastlines, and various parasitic cones.<br><br>\n\nThe mountain has an oval shape from south to north with a steep incline. The top has a large, deep funnel-shaped crater that still preserves its original shape unlike craters in cones. The name Darangswi is derived from the fact that the mountain looks like a moon ('Da' meaning 'Moon' and 'Swi' meaning 'Mountain' in the Jeju dialect).<br><br>\n\nTrees are scattered here and there at the top, and the outskirts of the mountain are decorated with cedar trees. Meadow plants such as Aster yomena populate most of the mountain. A gentle hill to the right of Darangswi Oreum is called Akkeun Darangswi Oreum (also called Sowol Nangak). Meaning 'small,' 'Akkeun' is both old Korean and Jeju dialect.<br><br>\n\nDarangswi Oreum hosts Wollang Peak Sunrise Festival every year allowing visitors to see the spectacular full moon from the crater. There are wooden stairs in place for easy ascent, and the mountain is also a popular site for paragliders.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • Jeju Travel Hotline: +82-64-740-6000~1|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Visitor Information Center|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-19-1658245342348/2652527_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658245342348/2652527_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658245342348/2652529_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658245342348/2652529_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658245342348/2652530_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658245342348/2652530_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658245342348/2652531_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658245342348/2652531_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658245342348/2652532_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658245342348/2652532_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-64-740-6000](tel:+82647406000)\n- [🏠www.visitjeju.net](http://www.visitjeju.net/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.4759988880\nlongitude: 126.8228310320\ntitle: San 6, Sehwa-ri, Jeju-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus + Taxi]<br>\nFrom Jeju International Airport, take a bus towards Sehwa-ri (Dongilju & Eupmyeonsunhwan Bus)  and get off at Sehwa-ri Bus Stop. <BR>Take a taxi for approx. 5km.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-19-1658245342348","title":"Darangswi Oreum (Wollangbong Peak) (다랑쉬오름(월랑봉))","description":"Located the Northeastern part of Jeju Island, Darangswi Oreum is a parasitic volcano that stands about 380 meters above sea level.

Geomunoreum has an altitude of 456 meters and with lava tubes spreading out in a streamlined shape, its lava tube system is the largest of its kind on Jeju Island. The name is said to have originated when the local islanders called the cone \"Geomun,\" which is translated to “black,” referring to the dense forest formed on the crater. However, according to researchers and linguists, the term \"Geomun\" may have originated from a word from the Gojoseon period which were used to refer to deities, inferring that the name Geomunoreum actually means \"holy hill.\"<br><br>Geomunoreum Lava Tube System consists of roughly 20 lava tubes that follow the cone's slope to the northeast, stretching out all the way to the shore.
