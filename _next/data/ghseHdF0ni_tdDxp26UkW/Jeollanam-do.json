In addition to the gorgeous scenery, a major draw is the great seafood like fresh mullets, long-legged octopuses, small shrimps, and other local specialties said to provide strength during the sweltering summer heat. Since the beach has not yet been discovered by many tourists, visitors will be able to have a calm and relaxing time. The nearby coastal road is a perfect driving course with a stunning view of the sunset.","regDate":"2022-08-01","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollanam-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-01-1659368778986/190577_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollanam-do/2022-08-01-1659368778986","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Jeollanam-do/2022-08-01-1659368778986"},{"id":"2022-08-01-1659364800979","title":"Amnok Resort (압록유원지)","description":"Situated at the joining point of two rivers, Seomjin and Boseong, Amnok Resort is renowned as a summer vacation spot with a 100,000m² beach.
