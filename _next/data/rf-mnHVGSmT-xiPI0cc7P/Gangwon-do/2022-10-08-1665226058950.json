Biryongpokpo Falls was named after the shape of the water stream of the falls (pokpo) resembling a dragon (ryong) ascending (bi) to heaven. Their powerful water streams pouring into the narrow and rough valley look like a legendary dragon. There is another tale associated with Biryongpokpo Falls. A dragon lived here, and one day villagers offered a maiden to the dragon to break the drought. Then, the dragon flew up to the sky, and there were no more droughts in the village. The waterfalls drop 16 m to the ground and their loud sound resonates in the valley. In winter, the waterfalls freeze and the frozen water columns offer another magnificent view. A clear pond is formed beneath the falls and around which there is a wooden observation deck. Biryongpokpo Falls and Surroundings in Seoraksan Mountain were designated as the Scenic Site No. 95.
