According to the principles of feng shui, the area is an ideal place for a temple ‚Äì with the 12 mountain peaks surrounding the temple like the petals of a lotus flower. \n<br><br>\nThe temple is home to two precious historical remains; one is the board of Yuribojeon that King Gongmin of Goryeo wrote upon and the other is Jibul. Yuribojeon is the building where Yaksa-yorae-bul (the Medicine Buddha Statute) is housed and Jibul is a Buddha statute made of paper that was painted with gold.\n<br><br>\nAt the back of the temple is Bosalbong Peak looking out towards Cheongnyangsan Mountain. A 30 minute walk along the hiking trail will lead you to Eungjinjeon, a hermitage with a beautiful view where the great monk Wonhyo once stayed. Behind Eungjinjeon stands Geumtapbong Peak and the sheer cliffs below. The peak was named Geumtapbong (meaning ‚Äògolden pagoda‚Äô in Korean) since it looks like a nine-story pagoda with pine trees growing around the base. In the autumn, the beautiful red, gold and orange hues of the maple trees are a true sight to behold.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-54-1330 <BR>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-54-672-1446|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Hiking Course:|* Gwangseongnaru - Naecheongnyangsa - Summit - Oecheongnyangsa - Ireumsil<br> *&nbsp;Nammyeonri - Oecheongnyangsa - Gimsaenggul - Gyeongilbong Peak - Cheongnyangsan - Naecheongnyangsa - Osandang - Gwangseongnaruteo - Gwangseok|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-29-1659120479282/221681_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659120479282/221681_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659120479282/221682_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659120479282/221682_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659120479282/221683_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659120479282/221683_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659120479282/221684_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659120479282/221684_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659120479282/221687_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659120479282/221687_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659120479282/222044_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659120479282/222044_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-54-672-1446](tel:+82546721446)\n- [üè†www.cheongryangsa.org](http://www.cheongryangsa.org/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.7888798599\nlongitude: 128.9199298421\ntitle: 199-152, Cheongnyangsan-gil, Bonghwa-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Dong \nSeoul Bus Terminal, take an intercity bus to Bonghwa Bus Terminal.<br>\nFrom Bonghwa Bus Terminal, take a taxi for approx. 45 min.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-29-1659120479282","title":"Cheongnyangsa Temple - Bonghwa (Ï≤≠ÎüâÏÇ¨-Î¥âÌôî)","description":"Located in Cheongnyangsan Mountain Provincial Park, Cheongnyangsa Temple was built by the great monk Wonhyo in 663, the 3rd year of King Munmu of the Silla Kingdom.

When Kim Jeongho made the Daedongyeojido Map, he visited this place seven times to confirm this area is in fact the easternmost part of Korea. Following the resources of Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute, the sunrise time of Homigot on January 1 is at 7 32 am, making it the earliest first sunrise of each year in Korea. The plaza was built to commemorate these research findings with the national Sunrise Festival. Nearby attractions include Koreas largest lighthouse, Homigot Lighthouse, established in 1908; Lighthouse Museum; Monument to Commemorate Lee Yuk-sa‚Äôs Patriotism; and Daebo Seawater Bath, using pure seawater of the East Sea. <br><br>When completed, Homigot Tourism Complex and Homigot Specialized Ocean Leisure Complex will be the largest tourism complex in the eastern coast district. It will include an ocean aquarium, Ocean Ecological Park, Youth Training facilities, beach dome, accommodation facilities, and other various stores as well. <br><br> Sangsaeng‚Äôs Hand, a two-part bronze sculpture shaped like a pair of hands, was constructed in December 1999. It is a signature symbol of the sunrise festival. The left hand is on the land and the right hand is in the ocean. It was built to give the message that all people are living together by helping one another like Sangsaeng, meaning coexistence in Korean. The base of the platform is an image of the sun and its two round rings refer to harmony. These two hands have memorial sprits of reconciliation and coexistence for celebrating a new millennium.","regDate":"2022-12-01","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-01-1669884185831/2527505_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-01-1669884185831"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
