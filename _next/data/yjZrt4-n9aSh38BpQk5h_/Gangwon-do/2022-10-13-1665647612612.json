{"pageProps":{"content":"![Sokcho Lighthouse Observatory (속초등대전망대)](/2022-10-13-1665647612612/2711170_image2_1.webp)\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> It is No. 1 of Sokcho’s Eight Sights. This white lighthouse creates a picturesque view along with the surrounding blue sea. Sokcho Lighthouse Observatory was originally just a lighthouse, but now, it is opened to the public and plays a role of an observatory. Walking up along the wooden deck trail among the bamboo grove leads you to the observatory, which offers an open view of the deep blue East Sea, the Cheongchoho Lake, which is home to migratory birds, and the magnificent scenery of Seoraksan Mountain. Viewed from the high tower, the East Sea unfolds its boundless ocean and sometimes it looks like a calm lake but can become an energetic ocean full of vitality. Built in 1957, Sokcho Lighthouse still lights up for ships at night. The bright light and sound of the beacon, which has been in service since the lighthouse’s establishment, can show the waterway to a boat, which is about 35 km away from the lighthouse. Right next to the observatory, Yeonggeumjeong Pavilion is situated.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-33-633-3406|\n|parking:|Available (10 spaces)|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Summer season (April–October) 06:00–20:00<br />Winter season (November–March) 07:00–18:00<br />Exhibition Hall & Observatory 09:00–18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Activity Fees:|Free of charge|\n|Available Facilities:|Observatory|\n|Parking Fees:|Free of charge|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|None|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-10-13-1665647612612/182603_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-13-1665647612612/182603_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-13-1665647612612/676940_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-13-1665647612612/676940_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-13-1665647612612/677047_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-13-1665647612612/677047_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-13-1665647612612/677054_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-13-1665647612612/677054_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-13-1665647612612/2711171_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-13-1665647612612/2711171_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-13-1665647612612/2711172_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-13-1665647612612/2711172_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-33-633-3406](tel:+82336333406)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 38.2137204042\nlongitude: 128.6000930800\ntitle: 8-28, Yeonggeumjeong-ro 5-gil, Sokcho-si, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Express/Intercity Bus]<br>\nTake a bus from Dong Seoul Bus Terminal to Sokcho Express Bus Terminal.<br><br>\n\n[Bus]<br>\nGet off at Yeonggeumjeong Entrance Bus Stop.<br>\nBus No. 1, 1-1, 3, 3-1, 7, 9, 9-1, 9-2, 13-1, 13-2, 15, 16, 18, 19, 22<br>\nApprox. 5min-walk to the lighthouse\n","data":{"id":"2022-10-13-1665647612612","title":"Sokcho Lighthouse Observatory (속초등대전망대)","description":"It is No. 1 of Sokcho’s Eight Sights.
