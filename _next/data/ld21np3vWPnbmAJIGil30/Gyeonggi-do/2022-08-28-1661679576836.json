Janganmun Gate served as the main gate because the king would pass from this gate when arriving from Hanyang, the capital city, now modern-day Seoul. It is interesting to note that this gate is larger than Sungryemun Gate in Seoul.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-031-228-4416|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|March-October 09:00-18:00<br>November-February 09:00-17:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|[Suwon Hawseong Fortress]<br>Adults: Individuals 1,000 won / Groups 700 won<br>Teenagers: Individuals 700 won / Groups 500 won<br>Children: Individuals 500 won / Groups 300 won<br><br>[Hwaseong Haenggung Palace] <br>Adults: Individuals 1,500 won / Groups 1,200 won<br>Teenagers: Individuals 1,000 won / Groups 800 won<br>Children: Individuals 700 won / Groups 500 won<br><br>* Groups: 20 persons or more|\n|Parking Fees:|Small/Mid-sized car 2,000 won for 3 hours / 10,000 won for one-day<br>Large-sized car 4,000 won for 3 hours / 15,000 won for one-day<br>* 200 won for each additional 10 minutes after 3 hours|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|English, Japanese|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-28-1661679576836/734408_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-28-1661679576836/734408_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-28-1661679576836/734409_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-28-1661679576836/734409_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-28-1661679576836/734411_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-28-1661679576836/734411_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-28-1661679576836/734412_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-28-1661679576836/734412_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-28-1661679576836/1092241_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-28-1661679576836/1092241_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-28-1661679576836/2514364_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-28-1661679576836/2514364_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-28-1661679576836/2514365_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-28-1661679576836/2514365_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-28-1661679576836/2514366_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-28-1661679576836/2514366_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-28-1661679576836/2514367_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-28-1661679576836/2514367_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-031-228-4416](tel:+820312284416)\n- [üè†suwon.go.kr</a> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br><a href=\"http://www.swcf.or.kr/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"web\">www.swcf.or.kr](http://www.suwon.go.kr/web/visitsuwon/index.do)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.2888704361\nlongitude: 127.0142422513\ntitle: 910, Jeongjo-ro, Paldal-gu, Suwon-si, Gyeonggi-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nSuwon Station (Seoul Subway Line 1), Underground Shopping Mall Exit 3.

Gongneung is the royal tomb of Queen Jangsun (1445-1461), consort of King Yejong, the 8th ruler of the Joseon dynasty. She died when she was still a crown princess, so her tomb is very simple. There is not even a ‚ÄúMangjuseok,‚Äù which is the name for the pair of stones that stand on either side of the mound. <br><br>Sulleung is the tomb of Queen Gonghye (1456-1474), a consort of King Seongjong, the 9th ruler of the Joseon dynasty. Sulleung is similar to Gongneung in many ways, but it has more stonework. Queen Gonghye was the 4th daughter of Han Myeong-Hoe, a high-ranking government officer, and a sister of Queen Jangsun, who is buried in Gongneung. This was the only time in the history of the Joseon dynasty that two sisters both became queen.<br><br>Yeongneung is the tomb of the posthumously designated king, King Jinjong (1719-1728), the first son of King Yeongjo, and Queen Hyosun (1715-1751).
