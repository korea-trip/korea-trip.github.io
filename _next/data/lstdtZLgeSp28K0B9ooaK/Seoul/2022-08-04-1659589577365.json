Iljasan Mountain is one of the best spots in Seoul to watch the sunrise. Located on the mountain is the house of Master Lee Jip (pen-name Dunchon), providing a good getaway spot for local residents. Lee Jip was a loyal government official during the reign of King Gongmin during the late Goryeo dynasty. He was forced to move to an underground tunnel in the southwest side of Iljasan Mountain to avoid entrapment by Shin Don, a person of influence at the time. While living in hiding, he took the pen-name Dunchon (meaning drawing back to the countryside) to symbolize the hardships he was going through. The nearby area was named after him, being called Dunchon-dong.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-2-3425-6443|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Available Facilities:|Indoor and outdoor badminton venue, gymnasium, X-game hall, plaza, parking lot, Chohwaryu Hall, ecological pond, etc.|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659478_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659478_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659479_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659479_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659480_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659480_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659481_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659481_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659482_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659482_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659485_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659485_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659487_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659487_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659490_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659490_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659492_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659492_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659486_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659486_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n\n- [🏠parks.seoul.go.kr](http://parks.seoul.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5327334966\nlongitude: 127.1508007360\ntitle: 660, Dongnam-ro, Gangdong-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\n- Take Blue Bus No. 361 and get off at Bohun Hospital. <Br>\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-04-1659589577365","title":"Iljasan Mountain Natural Park (일자산자연공원)","description":"Iljasan Mountain is the tallest peak in Gangdong-gu, Seoul, providing the western boundary between Gangdong-gu and Hanam-si, Gyeonggi-do.

The Military Museum displays treasures and materials from each branch of the military, while visitors can see the history of the military and lifestyle of cadets at the memorial hall.

The theme park provides children with a chance to experience jobs that they might want to have when they grow up! Job experiences include working as a policeman, flight attendant, firefighter, or chef (uniforms are provided). When you work hard in Kidzania, you get paid in Kidzo (a virtual currency). You can put your money in the bank for your next visit or purchase goods at the department store. In order to make the environment as realistic as possible, every building, car, and tree is reduced to 2/3 its real size, helping children feel more adult-like in their new world! Kidzania mimics a real city environment, has diverse jobs, and is full of events. When there is a fire, a fireman rushes to help, and a news reporter covers the story. While 911 paramedics give first aid to fire victims, in another part of “town” delivery personnel are dropping off packages. Kidzania teaches the next generation how to live as responsible members of society and gives them an introduction to how the economy works.","regDate":"2022-08-04","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Experience Programs","Unique Experience"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-04-1659656133025/2031380_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-08-04-1659656133025"},{"id":"2022-08-04-1659652608116","title":"KT Square (KT스퀘어)","description":"KT Square is a multi-complex that offers various cultural performances as well as hands-on experiences of the latest in IT technology.
