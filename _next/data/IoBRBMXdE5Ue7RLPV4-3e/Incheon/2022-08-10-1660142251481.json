The monk picked the lotus flower petals and blew them into the air. He then built a temple where each of the petals had landed, naming the temples according to their corresponding color  Jeokseoksa Temple, formerly Jeokryeonsa Temple (red lotus), Baengnyeonsa Temple (white lotus), Cheongryeonsa Temple (blue lotus), Hwangryeonsa Temple (yellow lotus), and Heungnyeonsa Temple (black lotus). <br><br>Around 130 dolmens are distributed along the foot of Goryeosan Mountain.

In the 19th year of his reign, King Gojong moved the capital to Ganghwa on account of its natural and strategic advantages. During the Byeongjahoran (Chinese invasion of Korea) in 1637, the palace was lost by force to the Qing dynasty of China. Later, Joseon Dynasty palace building and Ganghwa Yusubu (Ganghwa governor‚Äôs office) buildings existed in the Goryeo palace site but were destroyed by the French army during the Byeonginyangyo (French Campaign against Korea). Nowadays, the only structures that remain are the Dongheon main office (built in 1638) and Ibangcheong administration office (built in 1654). The palace and its subsidiary buildings were restored in 1977. It has historical lessons of the spirit of independence and overcoming national crisis.","regDate":"2022-08-11","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-11-1660185152853/1575652_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-08-11-1660185152853"},{"id":"2022-08-10-1660174693655","title":"Geojampo Beach (Í±∞Ïû†Ìè¨Ìï¥Î≥Ä)","description":"Although Geojampo beach is on the west coast, the estuary is facing the east allowing for a great view of the sunset and sunrise.

Ganghwasanseong Fortress originally had interior and exterior walls, but only the interior wall remains today.  It has an approximate circumference of 1.2km.  The exterior mud wall was approximately 9km in circumference with 8 gates.  The huge exterior wall was built along the side of the east channel of Ganghwa, but no longer exists today.
