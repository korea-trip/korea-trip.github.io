Metasequoia trees were planted along the street in the early 1970s by the Ministry of Internal Affairs after National Road 24 was rebuilt. At that time, the saplings were only 3 to 4 years old and their branches stretched sparsely out into the sky; now, the trees have grown so high that they seem to block out the sun. Thanks to these stately trees, in 2002 the Korea Forest Service selected the boulevard as one of the most beautiful roads in Korea. The 8.5-kilometer-long boulevard is one of the most popular driving routes in Korea, especially during summer when the trees&rsquo; lush green leaves are at their x_height of beauty.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-61-380-3149|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|The day of Seollal (Lunar New Year‚Äôs Day) & Chuseok (Korean Thanksgiving Day)|\n|usetime:|May-August: 09:00-19:00<br>September-April: 09:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Film Locations:|Films \"Wanee & Junah (2001),\" \"May 18 (2007)\"<br />Variety program \"1 Night, 2 Days\"|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Gallery, cafe, etc.|\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 2,000 won / Teenagers 1,000 won / Children 700 won<br>Groups - Adults 1,600 won / Teenagers 700 won / Children 500 won<br><br>* Group: 20 or more people<br>* Free admission: Preschoolers (ages 6 & under), senior citizens (ages 65 & over)|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-16-1673865516648/2515888_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-16-1673865516648/2515888_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-16-1673865516648/2515986_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-16-1673865516648/2515986_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-16-1673865516648/2515989_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-16-1673865516648/2515989_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-16-1673865516648/2515991_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-16-1673865516648/2515991_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-61-380-3149](tel:+82613803149)\n- [üè†\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Îã¥ÏñëÍµ∞ Î¨∏ÌôîÍ¥ÄÍ¥ë ÏÇ¨Ïù¥Ìä∏Î°ú Ïù¥Îèô\">tour.damyang.go.kr](http://www.damyang.go.kr/tour/board/view.damyang?boardId=BBS_0000169&menuCd=DOM_000000301001001000&paging=ok&startPage=1&dataSid=319428<br>)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.3238535634\nlongitude: 127.0041510748\ntitle: 12, Metasequoia-ro, Damyang-gun, Jeollanam-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-16-1673865516648","title":"Damyang Metasequoia-lined Road (Îã¥Ïñë Î©îÌÉÄÏÑ∏ÏøºÏù¥ÏïÑÍ∏∏)","description":"Damyang Metasequoia-lined Road is one of Koreas most beautiful paths.

Although the difference in the landscape between high and low tide is considerable, efforts have been made to make up for the shortcomings. A swimming pool has been installed over an area of 8,910 square meters, for swimming even during low tide. Also, various facilities have been installed for the visitors convenience. A long, wooden bridge was installed for the viewing of the mud flats and sea creatures during low tide.

Most dinosaur tracks found in Korea are located in coastal areas in cities like Haenam and Boseong, so the discovery in the inner region of Jeollanam-do was a first. Most prints here come from carnivorous dinaosaurs of the Cretaceous period. The site is famous for there being tracks from no fewer than five different dinosaurs, as well as for being one of the longest trails and most direct examples of the exact movements of the dinosaurs. The tracks of one dinosaur are the longest in the world, stretching for 40 meters. Based on the foot size of 20-22 centimeters with a stride of approximately 90 centimeters, it is estimated that the prints were formed by a 4-5 meter tall Koolasuchus. In addition to the canivorous dinosaurs, tracks were found of 12 herbivorous dinosaurs, as well as fossilized plants. These plants offer much assistance in the research of herbivorous dinosaur diets.","regDate":"2023-01-17","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollanam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Eco-Tourism Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-17-1673944760289/1608223_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollanam-do/2023-01-17-1673944760289"},{"id":"2023-01-17-1673933770532","title":"Dasan Chodang (Historic Site Related to Jeong Yak-yong) (Îã§ÏÇ∞Ï¥àÎãπ (Îã§ÏÇ∞ Ï†ïÏïΩÏö© Ïú†Ï†ÅÏßÄ))","description":"Dasan Chodang is the house where Jeong Yak-yong (pen-name Dasan, 1762-1836) lived during his exile.

After he was expelled to Ganjin for writing a secret letter of appeal for religious freedom, which later was named ‚Äòthe Hwang Sa-yeong Baekseo‚Äô, he lived in the house for 18 years while studying practical learning (‚ÄòSilhak‚Äô in Korean). Most of his famous books were written in Dasan Chodang. While walking along a road near Dasan Chodang, you can see the Cheonilgak pavilion, which offers a great view of beautiful Gangjin Bay.
