Under the pen name Yeongnang, he was active in literature until his death on September 29, 1950. Among the 80 poems he published, more than 60 were written in this place where he lived a life resisting Japanese imperialism and refusing to change his name to a Japanese name. After he moved to Seoul in 1948, his birthplace was resold several times, but the county of Gangjin-gun bought it in 1985 to restore it to its original state with a thatched-roof. The site features many of the poet‚Äôs writing materials and the site has a small well, camellia trees, jangdokdae (a platform where large clay pots used for storing food are kept), persimmon trees, and a peony garden.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-61-430-3363|\n|parking:|Available (Free)|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-02-1659446456971/1606607_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659446456971/1606607_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659446456971/1606608_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659446456971/1606608_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659446456971/1606609_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659446456971/1606609_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659446456971/1606610_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659446456971/1606610_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659446456971/1606611_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659446456971/1606611_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659446456971/1606612_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659446456971/1606612_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659446456971/1606613_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659446456971/1606613_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-61-430-3185](tel:+82614303185)\n- [üè†www.gangjin.go.kr</a> (Korean, English, Chinese, Japanese)<br><a href=\"http://www.cha.go.kr/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"web\">www.cha.go.kr](http://www.gangjin.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 34.6421208134\nlongitude: 126.7651001989\ntitle: 15, Yeongnangsaengga-gil, Gangjin-gun, Jeollanam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \nFrom Seoul Central City Bus Terminal (Express Bus Terminal Station, Subway Line 3, 7, 9), take an intercity bus bound for Gangjin.<br>\n\n<br>From Gangjin Bus Terminal, Walk about 400 m following\nthe signs for Birthplace of Yeongnang.\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-02-1659446456971","title":"Birthplace of Yeongnang (Í∞ïÏßÑÏòÅÎûëÏÉùÍ∞Ä)","description":"Kim Yun-sik was born on this site on January 16, 1903 as the first-born of two sons and three daughters.

A long, wooden bridge was installed for the viewing of the mud flats and sea creatures during low tide.

Most dinosaur tracks found in Korea are located in coastal areas in cities like Haenam and Boseong, so the discovery in the inner region of Jeollanam-do was a first. Most prints here come from carnivorous dinaosaurs of the Cretaceous period. The site is famous for there being tracks from no fewer than five different dinosaurs, as well as for being one of the longest trails and most direct examples of the exact movements of the dinosaurs. The tracks of one dinosaur are the longest in the world, stretching for 40 meters. Based on the foot size of 20-22 centimeters with a stride of approximately 90 centimeters, it is estimated that the prints were formed by a 4-5 meter tall Koolasuchus. In addition to the canivorous dinosaurs, tracks were found of 12 herbivorous dinosaurs, as well as fossilized plants. These plants offer much assistance in the research of herbivorous dinosaur diets.","regDate":"2023-01-17","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollanam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Eco-Tourism Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-17-1673944760289/1608223_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollanam-do/2023-01-17-1673944760289"},{"id":"2023-01-17-1673933770532","title":"Dasan Chodang (Historic Site Related to Jeong Yak-yong) (Îã§ÏÇ∞Ï¥àÎãπ (Îã§ÏÇ∞ Ï†ïÏïΩÏö© Ïú†Ï†ÅÏßÄ))","description":"Dasan Chodang is the house where Jeong Yak-yong (pen-name Dasan, 1762-1836) lived during his exile.

After he was expelled to Ganjin for writing a secret letter of appeal for religious freedom, which later was named ‚Äòthe Hwang Sa-yeong Baekseo‚Äô, he lived in the house for 18 years while studying practical learning (‚ÄòSilhak‚Äô in Korean). Most of his famous books were written in Dasan Chodang. While walking along a road near Dasan Chodang, you can see the Cheonilgak pavilion, which offers a great view of beautiful Gangjin Bay.
