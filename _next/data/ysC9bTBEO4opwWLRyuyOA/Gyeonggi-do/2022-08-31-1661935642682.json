The site holds the graves of Saint Andreas Kim Daegeon, Korea‚Äôs first Catholic Saint; his mother Ursula; Bishop Ferr√©ol, the third head of the Joseon parish who ordained Priest Kim; and Vincentius Lee Minsik who buried Saint Kim‚Äôs body. Visitors can feel the peaceful and serene atmosphere when walking around the site. \nThe reason it came to be called ‚ÄòMirinae‚Äô is that Korean Catholics came to this place in secret to avoid persecution during the late Joseon dynasty, and the lamplight coming from their homes in the village where they settled resembled the starlight of the Milky Way.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<BR> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-31-674-1256|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Tour Course Information:|Downtown Anseong - Guramsa Temple (4 km) - Nogokhosu Lake ( 6km) - Nogok three-way street (0.5 km) - Mirinae Holy Site (5 km)<br><br> * Anseong I.C. - Chungang University Entrance (Anseong Machum Museum) - Bogae-myeon (Art Center Mano) - Namsadang Training Center - Neorigul Cultural Village - Taepyeongmu Training Center - Gosam-myeon - Mirinae Holy Site|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-31-1661935642682/190824_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-31-1661935642682/190824_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-31-1661935642682/486103_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-31-1661935642682/486103_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-31-1661935642682/1589719_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-31-1661935642682/1589719_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-31-1661935642682/1589720_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-31-1661935642682/1589720_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-31-1661935642682/1589721_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-31-1661935642682/1589721_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-31-1661935642682/1589722_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-31-1661935642682/1589722_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-31-1661935642682/1589724_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-31-1661935642682/1589724_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-31-1661935642682/1589725_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-31-1661935642682/1589725_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-31-674-1256](tel:+82316741256)\n- [üè†www.mirinai.or.kr](http://www.mirinai.or.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.1461885444\nlongitude: 127.2586379926\ntitle: 420, Mirinaeseongji-ro, Anseong-si, Gyeonggi-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>\nFrom Dong Seoul Bus Terminal, take a bus to Anseong Bus Terminal.\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-31-1661935642682","title":"Mirinae Holy Site (ÎØ∏Î¶¨ÎÇ¥ ÏÑ±ÏßÄ)","description":"The word ‚ÄòMirinae,‚Äô from the Mirinae Holy Site in Anseong, Gyeonggi-do, is a pure Korean word for the Milky Way.

The site used to be a sandpit before it was turned into a wetland.  Effluent from wastewater treatment plants, which in the past was released directly into the Hangang River, now passes through several ponds with various aquatic plants and a one kilometer-long waterway so that it can be naturally purified.  This has contributed to an improvement in the water quality of the Hangang River. The center was built to restore the Namhangang Riverside area, which was destroyed due to sand extraction, and to restore its natural ecology of willow trees, reeds, and birds. The center organizes a number of ecological excursion programs for children.","regDate":"2022-09-08","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Eco-Tourism Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-08-1662623445837/1099393_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-09-08-1662623445837"},{"id":"2022-09-08-1662620770343","title":"Sujongsa Temple (ÏàòÏ¢ÖÏÇ¨)","description":"Sujongsa Temple is a branch temple of Bongseonsa Temple, located near the top of Ungilsan Mountain.
