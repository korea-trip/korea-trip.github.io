This structure was built on the western side of Namhansanseong Fortress as one of the four command posts. During the Manchu Invasion of 1636, King Injo personally commanded and encouraged the troops from here. They held out for 45 days against a Qing force of 120,000, before finally being forced to surrender and accept vassal status to the Manchu Empire.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-31-760-4821|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-09-08-1662618307075/1957745_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-08-1662618307075/1957745_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-08-1662618307075/1957749_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-08-1662618307075/1957749_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-08-1662618307075/1957750_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-08-1662618307075/1957750_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-08-1662618307075/1957751_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-08-1662618307075/1957751_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-08-1662618307075/1957752_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-08-1662618307075/1957752_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-08-1662618307075/1957744_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-08-1662618307075/1957744_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-08-1662618307075/1957748_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-08-1662618307075/1957748_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-31-760-4821](tel:+82317604821)\n- [🏠www.gjcity.go.kr</a> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br><a title=\"new page popup\" href=\"http://www.cha.go.kr\" target=\"_blank\">www.cha.go.kr](http://www.gjcity.go.kr/tour/main.do)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.4798539882\nlongitude: 127.1765554537\ntitle: 107-65, Namhansanseong-ro 780beon-gil, Gwangju-si, Gyeonggi-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nSanseong Station (Seoul Subway Line 8), Exit 1<br>\nWalk straight, following the main road at the intersection.<br>\nFrom Korea Polytech University Bus Stop, take Bus No. 9 or 52.<br>\nGet off at Namhansanseong Fortress Bus Stop.<br>\nTake the trail to reach Sueojangdae Post.\n","data":{"id":"2022-09-08-1662618307075","title":"Sueojangdae Post (수어장대)","description":"Sueojangdae Post (Defense Commander's Post) is a two-story military facility used as a lookout post as well as for directing battles.

The site used to be a sandpit before it was turned into a wetland.  Effluent from wastewater treatment plants, which in the past was released directly into the Hangang River, now passes through several ponds with various aquatic plants and a one kilometer-long waterway so that it can be naturally purified.  This has contributed to an improvement in the water quality of the Hangang River. The center was built to restore the Namhangang Riverside area, which was destroyed due to sand extraction, and to restore its natural ecology of willow trees, reeds, and birds. The center organizes a number of ecological excursion programs for children.","regDate":"2022-09-08","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Eco-Tourism Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-08-1662623445837/1099393_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-09-08-1662623445837"},{"id":"2022-09-08-1662620770343","title":"Sujongsa Temple (수종사)","description":"Sujongsa Temple is a branch temple of Bongseonsa Temple, located near the top of Ungilsan Mountain.
