Sinseon in Korean means supernatural beings; the beauty of this spot is said to attract such beings to come frolic. The blue and yellow colors layered on the rocks tell a unique history of the terrain. A stairway from the road leads directly to the lookout point. <br />Just past a gas station along the coastal highway, Sinseondae Observatory reveals itself. Walking out onto the rocks of Sinseondae, views of the surrounding islands and incredible landscape open up to viewers. Many commercials and TV shows have been filmed here taking advantage of this amazing setting. April and May are the perfect times to see the bright-yellow canola flowers across the island.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-55-639-3000|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Film Locations:|Drama \"Merry Go Round (2003),\" movies \"The Big Swindle (2004)\" & \"The Windmill Palm Grove (2005)\"|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-25-1671943124627/212107_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-25-1671943124627/212107_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-25-1671943124627/212109_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-25-1671943124627/212109_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-25-1671943124627/212110_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-25-1671943124627/212110_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-25-1671943124627/212111_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-25-1671943124627/212111_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-25-1671943124627/749606_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-25-1671943124627/749606_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-25-1671943124627/749608_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-25-1671943124627/749608_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-25-1671943124627/749611_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-25-1671943124627/749611_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-25-1671943124627/749616_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-25-1671943124627/749616_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-25-1671943124627/749618_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-25-1671943124627/749618_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-25-1671943124627/1999739_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-25-1671943124627/1999739_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-55-639-3000](tel:+82556393000)\n- [üè†tour.geoje.go.kr](http://tour.geoje.go.kr/index.sko)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 34.7373624372\nlongitude: 128.6648928581\ntitle: San 21-19, Galgot-ri, Nambu-myeon, Geoje-si, Gyeongsangnam-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-25-1671943124627","title":"Sinseondae Observatory (Ïã†ÏÑ†ÎåÄ Ï†ÑÎßùÎåÄ)","description":"Sinseondae Observatory, located between Dojangpo Maeul and Haegeumgang, offers picturesque views of the fantastically shaped rocks against the deep-blue ocean hues.

On the hilltops, which were viewed as prime burial places, are the tombs of kings and rulers; on the slopes are the tombs of the lower classes. <br><br>A total of 136 tumuli were found in the Daesong-dong area. Further investigation of the tumuli revealed several important and interesting facts. First, from the end of the third century, men and horses were buried alive along with the dead. Also, weapons were bent and buried as well, with many of these artifacts being unearthed among the tumuli. Other materials found in the tumuli such as cylindrical bronze items, pinwheel-shaped bronze items, and jasper items showed that Gaya was involved in trade with Japan. The Daeseong-dong Tumuli is significant in that it gives a glimpse into the political and social structure of the Gaya Kingdom, and the cultural exchange between Korea, China, and Japan.","regDate":"2022-12-27","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-27-1672119336198"},{"id":"2022-12-27-1672115914882","title":"Yeonhwasan Provincial Park (Ïó∞ÌôîÏÇ∞ÎèÑÎ¶ΩÍ≥µÏõê)","description":"Yeonhwasan Mountain, located in Goseong, Gyeongsangnam-do, is just 524 meters tall, encompasses the three peaks of Ongnyeobong, Seondobong and Mangseonbong, and is widely recognized as an important provincial park.
