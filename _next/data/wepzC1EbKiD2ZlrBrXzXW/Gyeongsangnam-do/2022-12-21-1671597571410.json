On the hilltops, which were viewed as prime burial places, are the tombs of kings and rulers; on the slopes are the tombs of the lower classes. <br><br>A total of 136 tumuli were found in the Daesong-dong area. Further investigation of the tumuli revealed several important and interesting facts. First, from the end of the third century, men and horses were buried alive along with the dead. Also, weapons were bent and buried as well, with many of these artifacts being unearthed among the tumuli. Other materials found in the tumuli such as cylindrical bronze items, pinwheel-shaped bronze items, and jasper items showed that Gaya was involved in trade with Japan. The Daeseong-dong Tumuli is significant in that it gives a glimpse into the political and social structure of the Gaya Kingdom, and the cultural exchange between Korea, China, and Japan.","regDate":"2022-12-27","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-27-1672119336198"},{"id":"2022-12-27-1672115914882","title":"Yeonhwasan Provincial Park (Ïó∞ÌôîÏÇ∞ÎèÑÎ¶ΩÍ≥µÏõê)","description":"Yeonhwasan Mountain, located in Goseong, Gyeongsangnam-do, is just 524 meters tall, encompasses the three peaks of Ongnyeobong, Seondobong and Mangseonbong, and is widely recognized as an important provincial park.
