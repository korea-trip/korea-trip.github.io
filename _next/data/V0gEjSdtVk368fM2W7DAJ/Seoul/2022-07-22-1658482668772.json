The traces of the past still remain on Dongnimmun with two pillars in front of Dongnimmun&nbsp;being the remains of Yeongeunmun. <br> <br> The Arc de Triomphe in France can be recalled in comparison to Dongnimmun. Dongnimmun was built using granite with&nbsp;a passageway x_height of 14.28 meters.  On the top it is written ‘Dongnimmun’ in Korean with the national flag drawn on each side.  On the inner-left side there are stone stairs leading to the attic.  The national flower Mugunghwa are planted around Dongnimmun. Now it is surrounded by roads and it is eye-catching to view when passing by.","regDate":"2022-07-22","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Gates"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-22-1658500616152/2413929_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-07-22-1658500616152"},{"id":"2022-07-22-1658497928569","title":"Dongdaemun History & Culture Park (동대문역사문화공원)","description":"At Dongdaemun History & Culture Park, traditional buildings and cutting-edge modern cultural facilities come together harmoniously.
