It was built to repel attacks from the Mongols.  The inner castle was destroyed when the capital was moved to another place, and at the beginning of the Joseon Era (1392-1910) the wall was again rebuilt with mud. <br> <br>It went through much restoration until finally being rebuilt with stones. Ganghwasanseong Fortress originally had interior and exterior walls, but only the interior wall remains today.  It has an approximate circumference of 1.2km.  The exterior mud wall was approximately 9km in circumference with 8 gates.  The huge exterior wall was built along the side of the east channel of Ganghwa, but no longer exists today.  From 1977, the interior wall has been rebuilt many times over, but the east side of this wall has yet to be reconstructed.  <br><br>There were four main gates in the wall.  To the south, Anparu; to the east, Cheomhwaru; to the west, Manghanru; and to the north, Jinsongru. At the west gate, the historic Yeonmudang still remains.  This area was where the soldiers used to train, and was also the place where the Korea-Japan Treaty of Peace and Amity (or Treaty of Ganghwa Island) was signed in 1876.  <br><br>With its aching history left behind and beautiful scenery, Ganghwasanseong Fortress serves as an ideal place for a brisk walk or refreshing drive.","regDate":"2022-08-10","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Fortresses"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-10-1660167456204/1579234_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-08-10-1660167456204"},{"id":"2022-08-10-1660163962726","title":"Ganghwahyanggyo Confucian School (Í∞ïÌôîÌñ•Íµê)","description":"First established in Ganghwa-eup during the 5th year of King Injong in  the Goryeo dynasty (1127), Ganghwahyanggyo Confucian School was moved to Ganghwa-gun and then restored  at the foot of Buksan Mountain (formally Songaksan Mountain) in 1624 by Sim Yeol during the 2nd year of King Injo. <br><br>Ganghwahyanggyo Confucian School is regarded as an important cultural and historical site in Ganghwa-eup.","regDate":"2022-08-10","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-10-1660163962726/1575654_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-08-10-1660163962726"},{"id":"2022-08-10-1660160108986","title":"Ganghwado Jejeokbong Peace Observatory (Í∞ïÌôîÎèÑÏ†úÏ†ÅÎ¥â ÌèâÌôîÏ†ÑÎßùÎåÄ )","description":"Ganghwado Jejeokbong Peace Observatory was constructed in the northern area of the Civilian Restricted Zone in Cheolsan-ri, Yangsa-myeon.

The island is home to Chamseongdan Altar on top of Manisan Mountain on the southern coast. This said to be where Dangun Wanggeom offered sacrificial rites to the heavens.

Seonwonsa Temple was built by General Choi Wu in 1245 (the 32nd year of King Gojong‚Äôs reign during the Goryeo dynasty), which was right after the transfer of the capital to Ganghwado during resistance against the Mongolian invasion. <br><br>The temple was meant to be a spiritual mainstay in fighting against Mongolia. It used to be one of the two largest temples in Korea along with Songgwangsa Temple. However, the temple was completely destroyed during the early Joseon era, leaving only the site itself. The famous wood blocks of Palman Daejanggyeong (the Tripitaka Koreana), currently housed in Haeinsa Temple at Hapcheon, are said to have been originally stored in Seonwonsa Temple. It is believed that the carved wood blocks were taken from Seonwonsa to Heungcheonsa Temple during the Joseon era and again moved to Haeinsa Temple during the reign of Sejo. <br><br>Located on a mountain slope, the presumed location of the building site extends 250 meters from south to north and 170 meters from east to west.","regDate":"2022-08-10","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-10-1660153342135/1577247_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-08-10-1660153342135"},{"id":"2022-08-10-1660150781902","title":"Ganghwa Seoksumun Gate (Í∞ïÌôî ÏÑùÏàòÎ¨∏)","description":"Seoksumun is a floodgate on the Dongnakcheon Stream, which flows through the town of Ganghwa-eup.
