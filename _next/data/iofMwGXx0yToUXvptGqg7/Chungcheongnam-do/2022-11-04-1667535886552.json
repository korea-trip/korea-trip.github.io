Originally, the temple was called Samseonam, or Three Hermitages, for there had been three hermitages in the upper, middle, and lower part of Buchunsan Mountain. During the late Joseon dynasty, the hermitages in the upper and middle part were closed and only the one at the bottom survived.

The third peak is the highest, standing at 362 meters with a beautiful view and crisp air, making it ideal for hiking (3-hour course) and resting at the top. There is another mountain of the same name in Hongcheon, so this mountain is usually referred to as “Seosan Palbongsan.”","regDate":"2022-11-14","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongnam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-14-1668404666423/1919432_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Chungcheongnam-do/2022-11-14-1668404666423"},{"id":"2022-11-14-1668401983817","title":"Seosan Munsusa Temple (문수사(서산))","description":"The exact founding date of Munsusa Temple is unknown because there are no official records that have been discovered.

Around 600 items were discovered along with the prayer, including unbleached ramie cloth, a short-sleeved gown, rice, and barley. Munsunsa has the tranquil atmosphere of a mountain temple. When spring arrives, cherry blossom flowers and wild flowers bloom across the mountain and the nearby cattle farm call to mind a traditional Korean painting.<br><br>Munsusa Temples Geungnaksiljeon Hall is a beautiful building constructed in the Jusimpo style (the column brackets placed only on top of the columns) combined with Dapo style (the column brackets placed between columns as well as on top of the columns).
