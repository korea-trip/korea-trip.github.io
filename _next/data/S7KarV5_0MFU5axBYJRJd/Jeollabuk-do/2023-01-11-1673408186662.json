The strangely-shaped rocks and thick groves of trees that border the cascading falls make for such a magical scene that it comes as no surprise that the waterfall has long since been counted as one of the Eight Scenic Sights of Wansan. Attractions located nearby include a battlefield from the Imjin War (1592-1598), Songgwangsa Temple, Dongsang Reservoir, Daea Reservoir, and Hwasim Hot Springs.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-63-290-3930|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-11-1673408186662/215199_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-11-1673408186662/215199_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-11-1673408186662/492644_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-11-1673408186662/492644_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-11-1673408186662/492645_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-11-1673408186662/492645_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-11-1673408186662/492649_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-11-1673408186662/492649_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-11-1673408186662/1605117_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-11-1673408186662/1605117_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-11-1673408186662/1605119_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-11-1673408186662/1605119_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-11-1673408186662/1605120_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-11-1673408186662/1605120_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-11-1673408186662/1605121_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-11-1673408186662/1605121_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-11-1673408186662/1605123_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-11-1673408186662/1605123_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-63-290-3930](tel:+82632903930)\n- [üè†www.wanju.go.kr](http://www.wanju.go.kr/tour/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.9097387398\nlongitude: 127.2614908428\ntitle: Daeheung-ri, Wanju-gun, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Jeonju, take Bus No. 806 and get off at Wibongpokpo Falls Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-11-1673408186662","title":"Wibongpokpo Falls (ÏúÑÎ¥âÌè≠Ìè¨)","description":"Located in the eastern section of Wibongsanseong Fortress, Wibongpokpo Falls is a two-tiered waterfall measuring 60 meters high.
