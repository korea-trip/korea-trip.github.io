The temple is widely believed to have been established by the great monk Uisang Daesa during the 16th year of King Munmu (676).

On the temple grounds are a 3-story stone pagoda and some stone sculptures including seoksu (animal statues) and budo (a stupa in honor of a great master). Inside the temple are Daejeokgwangjeon Hall (Treasure No.826), Myeongbujeon Hall, and Gongyangjib Chamber (a chamber for Buddhist offerings).\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-63-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-63-548-0917|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Not available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-02-1672630555982/176743_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-02-1672630555982/176743_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-02-1672630555982/176744_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-02-1672630555982/176744_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-02-1672630555982/612500_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-02-1672630555982/612500_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-02-1672630555982/196929_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-02-1672630555982/196929_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-63-548-0917](tel:+82635480917)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.7453148338\nlongitude: 127.0470225669\ntitle: 40, Cheongdo 6-gil, Gimje-si, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>\nFrom Jeonju Intercity/Express Bus Terminal, take Bus No. 79 and get off at Cheongdo-ri Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-02-1672630555982","title":"Gwisinsa Temple - Gimje (귀신사 - 김제)","description":"Gwisinsa, located in Cheongdo Village, Geumsan-myeon, Gimje-si, is now a temple of the Jogye Order, but once belonged to the Haweom Order.
