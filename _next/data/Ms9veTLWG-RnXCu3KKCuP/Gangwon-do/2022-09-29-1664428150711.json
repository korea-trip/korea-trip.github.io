This private forest was planted and has been maintained by one man for over 30 years. He settled down in the area in 1985 with his wife who suffered from chronic indigestion. He started planting the ginkgo tree seedlings on his spacious field after he heard about the medicinal effects of the mineral waters from Sambong Springwater at the foot of Odaesan Mountain. The forest remained private until 2010, when its popularity spread by word of mouth. Since then, the owner has graciously agreed to open his private land up to the public for free during the month of October, when the whole forest takes on a golden hue.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-33-430-4505|\n|parking:|Not available|\n|usetime:|Open every October (10:00-17:00)|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-09-29-1664428150711/1850329_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-29-1664428150711/1850329_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-29-1664428150711/1850334_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-29-1664428150711/1850334_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-29-1664428150711/1852401_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-29-1664428150711/1852401_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-29-1664428150711/1852413_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-29-1664428150711/1852413_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-29-1664428150711/1852415_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-29-1664428150711/1852415_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-29-1664428150711/1852418_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-29-1664428150711/1852418_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-29-1664428150711/1852423_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-29-1664428150711/1852423_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-29-1664428150711/1852434_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-29-1664428150711/1852434_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-29-1664428150711/1852437_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-29-1664428150711/1852437_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-29-1664428150711/1850319_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-29-1664428150711/1850319_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-33-430-4505](tel:+82334304505)\n- [üè†www.hongcheon.go.kr](https://www.hongcheon.go.kr/tour/selectTourCntntsWebView.do?tourNo=2125&pageUnit=6&pageIndex=1&searchCnd=all&key=2038&ctgry=9&searchShowAt=Y)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.8321872306\nlongitude: 128.4707332608\ntitle: 686-4, Gwangwon-ri, Hongcheon-gun, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-09-29-1664428150711","title":"Hongcheon Ginkgo Forest (ÌôçÏ≤ú ÏùÄÌñâÎÇòÎ¨¥Ïà≤)","description":"Hongcheon Ginkgo Forest is only open to the public during the month of October.
