According to the Samguk Sagi (history of the three kingdoms), Byeokgolje was first built in the 21st year of the reign of King Heulhae (AD 330) of the Silla Kingdom. However, this region belonged to the Baekje kingdom at that time, so some counter that the embankment was actually built in the 27th year of King Biryou (AD 330) of the Baekje kingdom. Historians agree, however, that the reservoir was mended by King Wonseong of Silla in AD 790 and by King Hyeonjong and King Injong of the Goryeo Dynasty in AD 1143. In 1415, King Taejong of the Joseon dynasty rebuilt the whole facility, but it was washed away in heavy rains five years later in the 2nd year of King Sejong.  <br><br>\n\nOnly about three kilometers of the reservoir embankment remain intact today. Moreover, the original embankment underwent major transformations in 1925 when the Dongjin Land Improvement Association remolded it into a channel for carrying water to nearby fields. <br><br>In 1975, an archeological study of the sites where the two floodgates once stood revealed that highly refined measuring techniques had been used in the original construction of the reservoir. Thus, despite its many changes, Byeokgolje not only holds significance as Korea‚Äôs oldest manmade reservoir, but also as a historical relic that points to the highly developed engineering technology of the past.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-63-540-4094|\n|parking:|1,700 parking spaces|\n|usetime:|March-October 09:00-18:00 / November-February 09:00-17:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-01-1659337204897/1603973_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659337204897/1603973_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659337204897/1603975_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659337204897/1603975_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659337204897/1603976_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659337204897/1603976_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-63-540-4094](tel:+82635404094)\n- [üè†www.gimje.go.kr](http://www.gimje.go.kr/tour/index.gimje)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.7539160928\nlongitude: 126.8538534326\ntitle: 442, Byeokgolje-ro, Buryang-myeon, Gimje-si, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Gimje Bus Terminal, take Bus No. 11 or  13.<br>\nGet off at Pogyo Station and walk straight for approx. 285 m.\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-01-1659337204897","title":"Gimje Byeokgolje Reservoir (ÍπÄÏ†ú Î≤ΩÍ≥®Ï†ú)","description":"The Byeokgolje Reservoir in Gimje is the oldest irrigation facility in Korea.

The length of each course varies from 1.5 to 14 kilometers. For those who are not able to trek long distances, walking the 3.6 kilometer-long nature trail that leads to the flatland is a good option.

The land was purchased by French Priest Baudenet in 1891 (28th year of King Gojong), but construction of the church did not begin until 1908. The church was designed by Priest Poinel, who also designed the famous Myeongdong Cathedral in Seoul. Construction was completed in 1914, a time during which Korea was under Japanese rule. Though originally built just outside of Pungnammun Gate, the site of the martyrs, the church was later moved to its current location for expansion.  <br><br>The first Romanesque building in the Honam region, Jeondong Catholic Cathedral is made of gray and red bricks and bears a striking resemblance to the Myeongdong Cathedral in Seoul. Not only considered one of the most beautiful Catholic churches in Korea, some even go so far as to say it is one of the most beautiful structures in all of Korea, citing the church‚Äôs unique combination of Byzantine and Romanesque architectural styles. The rectangular building is topped with three Byzantine bell towers (to the right, center, and left) and boasts arched ceilings, several of which meet in the form of a cross. <br><br>It is interesting to note that some of the bricks used in construction of the church were made using materials from the Jeonjueupseong Walled Town, which was torn down by the Japanese. It is also said that the cornerstone of the church came from a wall of Jeonjueupseong Walled Town near Pungnammun Gate.","regDate":"2023-01-04","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Holy Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-04-1672810566980/2641989_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-04-1672810566980"},{"id":"2023-01-04-1672807110323","title":"Jeoksangsanseong Fortress (Î¨¥Ï£º Ï†ÅÏÉÅÏÇ∞ÏÑ±)","description":"Jeoksangsan Mountain (elevation 1,034m) in Muju, Jeollabuk-do, is surrounded by precipitous walls of stratified rocks.
