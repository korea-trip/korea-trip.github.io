Hwanung attended to their plea by instructing them to avoid sunlight for 100 days and live only by consuming garlic and mugwort. Unlike the tiger who gave up, the bear followed the instructions faithfully and transformed into a woman, who then married Hwanung and gave birth to Dangun.<br><br> Located near Yeonguncheonbyeon in Gokseong-eup, Dangunjeon Shrine was first founded in Hakjeong-ri, Samin-dong in 1916 by Shin Tae-yun, also known as Baekdang, but later moved to its current location and went through reconstruction in 1931. An annual ancestral rite takes place at the shrine on October 3 (National Foundation Day) and March 15 to pay respects to Dangun. Dangunjeon Shrine was also a place where civilians gathered to take an oath of patriotism in action against the Japanese during the Japanese colonization period; a stone plaque commemorating the March 1st Independence Movement and Baekdang Memorial Hall dedicated to Shin Tae-yun can also be found within the area. Shin Tae-yun was captured by Japanese soldiers during the March 1st Independence Movement and served two years in prison.","regDate":"2023-01-20","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollanam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-20-1674196823651/1609432_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollanam-do/2023-01-20-1674196823651"},{"id":"2023-01-20-1674192977194","title":"Geumseongsanseong Fortress (Îã¥Ïñë Í∏àÏÑ±ÏÇ∞ÏÑ±)","description":"Geumseongsanseong Fortress in Geumseongsan Mountain (603m) forms a boundary between two small villages located on the border of two provinces (Geumseong-myeon, Damyang-gun, Jeollanam-do and Sunchang-gun, Jeollabuk-do) and is one of the three popular mountains of the Honam region (the Southwestern region of Korea that includes Jeollanam-do and Jeollabuk-do).
