Most dinosaur tracks found in Korea are located in coastal areas in cities like Haenam and Boseong, so the discovery in the inner region of Jeollanam-do was a first. Most prints here come from carnivorous dinaosaurs of the Cretaceous period. The site is famous for there being tracks from no fewer than five different dinosaurs, as well as for being one of the longest trails and most direct examples of the exact movements of the dinosaurs. The tracks of one dinosaur are the longest in the world, stretching for 40 meters. Based on the foot size of 20-22 centimeters with a stride of approximately 90 centimeters, it is estimated that the prints were formed by a 4-5 meter tall Koolasuchus. In addition to the canivorous dinosaurs, tracks were found of 12 herbivorous dinosaurs, as well as fossilized plants. These plants offer much assistance in the research of herbivorous dinosaur diets.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-61-379-3503|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-17-1673944760289/1608220_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-17-1673944760289/1608220_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-17-1673944760289/1608221_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-17-1673944760289/1608221_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-17-1673944760289/1608222_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-17-1673944760289/1608222_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-17-1673944760289/1608224_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-17-1673944760289/1608224_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.1695863575\nlongitude: 127.0906362225\ntitle: 2080, Baega-ro, Hwasun-gun, Jeollanam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Train]<br>\nFrom Yongsan Station, take a train to Gwangju-Songjeong Station.<br>\nTake the Gwangju Subway to Hwaseong Station.<br> Walk for approx. 1km to Gwangju Bus Terminal and take Nongeochon Bus No. 225 to Jangdan Village Bus Stop. <br>Transfer to Nongeochon Bus No. 217-1 and get off at Seoyu 1(il)-ri Bus Stop.<br> Walk for approx. 500m to the tracksite.\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-17-1673944760289","title":"Dinosaur Tracksite of Hwasun, Seoyu-ri (화순 서유리 공룡발자국화석 산지)","description":"The Dinosaur Tracksite of Hwasun was discovered in 1999 during a land survery for the construction of Hwasun Hot Springs Area.

He is known to be the grandson of the heavens and the son of Hwanung. According to the legend, Hwanung was approached by a bear and a tiger who wished to become human beings. Hwanung attended to their plea by instructing them to avoid sunlight for 100 days and live only by consuming garlic and mugwort. Unlike the tiger who gave up, the bear followed the instructions faithfully and transformed into a woman, who then married Hwanung and gave birth to Dangun.<br><br> Located near Yeonguncheonbyeon in Gokseong-eup, Dangunjeon Shrine was first founded in Hakjeong-ri, Samin-dong in 1916 by Shin Tae-yun, also known as Baekdang, but later moved to its current location and went through reconstruction in 1931. An annual ancestral rite takes place at the shrine on October 3 (National Foundation Day) and March 15 to pay respects to Dangun. Dangunjeon Shrine was also a place where civilians gathered to take an oath of patriotism in action against the Japanese during the Japanese colonization period; a stone plaque commemorating the March 1st Independence Movement and Baekdang Memorial Hall dedicated to Shin Tae-yun can also be found within the area. Shin Tae-yun was captured by Japanese soldiers during the March 1st Independence Movement and served two years in prison.","regDate":"2023-01-20","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollanam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-20-1674196823651/1609432_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollanam-do/2023-01-20-1674196823651"},{"id":"2023-01-20-1674192977194","title":"Geumseongsanseong Fortress (담양 금성산성)","description":"Geumseongsanseong Fortress in Geumseongsan Mountain (603m) forms a boundary between two small villages located on the border of two provinces (Geumseong-myeon, Damyang-gun, Jeollanam-do and Sunchang-gun, Jeollabuk-do) and is one of the three popular mountains of the Honam region (the Southwestern region of Korea that includes Jeollanam-do and Jeollabuk-do).
