In the past, the island was called Ijeokdo Island because it served as a hideout for pirates. The sea, mountain, and shoal exist in harmony.<br>\n<br>\n The beauty of Daeijakdo Island comes from the view of the blue ocean from the peak of Buasan Mountain and the shoal that only appears during low tide. The shoal almost reaches Soijakdo Island and creates a large field of sand. The shoal is also called <em>pulchi</em> and only appears during low tide for six hours a day.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-32-851-888|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-12-1657594780125/2661904_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-12-1657594780125/2661904_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-12-1657594780125/2661906_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-12-1657594780125/2661906_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-12-1657594780125/2661907_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-12-1657594780125/2661907_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-12-1657594780125/2661908_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-12-1657594780125/2661908_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-32-851-888](tel:+8232851888)\n- [üè†daeijakdo.kr](http://daeijakdo.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.1749176125\nlongitude: 126.2587835301\ntitle: Ijak-ri, Ongjin-gun, Incheon\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Ferry]<br>\nTake a ferry from Incheon Passenger Port Terminal to the island.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-12-1657594780125","title":"Daeijakdo Island (ÎåÄÏù¥ÏûëÎèÑ)","description":"Ijakdo Island is made up of Daeijakdo Island and Soijakdo Island.

The street became connected samchi, or grilled seerfish, over 40 years ago with the opening House of Inha, a home-style restaurant. Originally, the street was not known for samchi, but it became one of the most popular menus at the restuarant, with many other shops in the area following in this trend. In 2002, it was designated as the grilled seerfish street and a signboard was put up at the street entrance. Currently, there are about a dozen grilled seerfish restaurants lining the street, and each restaurant has a unique signboard of its own. The fish are imported from New Zealand, and each restaurant offers a distinct taste resulting from different grilling methods and sauces. The restaurants also sell a variety of appetizers and side dishes at affordable prices.","regDate":"2022-07-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Culture/Art/History","Experience Programs","Cultural Districts"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-12-1657605089652/728361_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-07-12-1657605089652"},{"id":"2022-07-12-1657600897567","title":"Dolmen in Bugeun-ri [UNESCO World Heritage] (Í∞ïÌôî Í≥†Ïù∏Îèå Ïú†Ï†Å [Ïú†ÎÑ§Ïä§ÏΩî ÏÑ∏Í≥ÑÎ¨∏ÌôîÏú†ÏÇ∞])","description":"Dolmen in Bugeun-ri is a dolmen site in Ganghwa that is designated as Historic Site No. 137 for its historical value representing the funeral customs of the Bronze Age.
