This fish was related to the family of fish commonly called drums, croakers, or hardheads for the repetitive throbbing or drumming sounds they make. When the economy flourished thanks to profitable fishing, the Socheongdo port was congested with fishing boats, so much that it was said that one could cross from one island to the next by walking over boats. The species of fish is depleted, and the island remains as quiet with views of North Korea.<br><br>\nIn November 2010, Socheongdo Island was hit by the fatal shelling from North Korea that killed two civilians and two soldiers. In recent months, the island has made an attempt to recover its tourism industry and to develop security tourism by blending its newer military presence at tourist attractions.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) • For more info: +82-32-899-3450|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-12-1660340265213/1385402_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-12-1660340265213/1385402_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-12-1660340265213/2496368_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-12-1660340265213/2496368_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-12-1660340265213/2496369_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-12-1660340265213/2496369_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-12-1660340265213/2496384_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-12-1660340265213/2496384_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-12-1660340265213/2496385_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-12-1660340265213/2496385_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-12-1660340265213/2496386_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-12-1660340265213/2496386_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-12-1660340265213/2496388_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-12-1660340265213/2496388_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-12-1660340265213/2496389_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-12-1660340265213/2496389_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-12-1660340265213/1385387_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-12-1660340265213/1385387_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-32-899-3450](tel:+82328993450)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.6649371493\nlongitude: 125.7020074536\ntitle: 3, Yeonpyeongjungang-ro 24beon-gil, Ongjin-gun, Incheon\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Ferry]<BR>\nTake a passenger ferry from Yeonan Port.<BR> \n* Ferry schedule is subject to change, depending on the season and weather conditions.\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-12-1660340265213","title":"Yeonpyeongdo Island (연평도(대/소 연평도))","description":"Yeonpyeongdo Island is a small island resided by fishing communities.

After  a little street started specializing in serving&nbsp;baendaengi some 30 years ago,  the fish&nbsp;has continued to grow in popularity. <br> <br> Located in Guwol-dong, across from the Incheon Culture & Arts Center, Baendaengi  Street has expanded, and so has the variety of dishes served. Visitors can try baendaengi prepared sashimi-style,   roasted, or  in a spicy soup. For this particular species of herring, locals believe the flavor is best in March and April when they grow to their largest size. Salted Baendaengi also makes an excellent side-dish for Korean meals. <br> <br>* Baendaengi is one of many types of small prey fish referred to as ‘Soeo’ for their fierce struggle in fishing nets. Soeo have internal organs that are proportionally smaller than other species of fish and are known for their feisty nature.  These attributes are thought to signify a stress-filled life,  which  is why many Koreans refer to narrow-minded or hot-tempered people as ‘baendaengi.’","regDate":"2022-08-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Culture/Art/History","Experience Programs","Cultural Districts"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-08-13-1660395563205"},{"id":"2022-08-13-1660390528798","title":"Hanagae Beach (하나개해수욕장)","description":"Hanagae Beach, the biggest tideland on Muuido Island, features a one-kilometer-long beach covered by fine, powder-like sands.

During the Byeonginyangyo (the French invasion in 1866), the French fleet stayed in Ganghwado for about a month until they withdrew their forces after losing during the Jeongjoksanseong Battle. During the Sinmiyangyo (the United States expedition to Korea in 1981), the American fleet attacked Chojijin Fortress, Deokjinjin Fortress and Gwangseongbo Fortress. Hence, Ganghwado played a big part in South Korea opening its doors to the West in the 19th century. Ganghwado also became the Western Christian missionaries' center of activity for their missionary works.<br><br>There are three remaining churches that were built in that time that were  influenced or built by the Western Christian Missionaries  Ganghwa Anglican Church established in 1900, Ganghwa St. Andrew's Church established in 1906, and Ganghwa Seodo Central Church established in 1923. <br><br>Ganghwa Seodo Central Church started contruction in February 1923 and was completed as a Korean-architecture chapel in July 1923. The original name was Jumun Church and it was renamed as Seodo Central (Jungang) Church in 1978. The church belongs to The Korean Methodist Church.<br><br>Even though the building of the church doesn't reflect outstanding building techniques and aesthetic qualities, a Western church with a Korean-style wooden structure such as Ganghwa Seodo Central Church is still worth a visit.","regDate":"2022-08-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Holy Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-08-13-1660387217022"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
