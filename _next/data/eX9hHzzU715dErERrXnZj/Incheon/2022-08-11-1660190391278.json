Legend has it that in the year 416 (during the reign of King Jangsu of Goguryeo), a Buddhist monk named Cheonchukguk climbed Goryeosan Mountain and found Oryeonji Pond where the five-colored lotus flowers bloomed. The monk picked the lotus flower petals and blew them into the air. He then built a temple where each of the petals had landed, naming the temples according to their corresponding color: Jeokseoksa Temple, formerly Jeokryeonsa Temple (red lotus), Baengnyeonsa Temple (white lotus), Cheongryeonsa Temple (blue lotus), Hwangryeonsa Temple (yellow lotus), and Heungnyeonsa Temple (black lotus). \n<br><br>\nAround 130 dolmens are distributed along the foot of Goryeosan Mountain. Sirumisan Mountain, on the northern side of Goryeosan Mountain is said to have been the birthplace of General Yeongaesomun of the Goguryeo Kingdom.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-32-930-3515|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Hiking Course:|[Course 1] Baengnyeonsa Temple - Azalea field (3.7 km / Approx. 1 hr 20 min) <br /><br />[Course 2] Cheongnyeonsa Temple- Azalea field (2.9 km / Approx. 1 hr) <br /><br />[Course 3] Gobigogae Pass - Azalea field (2.4 km / Approx. 1 hr) <br /><br />[Course 4] Jeokseoksa Temple - Azalea field (5.2 km / Approx. 1 hr 50 min)<br /><br />[Course 5] Mikkujigogae Pass - Azalea field (5.8 km / Approx. 2 hr)|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2376706_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2376706_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2376708_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2376708_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2648946_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2648946_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2648947_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2648947_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2648948_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2648948_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2648949_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2648949_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2648950_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2648950_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2648951_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2648951_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2648952_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2648952_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2376705_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2376705_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-32-930-3515](tel:+82329303515)\n- [üè†www.ganghwa.go.kr](http://www.ganghwa.go.kr/open_content/tour)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.7407298666\nlongitude: 126.4352713405\ntitle: Gocheon-ri, Ganghwa-gun, Incheon\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus + Subway]<BR>\nSinchon Station (Seoul Subway Line 2), Exit 4.<br>Go straight 260m to arrive at the bus stop in front of Artreon.<br>From the bus stop, take Bus 3000 to Ganghwa Bus Terminal. <BR>From Ganghwa Bus Terminal, take Bus No. 1, 23, 25, 27, 30, 32 or 35 and get off at Dolmen Square Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-11-1660190391278","title":"Goryeosan Mountain (Í≥†Î†§ÏÇ∞)","description":"Goryeosan Mountain, once referred to as Oryeonsan, is a mountain rich in folklore.

While the water is cool and sweet, legend has it that it dries up or turns murky in times of national crisis.

Visitors can try baendaengi prepared sashimi-style,   roasted, or  in a spicy soup. For this particular species of herring, locals believe the flavor is best in March and April when they grow to their largest size. Salted Baendaengi also makes an excellent side-dish for Korean meals. <br> <br>* Baendaengi is one of many types of small prey fish referred to as ‚ÄòSoeo‚Äô for their fierce struggle in fishing nets. Soeo have internal organs that are proportionally smaller than other species of fish and are known for their feisty nature.

During the Byeonginyangyo (the French invasion in 1866), the French fleet stayed in Ganghwado for about a month until they withdrew their forces after losing during the Jeongjoksanseong Battle. During the Sinmiyangyo (the United States expedition to Korea in 1981), the American fleet attacked Chojijin Fortress, Deokjinjin Fortress and Gwangseongbo Fortress. Hence, Ganghwado played a big part in South Korea opening its doors to the West in the 19th century. Ganghwado also became the Western Christian missionaries' center of activity for their missionary works.<br><br>There are three remaining churches that were built in that time that were  influenced or built by the Western Christian Missionaries  Ganghwa Anglican Church established in 1900, Ganghwa St. Andrew's Church established in 1906, and Ganghwa Seodo Central Church established in 1923. <br><br>Ganghwa Seodo Central Church started contruction in February 1923 and was completed as a Korean-architecture chapel in July 1923. The original name was Jumun Church and it was renamed as Seodo Central (Jungang) Church in 1978. The church belongs to The Korean Methodist Church.<br><br>Even though the building of the church doesn't reflect outstanding building techniques and aesthetic qualities, a Western church with a Korean-style wooden structure such as Ganghwa Seodo Central Church is still worth a visit.","regDate":"2022-08-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Holy Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-08-13-1660387217022"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
