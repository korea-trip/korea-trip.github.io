The chief of Ganghwa County, Jeong Gi-se, enlarged the original residence and named it Yongheunggung (meaning palace of the rising dragon) in the 4th year of King Cheoljong‚Äôs reign. Its architectural features include a paljak (traditional Korean half-hipped roof) and supporting columns  rendered in Jusimpo style, the column brackets  placed only on top of the columns. The palace was built in the tradition of dwelling houses such as the Yeongyeongdang and Nakseonjae houses in Changdeokgung Palace, so the palace buildings give off a simple and plain atmosphere. Within the precincts of the palace are a memorial stone and a monument house indicating that the palace used to be the old home of King Cheoljong.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-32-930-3515, <BR>+82-32-392-5464|\n|parking:|Nearby parking lot in Goryeogung Palace Site (5-minute walk)|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-12-1660343994183/1575637_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-12-1660343994183/1575637_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-12-1660343994183/1575641_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-12-1660343994183/1575641_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-12-1660343994183/2512798_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-12-1660343994183/2512798_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-12-1660343994183/2512799_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-12-1660343994183/2512799_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-12-1660343994183/2512800_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-12-1660343994183/2512800_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-12-1660343994183/2512805_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-12-1660343994183/2512805_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-12-1660343994183/2512806_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-12-1660343994183/2512806_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-12-1660343994183/2512807_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-12-1660343994183/2512807_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-12-1660343994183/2512808_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-12-1660343994183/2512808_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-12-1660343994183/1575642_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-12-1660343994183/1575642_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-32-930-3515](tel:+82329303515)\n- [üè†www.ganghwa.go.kr</a><br><a href=\"http://www.cha.go.kr/\" target=\"_blank\">www.cha.go.kr](http://www.ganghwa.go.kr/open_content/tour)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.7479493616\nlongitude: 126.4859998213\ntitle: 16-1, Dongmunan-gil 21beon-gil, Ganghwa-gun, Incheon\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-12-1660343994183","title":"Yongheunggung Palace (Ïö©Ìù•Í∂Å)","description":"Yongheunggung Palace is where King Cheoljong (r. 1849-1863) used to live before his ascension to throne.

During the Byeonginyangyo (the French invasion in 1866), the French fleet stayed in Ganghwado for about a month until they withdrew their forces after losing during the Jeongjoksanseong Battle. During the Sinmiyangyo (the United States expedition to Korea in 1981), the American fleet attacked Chojijin Fortress, Deokjinjin Fortress and Gwangseongbo Fortress. Hence, Ganghwado played a big part in South Korea opening its doors to the West in the 19th century. Ganghwado also became the Western Christian missionaries' center of activity for their missionary works.<br><br>There are three remaining churches that were built in that time that were  influenced or built by the Western Christian Missionaries  Ganghwa Anglican Church established in 1900, Ganghwa St. Andrew's Church established in 1906, and Ganghwa Seodo Central Church established in 1923. <br><br>Ganghwa Seodo Central Church started contruction in February 1923 and was completed as a Korean-architecture chapel in July 1923.
