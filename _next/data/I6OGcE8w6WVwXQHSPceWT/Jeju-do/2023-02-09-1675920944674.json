The road from Sanbanggulsa Temple in Southern Jeju to Songaksan Mountain is a famous coastal drive with breathtaking scenic views. Though not as enormous as Hallasan Mountain, the view from the peak of Songaksan is truly scenic. From the summit, one can see nearby islands such as Marado, Gapado, and Hyeongjeseom, and as far as Hallasan Mountain and the Pacific Ocean. <br><br> The main peak rises 104 meters above sea level. To the northwest of the main peak is an expansive prairie with several peaks. There is a crater about 500 meters in diameter and 80 meters in depth, with some blackish volcanic ash still remaining inside. Looking along the jagged coastline, one can spot the large man-made caves built during the Japanese occupation. The seashore at the base of Songaksan Mountain is a famous fishing ground and diverse fish such as sawedged perch and black porgy are caught here.","regDate":"2023-02-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-13-1676277674763/1620230_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-13-1676277674763"},{"id":"2023-02-13-1676273756670","title":"Someorioreum Volcanic Cone (Udobong Peak) (Ïá†Î®∏Î¶¨Ïò§Î¶Ñ(Ïö∞ÎèÑÎ¥â))","description":"Someorioreum Volcanic Cone is located on Udo Island, about 3.8 kilometers from Seongsanhang Port.

Soe means an ox, so means a pool of water and kkak means the end. This is the mouth of the Hyodoncheon Stream. As the fresh water meets the ocean, it broadens into wide, slow-flowing river. Soesokkak Estuary is lined with cliffs of curious lava formations, which are overhung with pine trees. <br>It was chosen as one of hidden picturesque scenery in Chilsip-ri, Seogwi-po, comprised of deep blue ocean, uniquely-shaped rocks formed by lava and a pine forest.<br>Soesokkak Estuary is located in Hahyo-dong on the southern side of Hallasan Mountain. The area is also well-known for its tangerines, and visitors are drawn to the area by the fresh citrus scent.

Thanks to its quiet atmosphere, the beach gives visitors a calmer, more secluded beach experience than some of the larger beaches on Jeju. <br /><br />The 80-meter-wide, crescent-shaped beach stretches for a total length of 300 meters. Bordered by waters that are only an average of one meter deep, the beach gently slopes at a five degree angle.
