It was built on the site of an old fortress in Myeonghwalsan Mountain in the east of Gyeongju in accordance with the Gyeongju Bomun Tourist Resort development plan. There are many leisure facilities and parks around the lake, including an international hotel and Gyeongju World. Bomunho Lake is very popular among bikers and walkers. <br /><br />Unlike other cities or towns where cherry trees are only found in certain areas, Gyeongju is packed with cherry blossoms. In spring, the whole cityscape turns pink with the beautiful blossoms. The combination of the stunning trees reflected in the waters of Bomunho Lake and the trees of Bulguksa Park gracefully adorning the nearby temple make for particularly stunning sights. When a light breeze blows, cherry blossoms gently flutter down like satin snow flakes. The Gyeongju Cherry Blossom Marathon is held in April when the cherry blossoms are in full bloom.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info:  +82-54-745-7601|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-29-1659080270985/1200679_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659080270985/1200679_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659080270985/1200683_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659080270985/1200683_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659080270985/179658_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659080270985/179658_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659080270985/2367728_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659080270985/2367728_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659080270985/2367729_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659080270985/2367729_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659080270985/2367730_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659080270985/2367730_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-54-745-7601](tel:+82547457601)\n- [üè†gyeongju.go.kr/tour](http://gyeongju.go.kr/tour)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.8443272826\nlongitude: 129.2766813295\ntitle: 424-33, Bomun-ro, Gyeongju-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-29-1659080270985","title":"Bomunho Lake (Î≥¥Î¨∏Ìò∏)","description":"Bomunho Lake is a man-made lake 1,652,900 m&sup2; in size.
