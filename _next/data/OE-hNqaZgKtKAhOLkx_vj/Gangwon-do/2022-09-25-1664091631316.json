{"pageProps":{"content":"![Guryongsa Temple (Íµ¨Î£°ÏÇ¨)](/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2391453_image2_1.webp)\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> Guryongsa Temple is located 6 kilometers from Birobong Peak on Chiaksan Mountain, in the direction of Hakkok-ri. It was believed that Monk Uisang (625-702) of the Silla Kingdom (57 BC - AD 935) built and named the temple Guryongsa in 668 during the reign of King Munmu. However, it is now known that the temple was built after King Sukjong, the 19th King of the Joseon dynasty (1392-1910), who reigned from 1674 to 1720, because of the architectural style of Daeungjeon Hall. There is a legend that the Guryongsa Temple site was originally a lake where nine dragons lived. The name Guryong comes from the story that the lake was filled up to build the temple on it. There are many buildings such as Daeungjeon Hall, Bogwangnu Pavilion, Samseonggak Pavilion, Simgeomdang Hall and Seolseondang Hall. Daeungjeon Hall has maintained its original shape though it was repaired many times.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-33-732-4800|\n|parking:|Available (Chiaksan National Park)|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Sunrise - Sunset|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Hiking Course:|* Guryongsa Temple - Seryeompokpo Falls - Birobong Peak - Guryongsa Temple (10.9 km / 6 hr)<br>* Guryongsa Temple - Seryeompokpo Falls - Birobong Peak - Godeunchi - Bugok-ri (15.8 km / 8 hr)<br>* Hwanggol Cave - Ipseoksa Temple - Birobong Peak - Seryeompokpo Falls - Guryongsa Temple (10.7 km / 5 hr)<br>* Hanggu-dong - Gukhyangsa Temple - Hyangnobong Peak - Seryeompokpo Falls - Guryongsa Temple (14.2 km / 7 hr)<br>* Geumdae-ri - Yeongwonsa Temple - Namdaebong Peak - Birobong Peak - Seryeompokpo Falls - Guryongsa Temple (22.6 km / 12 hr)<br>* Seongnam-ri - Sangwonsa Temple - Namdaebong Peak - Birobong Peak - Seryeompokpo Falls - Guryongsa Temple (23.8 km / 13 hr)|\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 2,500 won / Teenagers 800 won / Children 500 won<br>Groups - Adults 2,300 won / Teenagers 700 won / Children 400 won<br><br>* Groups: 30 people or more|\n|Parking Fees:|Compact vehicles: First hour 500 won / each additional 10 min 100 won / Max. daily fee 5,000 won / Monthly pass 50,000 won<br>Small & Mid-sized vehicles: First hour 1,100 won / each additional 10 min 250 won (peak season 300 won) / Max. daily fee 13,000 won / Monthly pass 150,000 won<br>Large vehicles: First hour 2,000 won / each additional 10 min 400 won (peak season 500 won) / Max. daily fee 20,000 won / Monthly pass 200,000 won|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2391440_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2391440_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2391442_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2391442_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2391445_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2391445_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2391446_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2391446_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2391447_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2391447_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2391448_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2391448_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2648995_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2648995_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2648997_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2648997_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2648998_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2648998_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2391441_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2391441_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-33-732-4800](tel:+82337324800)\n- [üè†www.templestay.com](https://www.templestay.com/temple_info.asp?t_id=guryongsa )\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.3995043418\nlongitude: 128.0498675732\ntitle: 500, Guryongsa-ro, Wonju-si, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Train + Bus]<br>\nFrom Cheongnyangni Station, take a train to Wonju Station.<br>\nFrom Wonju Station, take Bus No. 41 and get off at Guryongsa Temple Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-09-25-1664091631316","title":"Guryongsa Temple (Íµ¨Î£°ÏÇ¨)","description":"Guryongsa Temple is located 6 kilometers from Birobong Peak on Chiaksan Mountain, in the direction of Hakkok-ri.

When Taejo of Goryeo was surrounded by the army of Gyeon Hwon (founder of Later Baekje) at the Palgongsan Battle in Daegu, Sin exchanged armor with Taejo‚Äôs armor to disguise himself as the king and died. The enemy thought that he was Taejo and beheaded him, and Taejo made his head with gold in sorrow and held a funeral for him. The Tomb of Sin Sung-gyeom consists of three mounds, which are said to have been a measure that Taejo took lest the golden head should be stolen. The location of the tomb is regarded as one of the best propitious sites for a grave in Korea, based on geomancy. Surrounded by pine trees, this site overlooks downtown Chuncheon. The tombstone, shrine, and memorial stone were built around the tomb.

It was first established at the site of Kensington Hotel, but after being destroyed by fire several times, it was rebuilt at the present position during the reign of King Injo of the Joseon dynasty. According to a legend, Monks Yeongseo, Hyewon, and Yeonok all had envisioned the location in their dreams in which a white-haired heavenly man appeared and indicated them the place of the temple. Thus, the temple was re-constructed at the current location and renamed as ‚ÄúSinheungsa,‚Äù meaning ‚Äúthe temple was blessed by God (sin) and became prosper (heung). However, the Chinese character sin of the temple‚Äôs name was changed in 1995 from sin meaning god to sin meaning ‚Äúnew,‚Äù wishing that the temple will revive Buddhism again in the Yeongdong area (eastern part of the Taebaek Mountain Range). Sinheungsa Temple is home to many cultural heritages including the Geungnakbojeon Hall at Sinheungsa Temple (Treasure) and the Three-story Stone Pagoda at Hyangseongsa Temple Site (Treasure), which is standing on the opposite side of Kensington Star Hotel .

It has been also registered in the IUCN Green List of Protected and Conserved Areas, which is the global standard of best practice for area-based conservation. Having Daecheongbong Peak as the mountains main peak, Seoraksan National Park, with a total area of 398 km¬≤, is divided  into the outer section (Oeseorak, eastern section), the inner section (Naeseorak, western section), and the southern section (Namseorak). Daecheongbong Peak (1,708 m) is the third highest peak in Korea after Hallasan Mountain and Jirisan Mountain, and as the peak is covered with snow for five to six months of the year, the mountain got the name Seorak (meaning a snowy peak). The summit of Daecheongbong Peak commands the magnificent natural landscape of Seoraksan Mountain and the East Sea. In particular, it is known for the fantastic views of the sunrise and sunset. In addition to Daecheongbong Peak, Seoraksan Mountain has some 30 grand peaks, such as Socheongbong, Hwachaebong, and Jungcheongbong. The mountain is also full of hidden scenic views of Biryongpokpo Falls, Ulsan Peak, Heundeulbawi Rock, and Geumganggul Cave.

It is also the origin of most of Seoraksan Mountain‚Äôs famous valleys, like Cheonbuldong and Gayadong Valleys. Because of erratic weather and low temperature, Daecheongbong Peak is often covered in snow from late October to late spring. Its ridges are populated by Siberian dwarf pine, Hairy Korean rhododendron, Ermans birch, and subalpine trees, making it a valuable source for alpine plant research. Four trails in the Seoraksan National Park take the visitors to this peak, through Osaek, Baekdam, Seorak-dong, and Osaengnyeong (Hangyeryeong) Pass. The shortest trail is the 5 km-long Osaek Trail (Osaek ‚Äì Seorak Falls ‚Äì Daecheongbong Peak), taking about 4 hr in total.
