Because it initially laid next to spring water as clean and cold as a morning dew, the temple was also called Gamrosa, meaning Sweet Dew Temple. The spring water was rumored to clean one‚Äôs body and soul, leading to crowd of Buddhist monks to visit the temple. During King Chungryeol‚Äôs reign, the temple was named the Best Temple in the south.<br><br>The temple was burned down during the Imjin War (1592-1598) and then later rebuilt and renamed Cheoneunsa.
