Cheoneunsa Temple is believed to have been built by Monk Deokun and Monk Seru from India in AD 828 during the 3rd year of King Heungdeok. Because it initially laid next to spring water as clean and cold as a morning dew, the temple was also called Gamrosa, meaning Sweet Dew Temple. The spring water was rumored to clean one‚Äôs body and soul, leading to crowd of Buddhist monks to visit the temple. During King Chungryeol‚Äôs reign, the temple was named the Best Temple in the south.<br><br>The temple was burned down during the Imjin War (1592-1598) and then later rebuilt and renamed Cheoneunsa. Legend has it that while the temple was being rebuilt, a large serpent often came out of the spring. When the serpent was finally captured and killed, the spring waters suddenly dried up. Hence the name Cheoneunsa, meaning Disappearance of Spring Water, was given.","regDate":"2023-02-04","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollanam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Jeollanam-do/2023-02-04-1675481763666"},{"id":"2023-02-03-1675420625446","title":"Geomundo Island (Í±∞Î¨∏ÎèÑ)","description":"Located approximately halfway between Yeosu and Jeju Island, Geomundo Island is part of the Dadohae Maritime National Park.
