Palgongsan Mountain is located 20 kilometers northeast from downtown Daegu, where Nakdonggang River and Geumhogang River meet. The mountain has three peaks in a row: Birobong Peak in the center and Dongbong Peak (aka Mitabong, 1,155 m) and Seobong Peak (aka Samseongbong, 1,150 m) on each side. \n<br><br>\nThe park is within the administrative district of Dong-gu, Daegu and has four towns along its border including Yeongcheon-si, Gyeongsan-si, and Chilgok-gun. A number of Buddhist temples including Donghwasa Temple, the headquarters of the 9th Buddhist Parish, are located in the area. \n<br><br>\nThe park has numerous rocks and valleys and is carpeted with azaleas in the spring.
