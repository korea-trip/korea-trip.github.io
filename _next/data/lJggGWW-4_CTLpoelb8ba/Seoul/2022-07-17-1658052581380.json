The fountain is programmed to play different shows during the day and night. During the day, the fountain shows a hundred different configurations meant to evoke waving willow branches and willow leaves. When the sun goes down, 200 lights illuminate the fountain as it sends out dancing, rainbow-colored jets of water in the air in synchronization with music. <br><br>\n\nBanpo Bridge Rainbow Fountain operates every day from April to October, four to six times a day for 20 minutes. The park also includes an outdoor stage, ecological observing site, and picnic areas.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-2-3780-0578|\n|parking:|Available (Four parking lots / 823 spaces)|\n|usetime:|5~8 times daily<br />* Hours vary by day and season.|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Parking Fees:|Paid parking|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Snack bars (2)|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-17-1658052581380/2030892_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-17-1658052581380/2030892_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-17-1658052581380/2030901_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-17-1658052581380/2030901_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-17-1658052581380/2616878_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-17-1658052581380/2616878_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-17-1658052581380/2616880_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-17-1658052581380/2616880_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-17-1658052581380/2616882_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-17-1658052581380/2616882_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-17-1658052581380/2616883_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-17-1658052581380/2616883_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-2-3780-0578](tel:+82237800578)\n- [üè†hangang.seoul.go.kr](http://hangang.seoul.go.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5076780054\nlongitude: 126.9926825046\ntitle: 40, Sinbanpo-ro 11-gil, Seocho-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway]<br>\nExpress Bus Terminal Station (Seoul Subway Line 3, 7, 9), Exit 8-1.<br>\nWalk for approx. 10 min<br><br>\n\n[Bus]<br>\nGet off at Banpo Hangang Park/Seom Sevit Bus Stop.<br>\nBlue Bus 740\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-17-1658052581380","title":"Banpo Bridge Rainbow Fountain (Î∞òÌè¨ÎåÄÍµê Îã¨ÎπõÎ¨¥ÏßÄÍ∞úÎ∂ÑÏàò)","description":"Banpo Bridge Rainbow Fountain is installed along 570 meters on both sides of Banpodaegyo Bridge, with 380 nozzles spraying water from the river below out into a beautiful show of water, music, and lights.
