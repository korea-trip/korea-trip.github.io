Hanok houses are generally divided into two sections, <em>anchae</em> and <em>sarangchae</em>. Sarangchae is where the men dwell. Because men and women had to remain separated, anchae is situated deep inside the house so that it is secretive and quiet. <br /><br />Another trait of hanok is that all the houses are heated with ondol, a unique floor heating system. Since Koreans enjoy sitting, eating, and sleeping on the floor, it needs to remain heated in winter. To experience what hanok is like, visitors can either book a hanok accommodation or visit the Hanok Life Experience Hall.","regDate":"2023-01-04","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Folk Villages"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-04-1672824967328/2674220_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-04-1672824967328"},{"id":"2023-01-04-1672821551267","title":"Jeonju Donggosa Temple (ÎèôÍ≥†ÏÇ¨ (Ï†ÑÏ£º))","description":"Donggosa Temple, located on Seungamsan Mountain in Jeonju, is a Buddhist temple of the Taego Order.
