For many years the temple lay incomplete until Monk Bojo Chejing began reconstruction in the 7th year of King Gyeongmun of Silla (AD 867). The temple was destroyed at one point in time, but Master Monk Jinul prayed that it be rebuilt. In accordance with his fervent hopes, in the 1600s the monk’s followers rebuilt a number of the temple’s halls and buildings, many of which can still be seen today. The temple is also remembered as the temple that King Injo helped rebuild with the hope that his two sons, who had been taken hostage by the Qing dynasty during the Byeongjahoran War (Chinese invasion of Korea in 1636), would be returned safely and that Buddha would heal the nation.<br><br> One of the Korea’s four major temples, Songgwangsa is home to Jijangbosal and Siwangsang statues (found in Jijangjeon Hall), a Seokgayeorae statue, and 500 Nahansang statues (found in Nahanjeon Hall). The temple is also home to eight Tangible Cultural Assets and four Treasured Cultural Assets  Daeungjeon Hall, the Samsebulsang statues, the bell-tower, and the Sacheonwangsang statue.<br><br>Beloved for its historical significance as well as its beauty, the temple draws throngs of worshipers throughout the year. In spring, many tourists flock to the area to explore the temple and walk through the nearby cherry blossom tunnels. A worthwhile attraction for visitors of all ages, the temple is particularly well-suited for those with mobility problems since it is located on ground level.","regDate":"2023-01-10","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-10-1673343382073/215448_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-10-1673343382073"},{"id":"2023-01-10-1673339945737","title":"Wanggung Five-story Stone Pagoda (익산 왕궁리 오층석탑)","description":"The Wanggung Five-story Stone Pagoda is located on a hill about 2 kilometers south of Wanggung-myeon in Iksan, which is believed to have been the capital of the nation during the Mahan Era.

The valley is also befittingly named Baniram since it is so deep that it only receives direct sunlight for half the day. There are many strangely-shaped rocks like Jjokduri Rock, Cheollyeop Rock, and Daebul Rock scattered throughout the lush valley. At the peak of summer, the area is crowded with vacationers and is also popular for its autumn leaves.","regDate":"2023-01-10","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Valleys"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-10-1673332804228/219600_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-10-1673332804228"},{"id":"2023-01-10-1673328964294","title":"Uhwajeong Pavilion (우화정(내장산))","description":"Uhwajeong Pavilion takes its name from the legend that the pavilion once grew wings and ascended into the heavens.

Tapsa Temple is famous for the over 80 stone pagodas built by Lee Gapyong, a retired scholar. Those stone pagodas have different sizes and shapes from cone-shaped to straight-shaped. Behind Daeungjeon, Cheonjitap tower is located. It is the largest tower, with a x_height 3 times as high as the average adult’s x_height. How this tall tower was built is still unclear, drawing much attention from people. It is said that those stone pagodas were made in the late 1800s entirely by Lee Gapyong alone. He collected stones in daytime and built the pagodas at night. Even though the pagodas have been around for more than 100 years, they have never collapsed nor even moved through strong winds, making them truly amazing.<br>Tapsa Temple is also well known for cherry blossoms in spring, covering an area of 1.9km from Nambu (south) parking lot of Maisan Mountain to the entrance (a 30min walk). This road is the venue for Maisan Cherry Blossom Festival as well. <br><br>* Cheonjitap is comprised of two twin pagodas with x_heights of 13.5m and placed in the south and north directions. Cheonjitap is the main pagoda, making the other pagodas at Tapsa Temple look well-balanced. It is believed that 120 towers originally existed, but only 80 of them remain today. The two towers at the very front are named Ilgwangtap and Wolgwangtap. These groups of towers are strong enough to stand up to typhoon winds, something quite hard to believe, giving the towers a certain mystery. Also, towers are tilted slightly in both directions, showing that Lee Gapyong erected the towers with the direction of the wind in mind.","regDate":"2023-01-10","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-10-1673325568605/1605767_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-10-1673325568605"},{"id":"2023-01-10-1673321782101","title":"Taekwondowon Observatory (태권도공원 전망대)","description":"Taekwondowon located in Muju-gun, Jeollabuk-do, serves as a main center for the 60 million taekwondo practitioners in 182 countries worldwide.
