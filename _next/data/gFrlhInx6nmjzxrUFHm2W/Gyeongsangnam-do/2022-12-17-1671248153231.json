Its current name, meaning to be adorned with silk for eternity, was bestowed upon the mountain by King Taejo in honor of the mountains spiritual powers, which he believed had listened to his 100-day prayer and consequently helped him rise to the throne as the first king of Joseon. Although the mountain is known to have the largest volume of granite rocks in the archipelago, the mountains rich soil made it a home to the largest colony of deciduous trees on the southern coast.
