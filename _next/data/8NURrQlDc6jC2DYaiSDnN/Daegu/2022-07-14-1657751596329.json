In 1899, the church building was constructed with wood using a Korean-style design, but was destroyed by fire a few months after construction began. Father Robert created a new building design and imported stained glass and galvanized iron from France and Hong Kong, since these types of building materials were hard to find in Korea. Construction was finally completed in 1902, three years after the project first started.<br><br>This church is the only remaining structure in Daegu from the early 1900s.
