Baegundongseowon first started as an academic institution that enshrined a memorial tablet of An Hyang, a Confucian scholar whom Ju Se-bung had deep respect for. After Ju Se-bung left the county, Toegye Yi Hwang, a renowned Confician scholar, became his successor and made an official request to the king to be granted a royal charter. The request was well received, and the king renamed the institution to its current name, Sosuseowon.","regDate":"2022-12-14","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-14-1670992906055/2620878_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-14-1670992906055"},{"id":"2022-12-14-1670989158460","title":"Sobaeksan National Park (Gyeongsangbuk-do Region) (ÏÜåÎ∞±ÏÇ∞Íµ≠Î¶ΩÍ≥µÏõê(Í≤ΩÎ∂Å))","description":"Sobaeksan National Park was designated as the 18th national park in December 1987.

A painting of the caving titled Golgulseokgul by Gyeomjae Jeongseon, a famous painter of the era, revealed that there was once a wooden room located in front of the Maebul, but today only a hint of the room remains on the rock. The head of the Buddha (Yukgye) is perched solid and high on the body with a clear profile of the face ‚Äì sharp eyes, small lips and a long and narrow nose. In contrast to the three-dimensional face, the body is broader and flatter. The neck and upper chest sections have eroded over time. The folds in the clothing are nearly parallel, and the arm area has a v-pattern wrinkle, giving it a more realistic and three-dimensional quality. Around the head of the Buddha is a lotus-shaped halo, while the body is surrounded by a rhythmic flame-like halo. The Maebul is believed to have been created during the late Unified Silla Kingdom, as it shows similar craftsmanship to Seated Stone Vairocana Buddha (National Treasure No. 995), which was created in the year 876 and is located in Chukseosa Temple.","regDate":"2022-12-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-13-1670924193942"},{"id":"2022-12-13-1670920819064","title":"Sail Spa Land (ÏÇ¨ÏùºÏò®Ï≤ú)","description":"Sail Spa Land is uniquely located at the top of a mountain.
