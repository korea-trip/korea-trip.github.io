{"pageProps":{"content":"![Gyeongju Gyerim Forest (경주 계림)](/2022-11-28-1669613785218/2493186_image2_1.webp)\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> Gyerim Forest is located between the Cheomseongdae Observatory and Wolseong Fortress. The forest is thickly populated by ancient zelkova and willow trees rooted on gently sloping hills and along the small stream in the northwest part of the woods. According to legend, the forest is closely associated with myths surrounding the birth of Alji, the founder of the Gyeongju Kim clan. As such, it is designated national Historic Site No. 19. <br>Legend has it that King Talhae heard a rooster crying from deep inside the Sirim Woods. Chancellor Hogong was sent to investigate. Upon arriving, he found a rooster crying underneath a tree on which hung a golden box. Hogong immediately reported his find to the king, who instructed him to bring the golden box into the palace. The king opened the box and found a small child inside, Kim Alji. The forest, which had previously been called ‘Sirim’ or ‘Gurim’, became known as ‘Gyerim’, (gye’ meaning rooster). The name Gyerim was also used to refer to the Silla kingdom. <br>Alji was adopted as the king’s son, but because the crown was passed on to King Pasa of the Park family, he never ascended the throne. The Kim clan later became the royal bloodline with the coronation of King Naemul some years later. <br> The memorial stone recording the birth of Kim Alji was erected in the third year of King Sunjos rule in the Joseon dynasty. Located close to the royal fortress of Silla, the forest is still deeply revered as the mystical birthplace of the first ancestor of the royal Kim clan of Silla. Yellow canola blossoms along the path connecting Daereungwon with Gyerim and Banwolseong only add to the magical ambiance of the forest.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-54-779-8743~8759|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-28-1669613785218/2493184_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-28-1669613785218/2493184_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-28-1669613785218/2493185_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-28-1669613785218/2493185_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-28-1669613785218/2493188_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-28-1669613785218/2493188_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-28-1669613785218/2493189_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-28-1669613785218/2493189_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-28-1669613785218/2493190_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-28-1669613785218/2493190_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-28-1669613785218/2493191_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-28-1669613785218/2493191_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-28-1669613785218/2493193_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-28-1669613785218/2493193_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-28-1669613785218/2493194_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-28-1669613785218/2493194_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-28-1669613785218/2493195_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-28-1669613785218/2493195_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-28-1669613785218/2493187_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-28-1669613785218/2493187_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-54-779-8743](tel:+82547798743)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.8326469552\nlongitude: 129.2189978270\ntitle: Gyo-dong, Gyeongju-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Seoul Express Bus Terminal, take an express bus to Gyeongju Bus Terminal.<br>From Gyeongju Bus Terminal Bus Stop, take Bus No. 600 and get off at Wolseong-dong Community Office Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-28-1669613785218","title":"Gyeongju Gyerim Forest (경주 계림)","description":"Gyerim Forest is located between the Cheomseongdae Observatory and Wolseong Fortress.

It was completed in 771 and named ‘The Divine Bell of King Seongdeok.’ However, because the bell was installed at Bongdeoksa Temple, it has also been called the Bell of Bongdeoksa. <br><br>The bell is also known as the Emile Bell, a name derived from an ancient legend in which a child was sacrificed in order to give sound to the bell, whose echoes of ‘em-ee-leh’ resemble the traditional Korean word for mommy.<br><br>The tubular sound pipe at the top of the bell that helps the sound reverberate is a unique feature that can be found only in Korean bells. The yongnyu, which serves as a loop to hang the bell, has been decorated to resemble a dragon’s head. A band of arabesque patterns can be found at the shoulder, and the striking point of the bell is in the shape of a lotus flower. <br><br>The magnificent design and inscription methods used in this bell exemplify the artisans craftmanship of the Unified Silla period. The bell is also inscribed with over one thousand Chinese characters, and its beauty and integrity have been meticulously preserved despite the passage of over 1,300 years.","regDate":"2022-12-14","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-14-1670996181441"},{"id":"2022-12-14-1670992906055","title":"Sosuseowon Confucian Academy [UNESCO World Heritage] (소수서원 [유네스코 세계문화유산])","description":"Sosuseowon Confucian Academy is situated at the foothills of Sobaeksan Mountain. Sosuseowon was the first to receive a royal charter as a private Confucian academy along with financial support and acknowledgement by the king. This academy was originally founded under the name Baegundongseowon in 1542 by a Confucian scholar Ju Se-bung, who was also the magistrate of Punggi County at the time. Baegundongseowon first started as an academic institution that enshrined a memorial tablet of An Hyang, a Confucian scholar whom Ju Se-bung had deep respect for. After Ju Se-bung left the county, Toegye Yi Hwang, a renowned Confician scholar, became his successor and made an official request to the king to be granted a royal charter. The request was well received, and the king renamed the institution to its current name, Sosuseowon.","regDate":"2022-12-14","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-14-1670992906055/2620878_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-14-1670992906055"},{"id":"2022-12-14-1670989158460","title":"Sobaeksan National Park (Gyeongsangbuk-do Region) (소백산국립공원(경북))","description":"Sobaeksan National Park was designated as the 18th national park in December 1987.

He looks as if he is sitting on a cloud, while the closed eyes on the plump face give the impression that he is lost in deep thought. He seems to be watching mankind from his world above the clouds. He is holding a flower in his right hand and his left hand is held up to his chest as if he is preaching.<br><br>His robe is very thin, revealing the curves of the body, and hangs down to the base of the pedestal. The mandorla (Buddhist halo of light), which consists of both the dugwang (light radiating from the head) and hte singwang (light emanating from the Buddha’s body), is also the shrine for the statue, so the image of the Bodhisattva looks more prominent. It is presumed that this rock-carved Bodhisattva was made during the late eighth century during the Unified Silla dynasty.","regDate":"2022-12-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-13-1670927944965"},{"id":"2022-12-13-1670924193942","title":"Seated Rock-carved Buddha at Golgulam Temple (경주 골굴암 마애여래좌상)","description":"The Seated Rock-carved Buddha at Golgulam Temple consists of a Maebul (a Buddha carved in a cliff) at the very top of 12 Buddha images carved in natural rock caves located in a steep cliff of Girimsa Valley. A painting of the caving titled Golgulseokgul by Gyeomjae Jeongseon, a famous painter of the era, revealed that there was once a wooden room located in front of the Maebul, but today only a hint of the room remains on the rock. The head of the Buddha (Yukgye) is perched solid and high on the body with a clear profile of the face – sharp eyes, small lips and a long and narrow nose. In contrast to the three-dimensional face, the body is broader and flatter. The neck and upper chest sections have eroded over time. The folds in the clothing are nearly parallel, and the arm area has a v-pattern wrinkle, giving it a more realistic and three-dimensional quality. Around the head of the Buddha is a lotus-shaped halo, while the body is surrounded by a rhythmic flame-like halo. The Maebul is believed to have been created during the late Unified Silla Kingdom, as it shows similar craftsmanship to Seated Stone Vairocana Buddha (National Treasure No. 995), which was created in the year 876 and is located in Chukseosa Temple.","regDate":"2022-12-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-13-1670924193942"},{"id":"2022-12-13-1670920819064","title":"Sail Spa Land (사일온천)","description":"Sail Spa Land is uniquely located at the top of a mountain.
