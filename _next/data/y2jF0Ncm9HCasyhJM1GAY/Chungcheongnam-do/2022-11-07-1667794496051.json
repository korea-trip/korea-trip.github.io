The name of the mountain comes from the fact that the ridgeline looks like a dragon wearing a chickens crest on its head. The topographical features are what make this mountain stand out and its mysterious folklore is what makes it so interesting. The park features many peaks, including the main peak Cheonhwangbong (alt. 845.1 m), as well as Sambulbong, Yeoncheonbong, and Gwaneumbong Peaks. This mountain is famous for its many interesting sites, with its fantastic rock structures and Yongmunpokpo Falls on the west, Eunseonpokpo Falls to the east, and Amyongchu and Sutyongchupokpo Falls in the south. <br><Br>In spring, cherry blossoms bloom along the path to Donghaksa Temple, and during summer the lush green of the valley is very beautiful. During fall, the maple trees reveal their crimson colored leaves around Gapsa Temple and Yongmunpokpo Falls. The snowcapped peak of Sambulbong in winter is simply breathtaking. Gyeryongsan is full of rare animals and plants, beautiful waterfalls and a rich history with mysterious legends and cultural treasures. To the east is Donghaksa Temple; northwest, Gapsa Temple; southwest, Sinwonsa Temple; and southeast, Yonghwasa Temple.","regDate":"2022-11-08","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongnam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","National Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-08-1667886221428/1600077_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Chungcheongnam-do/2022-11-08-1667886221428"},{"id":"2022-11-08-1667883853084","title":"Gyeryong Musangsa Temple (무상사(계룡))","description":"Musangsa Temple is an international Zen Temple exclusively for foreigners.

Travelers and other foreigners are also welcome to participate in shortened versions of the program, which are typically one week in length. During meditation/program periods, public visits are limited. The temple’s yearly schedule is divided into three sections with the last section providing various events and programs including weekend events and workshops.

The fortress is estimated by some to have been built around AD 538 to protect Sabi (now Buyeo), which was once the capital of the Baekje kingdom (18 BC-AD 66). Other historians, however, believe that the fortress was already in place by AD 500 and modified in 605 into the structure we see today. In either case, some parts of the fortress were reconstructed during the Unified Silla period (676-935) and modified again in the Goryeo (918-1392) and Joseon (1392-1910) eras. <br><br>Busosan Mountain is home to historic landmarks from the Baekje kingdom, including the archaeological site in Gwanbuk-ri, located just in front of Buseosanseong Fortress. Within the fortress, some of the most famous sites include Baekhwajeong Pavilion, Sajaru Pavilion, Banwollu Pavilion, Yeongillu Pavilion, Samchungsa Shrine (dedicated to three loyal subjects of the Baekje kingdom), Gungnyeosa Shrine, Goransa Temple, Gunchangji (military warehouse site), and Suhyeoljugeoji (site of pit houses for the Baekje soldiers). The mountain is also home to Nakhwaam Rock where, according to legend, 3,000 women of the Baekje kingdom threw themselves into the river below after the collapse of the empire.","regDate":"2022-11-08","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Fortresses"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-08-1667881274866/1598872_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Chungcheongnam-do/2022-11-08-1667881274866"},{"id":"2022-11-07-1667814061458","title":"Gudeurae Park (구드래조각공원)","description":"Located at the western end of Busosan Mountain along the Baekma River, the Gudeurae region boasts beautiful scenery and a well-developed sculpture park. The port in the region acted as an entrance to the Sabi Castle during the Baekje dynasty and today serves as a dock for the cruise ship that travels up and down the Baekma River. Restaurants serving delicious regional cuisine are located near the dock, making the area a recommended tourist location for visitors who are looking for a combination of natural beauty and flavorful culinary delights. <br><br>Gudeurae was designated a Korea tourist region in 1985. Following the official designation, a sculpture park housing 59 sculptures was established in the area. Thirty of the works of art were crafted by sculptors residing in Gudeurae who are known for skills that have been handed down from artists dating back to the Baekje Period. The other 29 pieces are from Korean and overseas artists who participated in the International Modern Sculpture Symposium in 1999. The sculptures bring about a sense of beauty that reflects the region’s history as well as modern art, making the park a popular tourist site and retreat for residents. A monument built in memory of a well-known folk song describing the beauty of Gudeurae is also located in the region.","regDate":"2022-11-07","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-07-1667814061458/1954533_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Chungcheongnam-do/2022-11-07-1667814061458"},{"id":"2022-11-07-1667810992863","title":"Goransa Temple (고란약수)","description":"Goransa Temple is located at the foot of the cliffs of Nakhwaam before the Baengmagang River.
