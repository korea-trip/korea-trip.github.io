With its eight peaks, it is home to many temples and historic sites. The mountain also holds great importance in plant chorology as its forests consist of warm-temperate broad-leaved evergreens and deciduous broad-leaved trees. The mountain peak can be reached by trekking for about 2-3 hours from the entrance of Daeheungsa Temple or by the Daeryunsan Cable Car (one way 8-minute), which departs from the entrance on the opposite side of the mountain and takes visitors to a spot right below the peak. From the mountain summit, there is a view of the southern sea and on a clear day, it is possible to see as far as Hallasan Mountain on Jeju Island. Nearby tourist attractions include Uhangri Dinosaur Museum Complex, Usuyeong Tourism Village and Ttangkkeut Village.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-61-534-8992|\n|opendate:|August 13, 2010|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|Check the website for details|\n|usetime:|Summer 09:00-18:00 / Winter 09:00-17:00 <BR>* Closed during bad weather, call ahead for details.|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Tour Course Information:|[Daeheungsa Temple Course]<br>Haenam-eup - Historic Site of Gosan Yun Seon-do ‚Äì Birthplace of Go Jeong-hui ‚Äì Birthplace of Kim Nam-ju ‚Äì Duryunsan Cable Car ‚Äì Daeheungsa Temple ‚Äì Haenam-eup|\n|Film Locations:|Shooting location for KBS Happy Sunday \"Two Days and One Night\"|\n|Available Facilities:|Observatory|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Facility Utilization Fees:|[Round-trip]<br>Adults: 11,000 won / Group (over 30 people): 10,000 won<br>Children: 8,000 won<br><br>* Adults (middle school students and up), Children (ages 3-elementary school students) <br>* 1,000 won off for senior citizens (ages 65 and more)|\n|Reservation Info. for Foreigners:|On-site tickets only|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-18-1674027369493/1564561_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-18-1674027369493/1564561_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-18-1674027369493/1564573_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-18-1674027369493/1564573_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-18-1674027369493/1564589_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-18-1674027369493/1564589_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-18-1674027369493/1564594_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-18-1674027369493/1564594_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-18-1674027369493/1564605_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-18-1674027369493/1564605_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-18-1674027369493/1564607_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-18-1674027369493/1564607_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-18-1674027369493/1564617_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-18-1674027369493/1564617_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-18-1674027369493/1564562_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-18-1674027369493/1564562_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-18-1674027369493/1564563_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-18-1674027369493/1564563_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-18-1674027369493/1564570_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-18-1674027369493/1564570_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-61-534-8992](tel:+82615348992)\n- [üè†www.haenamcablecar.com](http://www.haenamcablecar.com)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 34.4968181405\nlongitude: 126.6253409902\ntitle: 88-45, Daeheungsa-gil, Haenam-gun, Jeollanam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Dong Seoul Bus Terminal or Seoul Central City Bus Terminal, take a bus to Haenam Bus Terminal.<br>\nFrom Haenam Bus Terminal Bus Stop, take a bus bound for Daeheungsa Temple and get off at Duryun Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-18-1674027369493","title":"Duryunsan Cable Car (ÎëêÎ•úÏÇ∞ÏºÄÏù¥Î∏îÏπ¥)","description":"Duryunsan Mountain (700 meters) is a famous mountain in Jeollanam-do.
