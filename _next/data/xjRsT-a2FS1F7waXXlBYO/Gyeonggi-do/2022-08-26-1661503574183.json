Hongneung Tomb is the resting place of Emperor Gojong and his wife Empress Myeongseong, while Yureung Tomb is the resting place of Emperor Sunjong, his first wife Empress Sunmyeonghyo, and his second wife, Empress Sunjeonghyo. Hongneung and Yureung look different from other royal tombs. When the name of the country changed from the Joseon dynasty to the Daehan Empire, the rulers of Korea were called emperors. Therefore, the tombs of the two emperors were modeled after the tomb of the Ming dynasty‚Äôs ruler, King Taizu (Zhu Yuanzhang). Surrounding Hongneung and Yureung are statues carved in the shape of animals such as giraffes, elephants, and lions, which can‚Äôt be seen at the other royal tombs of the Joseon dynasty. The stonework of Hongneung tomb was made in a traditional way, while the stonework of Yureung tomb shows a more realistic and advanced technique.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-31-591-7043|\n|parking:|Available (88 parking spaces / Large vehicles 7, small vehicles 81) <br>09:00-19:00|\n|restdate:|Mondays|\n|usetime:|February-May & September-October: 09:00-18:00<br>June-August: 09:00-18:30<br>November-January: 09:00-17:30<br>* Last ticketing is one hour before closing.|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Bike rack|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Large vehicles 5,000 won / small & medium-sized vehicles 2,000 won|\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals: Adults 1,000 won / Children 500 won<BR>Groups: Adults 800 won / Children 400 won<BR><BR>* Adults (ages 19-64) / Children (ages 7-18)<BR>* Groups: 10 people or more<br>* Free admission: Preschoolers (age 6 & younger), senior citizens (age 65 & older), on culture day (last Wednesday of the month), visitors wearing hanbok <BR><BR>* Additional ticket package: Time package (1 year / 12:00-13:00 / 30,000 won), Lunch time package (10 times / 12:00-14:00 / 3,000 won), 1 month package (10,000 won)|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Not available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-26-1661503574183/219673_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-26-1661503574183/219673_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-26-1661503574183/219675_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-26-1661503574183/219675_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-26-1661503574183/768278_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-26-1661503574183/768278_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-26-1661503574183/768282_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-26-1661503574183/768282_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-26-1661503574183/768284_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-26-1661503574183/768284_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-26-1661503574183/768294_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-26-1661503574183/768294_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-26-1661503574183/1589375_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-26-1661503574183/1589375_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-26-1661503574183/1589379_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-26-1661503574183/1589379_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-26-1661503574183/1589380_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-26-1661503574183/1589380_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-26-1661503574183/219674_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-26-1661503574183/219674_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-31-591-7043](tel:+82315917043)\n- [üè†royaltombs.cha.go.kr](http://royaltombs.cha.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.6315564164\nlongitude: 127.2096231122\ntitle: 352-1, Hongyureung-ro, Namyangju-si, Gyeonggi-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-26-1661503574183","title":"Hongneung and Yureung Royal Tombs [UNESCO World Heritage] (ÎÇ®ÏñëÏ£º ÌôçÎ¶â(Í≥†Ï¢ÖÍ≥º Î™ÖÏÑ±Ìô©ÌõÑ)Í≥º Ïú†Î¶â(ÏàúÏ¢ÖÍ≥º ÏàúÎ™Ö,ÏàúÏ†ï Ìô©ÌõÑ) [Ïú†ÎÑ§Ïä§ÏΩî ÏÑ∏Í≥ÑÎ¨∏ÌôîÏú†ÏÇ∞])","description":"Hongneung and Yureung Royal Tombs is Historic Site No. 207.
