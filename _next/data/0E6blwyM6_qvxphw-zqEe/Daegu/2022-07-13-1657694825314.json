A cable car runs 790m up Apsan and at the foot of the mountain are leisure facilities where visitors can enjoy archery, horseback riding, and swimming. There is also a monument that commemorates the poet Yi Ho-wu as well as Nakdonggang River War Memorial Hall (established in 1979) and Keungol Daedeok Dongsan Hill, which has a fabulous garden perfect for dates or family outings. <br><br> As a major leisure place for Daegu citizens, the park has numerous walking trails. Largely, the routes can be categorized into three groups  ones that start from the park and connect to Apsan Mountain, those that go from the park to Sanseongsan Mountain, and those that wind along to Daedeoksan Mountain. The length of the paths varies from 2km to 4km, allowing visitors to choose the path that best fits their capabilities and preferences. Visitors can capture the view of Daegu from the Apsan Observatory after getting off the cable car.","regDate":"2022-07-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Daegu","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-13-1657705125527/2363709_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Daegu/2022-07-13-1657705125527"},{"id":"2022-07-13-1657701845317","title":"Bongsan Culture Street (Î¥âÏÇ∞Î¨∏ÌôîÍ±∞Î¶¨)","description":"Bongsan Culture Street is a landmark culture & arts place in Daegu.
