The mountain stands high and stretches out like a folding screen. Near the top of the mountain, the granite protrudes in an odd shape creating a tall, grand geographical feature of the mountain. Furthermore, every valley is decorated with an exquisite rock face and lush forest adding to the mountains reputation. Palgongsan Mountain was designated as a provincial park in May 1980. The mountain has many ancient temples and historical sites such as the Gatbawi Stone Buddha, Wonhyosa Temple, Cheonseongsa Temple and Bulgulsa Temple.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-54-880-8300|\n|restdate:|* Subject to closure due to adverse weather conditions.|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Hiking Course:|Palgongsan Mountain main course: 27.2 kilometers, 14 hours<br>Eunhaesa Temple Course 1: 15.4 kilometers, 8 hours<br>Gatbawi Course 1: 11.5 kilometers, 6 hours<br>Gatbawi Course 2-1: 2.1 kilometers, 1 hour 10 min<br>Gatbawi Course 2-1: 2 kilometers, 1 hour<br>Chisangyegok Course 1: 8.5 kilometers, 6 hours<br>Gasansanseong Course 1: 4.7 kilometers, 2 hour 10 min|\n|Areas Open to the Public:|Gyeongsan-si to Chilgok-gun: Gwanbong - Seonbonjae - Neupaejae - Domajae - Yeombulbong Peak - Dongbong Peak - Birobong Peak - Gasanbawibong Peak - Mulbulsan - Hantijae - Chikibong Peak - Gasanbong Peak - Gasanbawi Rock<br>Chilgok-gun: Jinnammun Gate - Cheonjusateo - Yongbawi Rock<br>Yeongcheon-si: Sudosa Temple- Gongsanpokpo Falls - Jinbulam - Dongbong Peak, Baekheungam - Jungangam - Neupaejae<br>Gyeonsan-si: Seonbosa Temple - Yaksaam - Yongdeoksa Temple- Gwanbong Peak|\n|Mountain Not Access Period:|Seasonal Forest Fire Prevention Period<br>Spring: March 2 - April 30 <br>Autumn: November 1 - December 15<br>* Subject to change based on weather advisories, snow/precipitation levels, and other local conditions.|\n|Restricted Mountain Areas :|Chilgok-gun: Witsandang - Gasansanseong Fortress, Morajae - Gasanbawi Rock, Hakmyeong-dong (Dumusil) - Gasansanseong Fortress (Namporu), Yeorijae - Namporu - East Gate<br>Yeongcheon-si: Sudosa Temple- Palgongpokpo Falls - Domajae<br> Gyeongsan-si: Peokjeong (Gatbawi parking lot) - Neupaejae|\n|Tour Course Information:|Tour Course (1 day)<br>1.

Although the main temple hall may seem like an ordinary building with its tile roof and walls, the ceiling and the walls are all part of a cave. Some caves are very small, large enough to allow only one person to sit in, while some are spacious enough to provide room for three to four people. From statues of young monks to old and wise monks, a variety of rock-carved sculptures can be seen placed throughout the caves. The caves are connected by steep stairs carved into the cliff, leading all the way to the top. The Buddha statue situated at the top of the cliff is designated as Treasure No. 581 and is 4 meters in x_height and 2.2 meters in x_width. Unfortunately, this granite statue has gone through deterioration over time and a glass roof is built over the statue to prevent further damage. Golgulsa Temple offers training programs as well as a Templestay program for both domestic travelers and tourists from abroad.","regDate":"2022-11-28","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-28-1669610583651/202535_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-11-28-1669610583651"},{"id":"2022-11-28-1669607257763","title":"Gyeongju Folk Craft Village (Í≤ΩÏ£ºÎØºÏÜçÍ≥µÏòàÏ¥å)","description":"Gyeongju Folk Craft Village consists of 40 thatched and tile-roofed houses, lived in by local artisans of traditional arts and crafts skills.
