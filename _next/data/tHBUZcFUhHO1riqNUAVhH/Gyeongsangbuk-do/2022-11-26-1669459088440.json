Although the main temple hall may seem like an ordinary building with its tile roof and walls, the ceiling and the walls are all part of a cave. Some caves are very small, large enough to allow only one person to sit in, while some are spacious enough to provide room for three to four people. From statues of young monks to old and wise monks, a variety of rock-carved sculptures can be seen placed throughout the caves. The caves are connected by steep stairs carved into the cliff, leading all the way to the top. The Buddha statue situated at the top of the cliff is designated as Treasure No. 581 and is 4 meters in x_height and 2.2 meters in x_width. Unfortunately, this granite statue has gone through deterioration over time and a glass roof is built over the statue to prevent further damage. Golgulsa Temple offers training programs as well as a Templestay program for both domestic travelers and tourists from abroad.","regDate":"2022-11-28","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-28-1669610583651/202535_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-11-28-1669610583651"},{"id":"2022-11-28-1669607257763","title":"Gyeongju Folk Craft Village (Í≤ΩÏ£ºÎØºÏÜçÍ≥µÏòàÏ¥å)","description":"Gyeongju Folk Craft Village consists of 40 thatched and tile-roofed houses, lived in by local artisans of traditional arts and crafts skills.
