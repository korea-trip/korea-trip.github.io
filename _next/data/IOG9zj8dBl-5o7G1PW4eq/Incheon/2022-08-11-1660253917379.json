When the tide is low, visitors will be fascinated by the distinctive co-existence of endless black wetland and the ivory sandy beach. Pine trees surround the coast, giving it a distinctive charm as compared to other beaches. From Masian Beach, visitors can see Silmido Island, which was the location of the events portrayed in, as well as the filming location of the movie \"Silmido (2003),\" that drew such great interest and forced the history of Korean movies to be re-written.
