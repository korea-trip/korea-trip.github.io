In the past, the island was called Ijeokdo Island because it served as a hideout for pirates. The sea, mountain, and shoal exist in harmony.<br>\n<br>\n The beauty of Daeijakdo Island comes from the view of the blue ocean from the peak of Buasan Mountain and the shoal that only appears during low tide. The shoal almost reaches Soijakdo Island and creates a large field of sand. The shoal is also called <em>pulchi</em> and only appears during low tide for six hours a day.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>• For more info: +82-32-851-888|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-12-1657594780125/2661904_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-12-1657594780125/2661904_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-12-1657594780125/2661906_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-12-1657594780125/2661906_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-12-1657594780125/2661907_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-12-1657594780125/2661907_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-12-1657594780125/2661908_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-12-1657594780125/2661908_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-32-851-888](tel:+8232851888)\n- [🏠daeijakdo.kr](http://daeijakdo.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.1749176125\nlongitude: 126.2587835301\ntitle: Ijak-ri, Ongjin-gun, Incheon\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Ferry]<br>\nTake a ferry from Incheon Passenger Port Terminal to the island.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-12-1657594780125","title":"Daeijakdo Island (대이작도)","description":"Ijakdo Island is made up of Daeijakdo Island and Soijakdo Island.

Salted Baendaengi also makes an excellent side-dish for Korean meals. <br> <br>* Baendaengi is one of many types of small prey fish referred to as ‘Soeo’ for their fierce struggle in fishing nets. Soeo have internal organs that are proportionally smaller than other species of fish and are known for their feisty nature.  These attributes are thought to signify a stress-filled life,  which  is why many Koreans refer to narrow-minded or hot-tempered people as ‘baendaengi.’","regDate":"2022-08-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Culture/Art/History","Experience Programs","Cultural Districts"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-08-13-1660395563205"},{"id":"2022-08-13-1660390528798","title":"Hanagae Beach (하나개해수욕장)","description":"Hanagae Beach, the biggest tideland on Muuido Island, features a one-kilometer-long beach covered by fine, powder-like sands.
