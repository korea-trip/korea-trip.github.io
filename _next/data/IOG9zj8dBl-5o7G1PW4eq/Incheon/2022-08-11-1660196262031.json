During Sinmiyangyo (the American invasion in 1871), Gwangseongbo was the fiercest battle ground in Ganghwa. On April 24, 1871, a \n fleet with 1,230 American naval forces led by Rear Admiral John Rodgers landed on Ganghwado Island to demand the \nopening of Korea's ports and commerce. The armed forces attacked Chojijin Fortress \nand Deokjinjin Camp, then marched to Gwangseongbo Fortress, where they engaged in close combat with the warriors of Joseon.
