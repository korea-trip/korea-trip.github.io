More than 97% of the land around the Gunnam flood control dam is part of North Korea. The site is effective in controlling the flooding of the Imjingang River and improving irregular water flow. This area is a key wintering site for various migratory birds such as white-naped cranes, and hooded cranes, with up to 200 birds spending every winter in the area. Given the unique characteristics created by the geographical condition of the area near the border between South and North Korea and the natural environment of the Imjingang River, the site is a great natural ecological habitat for various wildlife. <br><br>The Gunnam Flood Control Theme Park features “The Story of Peace and Love told by Cranes” as its theme. Various story-telling facilities are installed, such as the drum of peace, a wishing tree, and crane structures. There are also outstanding facilities to minimize impact on the environment, such as an alternative habitat for cranes, fishway ecology, and ecological wetlands. The facility makes it a great place to learn about and experience ecology.","regDate":"2022-08-25","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Eco-Tourism Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-25-1661407658717/2480741_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-08-25-1661407658717"},{"id":"2022-08-25-1661403617108","title":"Gungmangbong Recreational Forest (Pocheon) (국망봉자연휴양림 (포천))","description":"Gungmangbong Recreational Forest is situated to the west of Sillobong Peak and Gukmangbong Peak.

It is also on the way to Geumgangsan Mountain. Godaesan is ideal for mountain hiking because of its  natural beauty and well-preserved ecosystem. Moreover, this is the only mountain in South Korea on which the North Korean territory can be seen. <br><br>There are several theories about the origin of the mountain's name. One is that the mountain had been referred to as keungore (big whale) in the past by local residents. Another is that the mountain looks like the banggorae (smoke duct) of a traditional Korean heating system when seen from the Sintan area; this is because the mountain's deep valleys resemble the furrows under that house that facilitate the passage of hot air to heat the room above. On a topographic map, the mountain was also marked as Gotae (like the constellations high above). <br><br>Godaesan also has a dense forest, making it a suitable source of timber and charcoal. Because of its abundant forest resources, a jumak (a tavern or inn that served food and liquor and provided lodging to travelers) village was formed here. The place was well-known for charcoal production prior to the Korean War.<br><br>On November 4, 1907, 150 soldiers from the Korean militia fought a fierce battle with the 8th Company of the Japanese Army's 20th Infantry Regiment in Yeoncheon. After the fight, the Korean militia were scattered throughout  the jumak village. Later on, 60 of them engaged in a fierce battle again with the Japanese soldiers on Godaesan. This is a place imbued with the brave spirit of the Korean people.","regDate":"2022-08-24","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-24-1661334014118/1859997_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-08-24-1661334014118"},{"id":"2022-08-24-1661330755800","title":"Gimpo Jangneung Royal Tomb [UNESCO World Heritage] (김포 장릉(인헌왕후) [유네스코 세계문화유산])","description":"Jangneung Royal Tomb is located in Gimpo, Gyeonggi-do.
