It was also called Jallokgae by residents and female divers in the area. \n<br><br>\nThe construction of Oryukdo Skywalk began on September 12, 2012 at the Seungdumal area, which is regarded as the dividing point between the East Sea and the South Sea, and the skywalk opened on October 18, 2013, with the theme of \"walking over the sky.”\n<br><br>\nIron columns were set up over a 35-meter-high coastal cliff, and a 15-meter glass bridge comprised of 24 glass plates and shaped like a horse’s hoof connect the iron columns. The glass flooring was made by four layers of 12-millimeter glass panels coated with a bulletproof film for a total thickness of 55.49 millimeters, making the structure quite safe. Visitors will be thrilled with the view of the waves while looking down through the transparent floor. The sea stretches out ahead of the skywalk, perfect for a photo op.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-51-607-6395,<br> +82-51-607-4937|\n|opendate:|October 18, 2013|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)<br>(Note: closed in the case of rain or strong wind, and during periods of repairing and improving facility)|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00 (Last admission 17:50)<br>* Operating hours subject to change in the case of adverse weather|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Film Locations:|Movie \"Tidal Wave (2009)\"|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-18-1660797906915/2026246_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-18-1660797906915/2026246_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-18-1660797906915/2026250_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-18-1660797906915/2026250_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-18-1660797906915/2026255_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-18-1660797906915/2026255_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-18-1660797906915/2026257_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-18-1660797906915/2026257_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-18-1660797906915/2617618_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-18-1660797906915/2617618_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-18-1660797906915/2617619_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-18-1660797906915/2617619_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-18-1660797906915/2617620_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-18-1660797906915/2617620_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-18-1660797906915/2622803_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-18-1660797906915/2622803_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-18-1660797906915/2026247_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-18-1660797906915/2026247_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-51-607-6395](tel:+82516076395)\n- [🏠www.bsnamgu.go.kr](https://www.bsnamgu.go.kr/index.namgu?menuCd=DOM_000000116000000000)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.1022800177\nlongitude: 129.1229377062\ntitle: 137, Oryukdo-ro, Nam-gu, Busan\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Local Bus]<br>\nFrom Busan Station (Busan Subway Line 1), Exit 10, take Bus No. 27 and get off at Oryukdo SK View Humun (Backgate) Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-18-1660797906915","title":"Oryukdo Skywalk (오륙도 스카이워크)","description":"Oryukdo Skywalk is located at what was called Seungdumal, meaning a saddle, due to the shape of the point.

It was originally called Songhyeonsan Mountain, which means a mountain with a view of the sea through the dense pine tree forest. Later, the name was changed to Yongdusan Mountain, as the mountain peak was shaped similar to a dragon's head, protecting the area against foreign invaders overseas.<br><br>The mountain held shrines for the mountain gods built by the Japanese before the 8.15 Liberation. Now the mountain is home to a variety of monuments, including Cheokhwabi Monument, Chunghontap Pagoda, 4.19 Revolution Monument, a statue of Admiral Yi Sun-shin, and Busan Tower. During the Korean War, refugees built houses on the sides of the mountain all the way to the summit but these neighborhoods burned down twice, leaving the mountain bare. Since then, fierce efforts of planting trees have led to transforming the burnt mountain into a beautiful park. The park was called Unam Park at the time of the Liberal Party’s ruling but was renamed to Yongdusan Park after the April 19 Revolution. The park offers a beautiful view of Busan Port and the surrounding scenery. In particular, the night view from Busan Tower is magnificent.","regDate":"2022-08-18","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Busan","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-18-1660838172085/2640557_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Busan/2022-08-18-1660838172085"},{"id":"2022-08-18-1660831088170","title":"UN Memorial Cemetery in Korea (재한유엔기념공원)","description":"The UN Memorial Cemetery in Korea honors UN soldiers from 16 countries and UN aids from five countries that were killed in battle during the Korean War from 1950-1953.
