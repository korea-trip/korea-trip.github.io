The area is an important geology and topography learning site where it is visible to see the topography before the formation of the basalt lava field and the fact that the basalt lava flowed over the bedrock to form the lava field. Goseok is a bedrock that existed before the area of Cheorwon was covered with lava, and is a granite formed underground about 110 million years ago (mid Cretaceous period). It is covered in basalt lava by volcanic activity that occurred between about 540,000 and 120,000 years ago, and then eroded by the Hantangang River to form a new waterway.&nbsp;\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>• For more info: +82-33-450-4810|\n|restdate:|Security tour does not operate on Tuesdays and during Seollal (Lunar New Year's Day) & Chuseok (Korean Thanksgiving Day) holidays|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-09-27-1664269269598/2609754_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-27-1664269269598/2609754_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-27-1664269269598/2675250_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-27-1664269269598/2675250_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-27-1664269269598/2675251_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-27-1664269269598/2675251_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-33-450-4810](tel:+82334504810)\n- [🏠www.hantangeopark.kr](http://www.hantangeopark.kr/bbs/content.php?co_id=sight_01_04)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 38.1872292046\nlongitude: 127.2889996684\ntitle: 1825 , Taebong-ro, Cheorwon-gun, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-09-27-1664269269598","title":"Hantangang River [National Geopark] (한탄강(국가지질공원, 고석정))","description":"Goseok Rock, located in the area of Hantangang River, is a granite rock that reach 15 meters in x_height.

Driving from Chuncheon to the dam will take about one hour, but the Kwaeryongho Boat, a hovercraft that operates regularly on Soyangho Lake, only takes about 30 minutes. The hovercraft travels by ejecting air against the surface below, sending up a spray of water on either side of the boat to the delight of passengers. In the valley, visitors can see fish farms floating among the islets. When the water level is high, it is possible to travel on the lake all the way to Inje and Sinnam, enjoying the beautiful scenery of Seoraksan Mountain.

Viewed from the high tower, the East Sea unfolds its boundless ocean and sometimes it looks like a calm lake but can become an energetic ocean full of vitality. Built in 1957, Sokcho Lighthouse still lights up for ships at night. The bright light and sound of the beacon, which has been in service since the lighthouse’s establishment, can show the waterway to a boat, which is about 35 km away from the lighthouse.
