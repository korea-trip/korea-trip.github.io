Driving from Chuncheon to the dam will take about one hour, but the Kwaeryongho Boat, a hovercraft that operates regularly on Soyangho Lake, only takes about 30 minutes. The hovercraft travels by ejecting air against the surface below, sending up a spray of water on either side of the boat to the delight of passengers. In the valley, visitors can see fish farms floating among the islets. When the water level is high, it is possible to travel on the lake all the way to Inje and Sinnam, enjoying the beautiful scenery of Seoraksan Mountain. Both tourists and locals regularly make use of the ferry service.","regDate":"2022-10-14","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-14-1665729241153/176171_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-14-1665729241153"},{"id":"2022-10-14-1665723965765","title":"Soyangho Lake (Inje Section) (소양호-인제)","description":"Soyangho Lake (소양호), one of the biggest manmade lakes in Korea, along with Chungjuho Lake (충주호), was created in 1973 when the world’s fourth largest dam, Soyang Dam, standing 123 meters high, was constructed.

Walking up along the wooden deck trail among the bamboo grove leads you to the observatory, which offers an open view of the deep blue East Sea, the Cheongchoho Lake, which is home to migratory birds, and the magnificent scenery of Seoraksan Mountain. Viewed from the high tower, the East Sea unfolds its boundless ocean and sometimes it looks like a calm lake but can become an energetic ocean full of vitality. Built in 1957, Sokcho Lighthouse still lights up for ships at night. The bright light and sound of the beacon, which has been in service since the lighthouse’s establishment, can show the waterway to a boat, which is about 35 km away from the lighthouse. Right next to the observatory, Yeonggeumjeong Pavilion is situated.","regDate":"2022-10-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-13-1665647612612/2711170_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-13-1665647612612"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
