The sand was used to create what seems like an island floating in the middle of the Hangang River. Nodeulseom Island was left abandoned for the next 50 years until 2005, when the Seoul Metropolitan Government purchased the property. After a series of planning and changes, the island was open to the public in 2019 as a recreational area while preserving most of its original form. Nodeulseom Isand's main attractions consist of a live house, bookstore, music lounges, garden, and more, serving as a cultural entertainment spot to the public.&nbsp;<br>\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-2-749-4500|\n|opendate:|2019ÎÖÑ 09Ïõî 28Ïùº|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|Mondays, New Year's Day, & the day of Seollal (Korean New Year's Day) and Chuseok (Korean Thanksgiving Day)|\n|usetime:|[Outdoors] Open 24 hr<br> [Indoor facilities] 09:00-21:30<br> [Cultural facilities] 12:00-20:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Shopping Information:|Souvenir shop, bookstore, restaurants, cafes, etc.|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Activity Fees:|Varies by program<br>* Refer to the official website and social media channel|\n|Facility Utilization Fees:|Varies by facility<br>* Refer to the official website|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638956_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638956_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638960_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638960_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638963_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638963_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638966_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638966_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638967_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638967_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638968_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638968_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638970_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638970_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638976_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638976_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638980_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638980_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638958_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638958_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-2-749-4500](tel:+8227494500)\n- [üè†nodeul.org ](http://nodeul.org/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5177234407\nlongitude: 126.9580659298\ntitle: 445, Yangnyeong-ro, Yongsan-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-07-1659834417508","title":"Nodeulseom Island (ÎÖ∏Îì§ÏÑ¨)","description":"Originally called Jungjido Island until the 1950s, Nodeulseom Island was a sandy plain used for recreational purposes until the areas of Hangang River underwent development in the '60s and '70s.

Originally, the fortress was 4km in circumference, but due to massive overflowing of Hangang River during flood season in 1925, most of the fortress was lost and only 2.7km of it remains. To the east of the fortress are 4 vestiges of the fortress gates. The remains from the prehistoric era through the  Samguk (Three States) era have been unearthed, indicating that this place was a residential area well before the Baekje Era. Through vigorous excavation, some people suggest that there used to be a  palace located here during the Baekje Era.","regDate":"2022-08-07","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Fortresses"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-07-1659840061906/566413_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-08-07-1659840061906"},{"id":"2022-08-07-1659834580035","title":"Olympic Park (Ïò¨Î¶ºÌîΩÍ≥µÏõê)","description":"Olympic Park is an impressive leisure facility in which historic remains from the Baekje era share space with modern, state-of-the-art sports stadiums, an eco-friendly forest, and spacious grass fields.
