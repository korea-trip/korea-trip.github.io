While the stone pagoda is presumed to be originally a 5-9 story structure, only 3 stories remain today. Much of the damage to the padoga happened during the Imjin War (1592-1598). During restoration work in 1915, money from the Goryeo period was discovered, providing evidence that the temple was also under repair at that time. Additional relics include Hwajaengguksabibu (a memorial stone placed in memory of Wonhyo), Samnyongbyeoneojeong (a well in which the three dragons that protected Silla were believed to reside), and the Standing Buddha of Bunhwangsa Temple, Gyeongsangbuk-do Cultural Heritage No. 319.","regDate":"2022-07-29","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-29-1659094611502/2371528_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-07-29-1659094611502"},{"id":"2022-07-29-1659091500666","title":"Buljeong Recreational Forest (Î∂àÏ†ïÏûêÏó∞Ìú¥ÏñëÎ¶º)","description":"The path to Buljeong Recreational Forest, lined with cherry blossom trees, is a beautiful and dense forest that offers a relaxing walk among the trees.

In 1972, while reconstruction work was being done on Geungnakjeon Hall, records were discovered stating the hall was repaired in 1363.

There are many leisure facilities and parks around the lake, including an international hotel and Gyeongju World. Bomunho Lake is very popular among bikers and walkers. <br /><br />Unlike other cities or towns where cherry trees are only found in certain areas, Gyeongju is packed with cherry blossoms. In spring, the whole cityscape turns pink with the beautiful blossoms. The combination of the stunning trees reflected in the waters of Bomunho Lake and the trees of Bulguksa Park gracefully adorning the nearby temple make for particularly stunning sights. When a light breeze blows, cherry blossoms gently flutter down like satin snow flakes. The Gyeongju Cherry Blossom Marathon is held in April when the cherry blossoms are in full bloom.","regDate":"2022-07-29","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-29-1659080270985/2367727_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-07-29-1659080270985","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-07-29-1659080270985"},{"id":"2022-07-29-1659077331372","title":"Bomun Tourist Complex (Í≤ΩÏ£º Î≥¥Î¨∏Í¥ÄÍ¥ëÎã®ÏßÄ)","description":"Bomun Tourist Complex is the international tourist district of Gyeongju.
