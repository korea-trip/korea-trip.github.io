With many varieties of herbs and wild flowers growing naturally in the area, it is also well known as a place to dig for wild ginseng. Its rare Japanese yew trees and royal azalea combined with its similar terrain to Seoraksan Mountains Daecheongbong Peak has caused the mountain to be a highly protected ecological environment.<br><br>Gyebangsan Mountain is particularly popular for winter hikers, who can get beautiful views of the snowy landscapes of the mountain even&nbsp;until March. On top of that, since the difference in evelation from Unduryeong to the top of Gyebangsan is only 488 m, it welcomes even novice hikers as well. From the summit, one can see the backboone of Baekdudaegan Mountain, and with its panoramic views of Seoraksan Mountain to the north, Odaesan Mountain and Daegwallyeong to the east, and Taegisan and Hoegisan Mountains to the west, it is one of the best views in the area.","regDate":"2022-09-25","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-25-1664102714256/1172063_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-09-25-1664102714256"},{"id":"2022-09-25-1664099000732","title":"Gwongeumseong Fortress (ÏÑ§ÏïÖÏÇ∞ Í∂åÍ∏àÏÑ±)","description":"Gwongeumseong Fortress is the site of a castle ruins located on Seoraksan Mountain, and it is also known as Onggeumsan Mountain Castle, or Toto Castle.
