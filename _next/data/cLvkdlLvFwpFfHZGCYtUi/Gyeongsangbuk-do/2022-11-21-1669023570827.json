He built a small thatched hut here for a temporary stay and continued his search. Finally, he found a perfect place and built Buseoksa Temple. He also set up another temple in the site where his small thatched hut was and called it Choamsa Temple. Choamsa Temple is located below the valley in the south of Gungmangbong Peak of Sobaeksan Mountain. After the Korean War, the temple building had to be rebuilt, but it managed to preserve some of Provincial Tangible Cultural Asset including Samcheung Seoktap (a three-storied stone pagoda; Tangible Cultural Property 126), Dongbudo (East Stupa; Tangible Cultural Property 128) and Seobudo (West Stupa; Tangible Cultural Property 129).<br><br>* Jukgyegugok Valley <br>The valley stretching from Baejeom-ni to Choamsa Temple is called Jukgyegugok which Sobaeksan Mountain surrounds like a folding screen. Near the valley, one can find famous tourist attractions such as the Sosuseowon Confucian Academy and Buseoksa Temple. Toegye Yi Hwang came up with the name Jukgyegugok inspired by the fantastic scenery of the valley and the beautiful sound of the flowing water.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<BR> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-54-633-2322|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Hiking Course:|* Baejeom-ri - Jukgye Valley - Choamsa Temple - Seongnyunamgol Village - Gungmangbong Peak - Birobong Peak<br>* In front of Baejeom Elementary school - 9 Gok - 1 Gok - Choamsa Temple- Gungmangbong Peak - Birobong Peak<br /><br>* In front of Baejeom Elementary school - 9 Gok - 1 Gok-  Gungmangbong Peak- 1 Gok - 9 Gok - n front of Baejeom Elementary school |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Not available|\n  \n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-54-633-2322](tel:+82546332322)\n- [🏠www.yeongju.go.kr](http://www.yeongju.go.kr/open_content/tour)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.9441934902\nlongitude: 128.5262409259\ntitle: 330, Jukgye-ro 315beon-gil, Yeongju-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[BUs]<BR>\nFrom Dong Seoul Bus Terminal, take an intercity bus to Yeongju Bus Terminal.\n<br>From Yeongju Bus Terminal, take Bus No. 53 bound for Sosuseowon Confucian Academy and get off at Choamsa Temple BUs Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-21-1669023570827","title":"Choamsa Temple - Yeongju (초암사(영주))","description":"In search of a great place to build a Buddhist Temple invoking national security, Great Monk Uisang travelled around the country and reached this place.

The city of Goryeong played such a central role in the development of the confederacy that many artifacts and historic sites of the Daegaya period can still be found there today. <br><br>Some of the most prominent landmarks are the 200 gobuns (ancient tombs) that lie along the southeastern slope of Jusan Mountain in Goryeong. In ancient times, the higher and larger a tomb, the higher the social status of the person buried inside. Given this tradition and historical evidence, the largest tomb in the south has been identified as Geumnim Wangneung (Royal Tomb of King Geumnim); the other large tombs are also presumed to be those of the kings of Daegaya. The large royal tombs (over 20m in diameter) dominate the mountain ridge (the highest point) while mid-sized and smaller tombs can be found on the mountain slopes and foothills. <br><br>Historical research on Daegaya began with the excavation and partial identification of the ancient tombs of Goryeong by research teams from Kyungpook National University and Keimyung University in 1977. Excavators discovered a great number of relics—gilt-bronze crowns, swords, armor, and trinkets of gold, silver, and jade—that shed light on the flourishing culture of Gaya. <br><br>To continue to encourage interest in the history and culture of Daegaya, officials of Goryeong-gun County established the Daegaya Royal Tomb Exhibit Hall at the foot of Jusan Mountain in Gobun-gun, Jisan-dong. The exhibition hall depicts the social structure of the era through ancient customs such as burying servants alive with their dead masters.","regDate":"2022-12-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-12-1670820019777/1004711_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-12-1670820019777"},{"id":"2022-12-12-1670816415461","title":"Jikjisa Temple (직지사)","description":"Jikjisa Temple, located at the foot of Hwangaksan Mountain in Gimcheon, Gyeongsangbuk-do, was constructed in 418, during the second year of Silla Kingdom King Nuljis reign.
