Most of the cultural heritages of the district originate from Gwanaksan Mountain. Since it was designated as a city natural park in 1968, it has continued to serve as a favorite place for relaxation and excursion for Seoul citizens. The various rocky peaks and the deep valleys give the mountain a rugged feel. The mountain's size and close proximity to Seoul make it easy for Seoul residents to make a day-trip. <br> <br>In the spring, cherry blossoms are in full bloom near the entrance to the mountain, and a Rhododendron Festival is held when the rhododendrons are in full bloom. At the mountain's summit are Wongaksa Temple and Yeonjuam Hermitage, which were built by Taejo Yi Seong-gye (the founder of the Joseon dynasty) to ward off misfortune when he decided to move the capital to Seoul. There are also other temples and hermitages, and a ground radar observation post. Yeonjudae Hermitage, located atop a cliff, is where all the hiking trails of Gwanaksan Mountain meet.","regDate":"2022-07-23","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-23-1658569005134/1857230_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-07-23-1658569005134"},{"id":"2022-07-23-1658565731617","title":"Gwanaksan Ecological Park (Í¥ÄÏïÖÏÇ∞ ÏÉùÌÉúÍ≥µÏõê)","description":"Opened in December of 2007, Gwanaksan Ecological Park is located on a 76,521 m¬≤ plot of land.

It is said that after retirement, Heo Jun came to Heogabawi Rock to compile the famous medical book Dongui Bogam. <br><br> A part of the Hangang River here was turned into a lake due to the construction of the Olympic Expressway and high-rise apartments surrounding the park. There is a statue of Heo Jun treating a patient and in the lake, there is a purple-colored rock with holes called Gwangju Rock. Before the construction of the Yanghwadaegyo Bridge, this area used to be where visitors would take a ferry (Gongam Ferry) to cross the other side. <br><br>Heogabawi Rock, which is wide enough to accommodate about 20 men, is said to be where people took refuge during wars. Gwangju Rock and Heogabawi Rock is the site of Jechapaeui (the rock where rituals were offered to the God of the Earth and the God of Crops during the Hanseong Baekje period).
