The church was founded in 1887 as a small worship house under the name Bethel by Henry Gerhard Appenzeller, an American missionary. As the number of followers increased, the building underwent construction and officially became a church in 1895. Chungdong Church is the only remaining church building from the 19th century. The church was expanded once more in 1926, changing its from a cross-shaped building to a square one. The expansion was made by adding walls using bricks as not to damage the original building structure. The architecture was built in a simplified version of an American gothic house with arched window frames.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Chinese, Japanese)<br>‚Ä¢ For more Info: +82-2-753-0001~3|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-21-1658439460553/1569255_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658439460553/1569255_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658439460553/1569256_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658439460553/1569256_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658439460553/1569257_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658439460553/1569257_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658439460553/1569258_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658439460553/1569258_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658439460553/1569259_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658439460553/1569259_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658439460553/1955148_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658439460553/1955148_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658439460553/1955151_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658439460553/1955151_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658439460553/1955152_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658439460553/1955152_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658439460553/1955154_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658439460553/1955154_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658439460553/1955155_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658439460553/1955155_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-2-753-0001](tel:+8227530001)\n- [üè†www.chungdong.org](http://chungdong.org/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5654653714\nlongitude: 126.9723466121\ntitle: 46, Jeongdong-gil, Jung-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway]<br>\nCity Hall Station (Seoul Subway Line 1 & 2), Exit 1, 2 or 12.<br>\nWalk for 5 min towards Ehwa Women‚Äôs High School.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-21-1658439460553","title":"Chungdong First Methodist Church (ÏÑúÏö∏ Ï†ïÎèôÍµêÌöå)","description":"Chungdong Church, having being completed in 1897, was the first Christian church that was built after the spread of Protestantism in Korea.
