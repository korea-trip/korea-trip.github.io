There are many legends surrounding the rock. One legend has it that a dragon stealing precious jade from Hallasan Mountain was shot down by an arrow from the mountain deity. When he fell down, his body immediately sank into the ocean and his head rapidly froze looking at the sky. Another legend has it that a white horse, who dreamed of being a dragon and ascending to the sky, came to be caught by a soldier and froze into the rock.<br><br>From Yongduam Rock, visitors can see haenyeo (female divers) working at catching seafood. Near the rock are various cafes, bars, and restaurants. The coastal road between here and Aewol-eup is popular among couples. Cafes and seafood restaurants began to appear there five years ago and now form a pleasant caf√© village.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ Jeju Travel Hotline: +82-64-740-6000|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Restaurants, gift shop, snack bar, restroom, drinking fountain, Tourist Information Center, etc.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Available in English, Japanese, Chinese |\n  \n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-64-740-6000](tel:+82647406000)\n- [üè†www.visitjeju.net](http://www.visitjeju.net/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.5158033889\nlongitude: 126.5119710049\ntitle: Yongduam-gil, Jeju-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Jeju International Airport, take a bus bound for Jeju-si Jungang-ro and get off at Yongdam Rotary.<br>\nWalk toward the beach for 5-10 minutes.<br><br>\n\n[Taxi]<br>\nApprox. 10 min from Jeju International Airport\n","data":{"id":"2023-02-14-1676371136721","title":"Yongduam Rock (Ïö©ÎëêÏïî)","description":"Situated on the northern coast in downtown Jeju, Yongduam Rock is an estimated 10-meter-tall stone that has been worn down over time by strong winds and waves into a shape resembling a dragons head.

It is thought to have been created by the lava that erupted from Hallasan Mountain some 25 million years ago. This cave uniquely contains features of both lava and limestone caves. The entire area surrounding the cave is a huge stratum of seashells and sand, while the interior of the cave has a mystical ambience due to its various formations such as stalactites and stalagmites, hanging from the ceiling and sprouting up from the bottom of the cave. The cave also features pillars formed when stalactites and stalagmites join together. The cave walls are covered in lime, which at times looks like beautiful cave paintings. The temperature inside the cave stays at 17~18‚ÑÉ throughout the year, making the cave a welcome escape from the summer heat and a great place to keep warm during winter. <Br><Br>Hyeopjaegul Lava Tube has been designated Natural Monument No. 236 and ranks among the world‚Äôs major mysterious caves, such as the stone salt cave of Peru and the underwater limestone caves of Yugoslavia. As Hyeopjaegul Lava Tube is close to Ssangyonggul Lava Tube, the two can be visited on the same day.","regDate":"2023-02-16","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-16-1676532952288"},{"id":"2023-02-16-1676529633249","title":"Honinji Pond (ÌòºÏù∏ÏßÄ)","description":"Honinji Pond is connected to a myth of how agriculture and farming started on Jeju Island.
