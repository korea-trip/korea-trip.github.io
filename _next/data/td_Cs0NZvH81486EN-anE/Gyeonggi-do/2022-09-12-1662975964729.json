{"pageProps":{"content":"![Yongmunsan Resort (용문산 관광지)](/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098983_image2_1.webp)\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> Yongmunsan Mountain in Yangpyeong, Gyeonggi-do, is comprised of Doilbong Peak, Baegunbong Peak, and other peaks. The resort shares the area with various cultural relics such as Yongmunsa Temple; Yongmunsa Temple’s gingko tree; a stupa containing a relic of the Buddha, a monument of the reverend monk Jeongji; and the Yongmunsan Mountain area’s war record monument. The resort area is frequented by visitors throughout all four seasons but is especially popular in the fall because of the yellow-tinged gingko tree of Yongmunsa Temple (a Natural Monument).  <br><br>\nA 2 kilometers trek through the valley from Yongmunsa Temple will bring you to Yonggakbawi Rock, shaped like a dragon’s horn, halfway up the mountain. 1km away from Yonggakbawi Rock lays a huge boulder, Court Rock, on which 100 people can easily sit at the same time. There is also an amusement park that provides great entertainment for children, consisting of a rapid ride, a Viking-boat, a merry-go-round, bumper cars, a family coaster, and other rides. <br><br>\nThirty minutes from Yongmunsa Temple is Jungwon Valley that looks small when seen from the outside, but leads to the mountain’s summit where you can enjoy a superb view. And only another fifteen minutes walk will bring you to the three-tiered Jungwon Falls where you can enjoy the sound of crashing waters and feel the cooling mists that rise from the base of the falls.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-31-773-0088|\n|parking:|Available (1,000 parking spaces)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Parking Fees:|Compact vehicles: 1,000 won / Mid-sized vehicles: 3,000 won / Buses: 5,000 won|\n|Available Facilities:|Museum, water fountain, foot-volleyball court, drinking fountain, basketball court, outdoor stage, playground, restaurant, etc.|\n|Admission Fees:|Indivuals: Adults 2,500 won / Teenagers 1,700 won / Children 1,000 won<BR>Groups: Adults 2,300 won / Teenagers 1,500 won / Children 800 won|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098793_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098793_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098798_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098798_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098860_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098860_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098874_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098874_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098933_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098933_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098976_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098976_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098784_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098784_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098806_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098806_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098813_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098813_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098816_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098816_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-31-773-0088](tel:+82317730088)\n- [🏠tour.yp21.net ](https://tour.yp21.go.kr/www/selectTourCntntsWebView.do?tourNo=173&key=69&ctgry=4)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5469452446\nlongitude: 127.5809612468\ntitle: Sinjeom-ri, Yangpyeong-gun, Gyeonggi-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-09-12-1662975964729","title":"Yongmunsan Resort (용문산 관광지)","description":"Yongmunsan Mountain in Yangpyeong, Gyeonggi-do, is comprised of Doilbong Peak, Baegunbong Peak, and other peaks.
