But in 1973, when the Empor Alpine Club reached the mountain during a hike \nacross the nation, the club members named it after Jin Yu-myeong, a member of the expedition. On old maps, the mountain had been called Mayusan Mountain because of the horses raised in the area, but today it is more widely known as Yumyeongsan Mountain. The trail that starts from Yangpyeong leads to an expansive and open grassland. The hiking trails are also connected to those of Mount Daebusan and Mount Sogunisan. On the summit, there is a pile of stones, and the view from the top is splendid.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-31-582-8830|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Mountain Not Access Period:|Seasonal Forest Fire Watches<br>Spring: March 2-April 30 <br>Autumn: November 1-December 15<brNational Park: November 15-December 15 (Excluding Gyeongju and Taean)<br>* Periods and areas are subject to change based on fire weather advisories, snow/precipitation levels, and other local conditions|\n|Restricted Mountain Areas :|[Refer to the website.](http://hiking.kworks.co.kr/sub_map/map_user01.aspx)|\n|Hiking Course:|* Course 1: Yumyeongsan Recreational Forest Office ‚Üí Odalsaem Spring ‚Üí Peak ‚Üí Yumyeongsan Valley ‚Üí Yongso ‚Üí Bakjwiso ‚Üí The&nbsp;entrance of valley<br>* Course 2: Gail-ri Parking Lot&nbsp;‚Üí Direction Board&nbsp;‚Üí Yumyeongsan Valley&nbsp;‚Üí Peak (4.3km, 3 hours)<br>* Course 3: Gail-ri Parking Lot&nbsp;‚Üí Direction Board&nbsp;‚Üí Bungneung&nbsp;Peak (2.6km, 1hr 30min)|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-09-13-1663045696681/1358719_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-13-1663045696681/1358719_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-13-1663045696681/1358726_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-13-1663045696681/1358726_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-13-1663045696681/1358728_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-13-1663045696681/1358728_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-13-1663045696681/1358730_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-13-1663045696681/1358730_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-13-1663045696681/1358731_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-13-1663045696681/1358731_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-13-1663045696681/1358732_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-13-1663045696681/1358732_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-13-1663045696681/1358733_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-13-1663045696681/1358733_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-13-1663045696681/1358735_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-13-1663045696681/1358735_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-13-1663045696681/1358737_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-13-1663045696681/1358737_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-31-582-8830](tel:+82315828830)\n- [üè† www.gptour.go.kr ]( http://www.gptour.go.kr/site/foreign/english)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5891664270\nlongitude: 127.4885156371\ntitle: Okcheon-myeon, Yangpyeong-gun & Seorak-myeon, Gapyeong-gun, Gyeonggi-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \nFrom Dong Seoul Bus Terminal, take an intercity bus to Cheongpyeong (Ï≤≠Ìèâ).\n<br><br>From Cheongpyeong Terminal, take a local bus to Yumyeongsan Mt.<br>* Bus \nSchedule: 08:00, 10:20, 12:10, 14:30, 16:20, 19:10, 20:30<br>(Bus schedule is \nsubject to change/Inquiries: +82-31-584-0539)\n","data":{"id":"2022-09-13-1663045696681","title":"Yumyeongsan Mountain (Ïú†Î™ÖÏÇ∞)","description":"Originally, no name was given to this mountain on topographical maps.
