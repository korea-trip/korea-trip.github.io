He built a small thatched hut here for a temporary stay and continued his search. Finally, he found a perfect place and built Buseoksa Temple. He also set up another temple in the site where his small thatched hut was and called it Choamsa Temple. Choamsa Temple is located below the valley in the south of Gungmangbong Peak of Sobaeksan Mountain. After the Korean War, the temple building had to be rebuilt, but it managed to preserve some of Provincial Tangible Cultural Asset including Samcheung Seoktap (a three-storied stone pagoda; Tangible Cultural Property 126), Dongbudo (East Stupa; Tangible Cultural Property 128) and Seobudo (West Stupa; Tangible Cultural Property 129).<br><br>* Jukgyegugok Valley <br>The valley stretching from Baejeom-ni to Choamsa Temple is called Jukgyegugok which Sobaeksan Mountain surrounds like a folding screen.

The fortress takes after its name, which, literally translates to mean a crescent moon shape on top of a hill. The famous history books of Samgukyusa mention that Silla‚Äôs 4th King Seoktalhae (AD 57~80) thought this area was an ideal spot for the fortress and bought the land from a nobleman.  The 2nd King Namhae (AD 4~24) impressed by Seoktalhae‚Äôs actions, took him in as his son-in-law, later, becoming the 4th king.  The area was then under Silla‚Äôs rule for 900 years, the last king being the 56th, Gyeongsoon (AD 927~935).  <br><br>Although the magnificent grandeur of the palace is now just an empty lot, it has been told that this area was filled with imperial buildings during the Silla dynasty.  Currently, the region of Wolseong has a freezer made out of rocks called Seokbinggo, an archery range, horse-riding field, and a traditional playground, which resembles the grounds of the Joseon Period (the dynasty that ruled the Korean peninsula from 1392-1910).","regDate":"2022-11-29","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Fortresses"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-29-1669718411779/2601687_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-11-29-1669718411779"},{"id":"2022-11-29-1669711353031","title":"Gyeongju Tomb of King Muyeol, Stele of King Taejong Muyeol (Í≤ΩÏ£º Î¨¥Ïó¥ÏôïÎ¶â, ÌÉúÏ¢ÖÎ¨¥Ïó¥ÏôïÎ¶âÎπÑ)","description":"The Tomb of King Muyeol is the tomb of Kim Chun-chu, who acsended to the throne as King Muyeol (r. 654-661), the 29th ruler of the Silla Kingdom.
