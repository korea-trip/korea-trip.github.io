{"pageProps":{"content":"![Girimsa Temple (Í∏∞Î¶ºÏÇ¨)](/2022-11-25-1669361755171/179593_image2_1.webp)\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> Girimsa Temple is located in Hamwolsan Mountain in Yangbuk-myeon, Gyeongju. The temple was built in the Silla Era and, with 16 buildings, is the second largest temple after Bulguksa. <br><br>Legend has it that the temple was originally built by the Venerable Gwang-yu, a sage from India, in the early part of the Silla Kingdom. The temple was reportedly called Imjeongsa at first, but was later changed to Girimsa after undergoing expansive renovations by Monk Wonhyo. It is still unclear exactly what year the temple was built in.   <br><br>Girimsa is divided into two main areas. The first is the area around Daejeokgwangjeon Hall where the statue of Birojanabul is enshrined. The second is the area around the majestic 500-year-old bo tree (a kind of large fig tree) that is home to a wooden pagoda, the Seongbo Museum, Samsingak, Mangbujeon, and Gwaneumjeon halls. Daejeokgwangjeon Hall was first built during Queen Seondeoks reign, and was rebuilt six times since its original construction. Its simple but majestic architecture is characterized by baeheullim (aka, entasis columns) and a Dapoyangsik (Dapo-style) single-tiered gabled roof. <br><br>Girimsa is famous for Ojongsu, water that is said to have five different tastes. It consists of gamrosu, which is best for making tea; hwajeongsu, which supposedly gives comfort to the drinker; janggunsu, which makes the body stronger; myeongansu, which gives clear vision; and otaksu, which is said to sparkle so brightly that it attracts all the birds of the air. During Japanese colonial rule, the source of janggunsu, literally meaning ‚Äòwater of a general,‚Äô was reportedly blocked off by Japanese soldiers, who were afraid the water would give the Korean people the strength to overthrow them. Except for janggunsu, water still continues to flow from each source. <br>On the way to Girimsa temple is Golgulsa Temple, well known for its 12 grottos. Golgulsa was originally a hermitage of Girimsa. After becoming an independent institution, it became the center of Seonmudo practice in Korea. The temple aims to promote the art of seonmudo on a national and international level.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-54-744-2292|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Winter season 08:00-17:00 / Summer season 08:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Sedans 1,000 won / Large-sized cars 2,000 won / Buses 3,000 won|\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 3,000 won / Teenagerss  2,000 won / Children 1,500 won<br>Groups - Adults 3,000 won / Teenagers 1,500 won / Children 1,200 won<br><br> * Groups: 20 people or more (not valid for adults)<br>* Free admission: senior citizens (ages 65 & older), people with a disability|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Not available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-25-1669361755171/179594_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-25-1669361755171/179594_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-25-1669361755171/179596_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-25-1669361755171/179596_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-25-1669361755171/179597_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-25-1669361755171/179597_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-25-1669361755171/179603_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-25-1669361755171/179603_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-25-1669361755171/1201008_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-25-1669361755171/1201008_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-25-1669361755171/1201013_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-25-1669361755171/1201013_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-25-1669361755171/1201041_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-25-1669361755171/1201041_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-25-1669361755171/1201050_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-25-1669361755171/1201050_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-25-1669361755171/179595_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-25-1669361755171/179595_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-25-1669361755171/179602_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-25-1669361755171/179602_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-54-744-2292](tel:+82547442292)\n- [üè†kirimsa.net</a> (Korean only)<br><a href=\"https://www.templestay.com/temple_info.asp?t_id=kirimsa\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"web\">www.templestay.com](http://www.kirimsa.net/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.8381387201\nlongitude: 129.4034954028\ntitle: 437-17, Girim-ro, Gyeongju-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br> From \nDong Seoul Terminal, take a bus to Gyeongju Bus Terminal. <br>- Take city bus no. \n100 or 150 towards Gampo or Yangnam and get off near \nYangbuk-myeon Eoil-ri. <br>\n- Take a taxi (cost approximately 6,000 won)\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-25-1669361755171","title":"Girimsa Temple (Í∏∞Î¶ºÏÇ¨)","description":"Girimsa Temple is located in Hamwolsan Mountain in Yangbuk-myeon, Gyeongju.

The fortress takes after its name, which, literally translates to mean a crescent moon shape on top of a hill. The famous history books of Samgukyusa mention that Silla‚Äôs 4th King Seoktalhae (AD 57~80) thought this area was an ideal spot for the fortress and bought the land from a nobleman.  The 2nd King Namhae (AD 4~24) impressed by Seoktalhae‚Äôs actions, took him in as his son-in-law, later, becoming the 4th king.  The area was then under Silla‚Äôs rule for 900 years, the last king being the 56th, Gyeongsoon (AD 927~935).  <br><br>Although the magnificent grandeur of the palace is now just an empty lot, it has been told that this area was filled with imperial buildings during the Silla dynasty.  Currently, the region of Wolseong has a freezer made out of rocks called Seokbinggo, an archery range, horse-riding field, and a traditional playground, which resembles the grounds of the Joseon Period (the dynasty that ruled the Korean peninsula from 1392-1910).","regDate":"2022-11-29","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Fortresses"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-29-1669718411779/2601687_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-11-29-1669718411779"},{"id":"2022-11-29-1669711353031","title":"Gyeongju Tomb of King Muyeol, Stele of King Taejong Muyeol (Í≤ΩÏ£º Î¨¥Ïó¥ÏôïÎ¶â, ÌÉúÏ¢ÖÎ¨¥Ïó¥ÏôïÎ¶âÎπÑ)","description":"The Tomb of King Muyeol is the tomb of Kim Chun-chu, who acsended to the throne as King Muyeol (r. 654-661), the 29th ruler of the Silla Kingdom.
