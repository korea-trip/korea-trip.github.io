One day, the maid took her husband’s boat out to sea to harvest seaweed. Her husband dropped her off at a site  that was at a distance from the beach. After promising to pick her up later, he returned to the beach to do his work. However, the weather turned bad as strong winds and pummeing waves begun. The husband failed to rescue his wife on time and she ultimately drowned. Since then, the villagers were unable to catch any fishes and some claimed that it wasbecause of the dead maid. To soothe the spirit of the dead maid, the villagers made several wooden carvings and held religious ceremonies. Later, fishes were gradually seen appearing and the villagers were able to fish and live comfortably again. Therefore, the place where the maid died was named Aebawi Rock and the building where the religious ceremony is held twice a year was named Haesindang. The ceremony is still honored today as a traditional folk event.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-33-572-4429|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|Every 18th of each month. <br>* If this date falls on a public holiday, it’s closed on the next working day instead.|\n|usetime:|March-October 09:00-18:00<br>November-February 09:00-17:00<br>* Last admission is one hour before closing.|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Admission Fees:|Adults: 3,000 won / Group: 2,000 won <br>Teenagers:  2,000 won / Group: 1,500 won<br>Children & Senior citizens: 1,500 won / Group: 1,000 won<br><br>* Senior citizens (ages 65 & older): Proof required|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-10-10-1665385902206/1425837_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-10-1665385902206/1425837_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-10-1665385902206/1425862_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-10-1665385902206/1425862_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-10-1665385902206/1425866_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-10-1665385902206/1425866_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-10-1665385902206/1425869_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-10-1665385902206/1425869_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-10-1665385902206/1425871_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-10-1665385902206/1425871_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-10-1665385902206/1425875_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-10-1665385902206/1425875_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-10-1665385902206/1425878_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-10-1665385902206/1425878_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-10-1665385902206/1425880_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-10-1665385902206/1425880_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-10-1665385902206/1425881_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-10-1665385902206/1425881_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-10-1665385902206/1425836_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-10-1665385902206/1425836_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-33-572-4429](tel:+82335724429)\n- [🏠www.samcheok.go.kr](http://www.samcheok.go.kr/tour.web)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.2680078425\nlongitude: 129.3273124779\ntitle: 1852-6, Samcheok-ro, Wondeok-eup, Samcheok-si, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Samcheok \nIntercity Bus Terminal, take Bus No. 24 to Haesindang Park Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-10-10-1665385902206","title":"Samcheok Haesindang Park (삼척 해신당공원)","description":"Haesindang Park is home to the the nation’s largest aquarium museum,&nbsp;which exhibits  folk materials that shows the  lifestyle of fishermen of the East Sea,  an arboretum and a park that displays&nbsp;some sexual art sculptures.
