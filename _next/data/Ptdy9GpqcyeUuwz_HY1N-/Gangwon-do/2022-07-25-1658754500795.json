Chuncheon-style dakgalbi originates from the story in which people marinated chicken instead of pork and grilled it with charcoal like pork ribs in the 1960s. Later, various vegetables, such as cabbage and onion, were added to the dish and stir-fried together on an iron plate. As people can eat it plenty at a reasonable price, dakgalbi has been popular among college students and soldiers, and at this time, dakgalbi earned its nicknames such as “People’s galbi (ribs)”, and “College students’ galbi.” The Dakgalbi Alley was established as dakgalbi restaurants were opened one by one on the backstreet of Myeongdong in Chuncheon, in the 1970s to 1980s. Currently, this 150 m-long alley is packed with dakgalbi restaurants on both sides. Along with charcoal-grilled spicy chicken and spicy griddled chicken, customers can try Chuncheon buckwheat noodles, which are also a famous local delicacy. The information panel explaining the history of Chuncheon spicy stir-fried chicken is installed in the alley. This alley is also known for the filming location for the Korean TV entertainment program Infinite Challenge and other programs.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>• For more info: +82-33-250-4312|\n|parking:|Not available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available inside restaurants|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-25-1658754500795/2364911_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658754500795/2364911_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658754500795/2365605_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658754500795/2365605_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658754500795/2365606_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658754500795/2365606_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658754500795/2365607_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658754500795/2365607_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658754500795/2365608_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658754500795/2365608_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658754500795/700186_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658754500795/700186_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658754500795/700189_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658754500795/700189_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658754500795/700190_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658754500795/700190_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-33-250-4312](tel:+82332504312)\n- [🏠ccdakgalbistreet.modoo.at/</a> (Korean only)<br><a href=\"http://tour.chuncheon.go.kr\" target=\"_blank\">tour.chuncheon.go.kr](http://ccdakgalbistreet.modoo.at/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.8795676643\nlongitude: 127.7276076035\ntitle: Joyang-dong, Chuncheon-si, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Chuncheon Intercity Bus Terminal, take Bus No. 7, 9, 64 or 64-2 and get off at Chuncheon's Myeong-dong Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-25-1658754500795","title":"Chuncheon Myeongdong Dakgalbi Street (춘천 명동 닭갈비 골목)","description":"This alley is lined with dakgalbi (spicy stir-fried chicken) restaurants in Myeong-dong, which is Chuncheon’s high street.

It was first established at the site of Kensington Hotel, but after being destroyed by fire several times, it was rebuilt at the present position during the reign of King Injo of the Joseon dynasty. According to a legend, Monks Yeongseo, Hyewon, and Yeonok all had envisioned the location in their dreams in which a white-haired heavenly man appeared and indicated them the place of the temple. Thus, the temple was re-constructed at the current location and renamed as “Sinheungsa,” meaning “the temple was blessed by God (sin) and became prosper (heung). However, the Chinese character sin of the temple’s name was changed in 1995 from sin meaning god to sin meaning “new,” wishing that the temple will revive Buddhism again in the Yeongdong area (eastern part of the Taebaek Mountain Range). Sinheungsa Temple is home to many cultural heritages including the Geungnakbojeon Hall at Sinheungsa Temple (Treasure) and the Three-story Stone Pagoda at Hyangseongsa Temple Site (Treasure), which is standing on the opposite side of Kensington Star Hotel . The temple also offers the temple stay program in which participants can experience a temple life by doing activities such as communal Buddhist meal service (baru gongyang), ceremonial service involving chanting, 108 bows aimed at removing 108 earthly desires, as well as programs of making a lotus lantern and Buddhist rosary.","regDate":"2022-10-27","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-27-1666847343609/166406_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-27-1666847343609"},{"id":"2022-10-26-1666781111969","title":"Seungilgyo Bridge (승일교)","description":"Seungilgyo Bridge is unique in that it was jointly built by South and North Korea.

It was designated as Koreas fifth national park in 1970 after the designation of Hallyeohaesang National Park, and as Koreas first UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1982. It has been also registered in the IUCN Green List of Protected and Conserved Areas, which is the global standard of best practice for area-based conservation. Having Daecheongbong Peak as the mountains main peak, Seoraksan National Park, with a total area of 398 km², is divided  into the outer section (Oeseorak, eastern section), the inner section (Naeseorak, western section), and the southern section (Namseorak). Daecheongbong Peak (1,708 m) is the third highest peak in Korea after Hallasan Mountain and Jirisan Mountain, and as the peak is covered with snow for five to six months of the year, the mountain got the name Seorak (meaning a snowy peak). The summit of Daecheongbong Peak commands the magnificent natural landscape of Seoraksan Mountain and the East Sea. In particular, it is known for the fantastic views of the sunrise and sunset. In addition to Daecheongbong Peak, Seoraksan Mountain has some 30 grand peaks, such as Socheongbong, Hwachaebong, and Jungcheongbong. The mountain is also full of hidden scenic views of Biryongpokpo Falls, Ulsan Peak, Heundeulbawi Rock, and Geumganggul Cave.

It is also the origin of most of Seoraksan Mountain’s famous valleys, like Cheonbuldong and Gayadong Valleys. Because of erratic weather and low temperature, Daecheongbong Peak is often covered in snow from late October to late spring. Its ridges are populated by Siberian dwarf pine, Hairy Korean rhododendron, Ermans birch, and subalpine trees, making it a valuable source for alpine plant research. Four trails in the Seoraksan National Park take the visitors to this peak, through Osaek, Baekdam, Seorak-dong, and Osaengnyeong (Hangyeryeong) Pass. The shortest trail is the 5 km-long Osaek Trail (Osaek – Seorak Falls – Daecheongbong Peak), taking about 4 hr in total. The management controls entry to Seoraksan National Park depending on weather conditions and period, so visitors are advised to check the real-time information provided at its webpage (www.knps.or.kr).","regDate":"2022-10-26","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-26-1666774080396/780821_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-26-1666774080396"},{"id":"2022-10-26-1666770117736","title":"Robot Studio (토이로봇관)","description":"Robot Studio is an experiential exhibition hall that presents a vision of the future robotics, featuring experiment robots, robot avatars, and reproduction of movie scenes.
