The source water originates from the Jangcheoncheon Stream, passing through the lake, and goes to the East Sea via the waterway under the Yeongnanggyo Bridge. The lake is adjacent to the areas of Jangsa-dong, Yeongnang-dong, Dongmyeong-dong, and Geumho-dong. The pleasant trail is also established around the lakeside, surrounded by the beautiful scenery of cherry blossoms, azaleas, and reeds. According to Samguk yusa (Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms), the name of the lake comes from Silla‚Äôs hwarang (elite warrior group in Silla) member named ‚ÄúYeongnang.‚Äù After training at Geumgangsan Mountain, Yeongnang passed this lake on the way to get to the martial arts competition. As he was so taken by the splendid landscape, however, he forgot about the competition and stayed here for a long time. As the old record says, Yeongnangho Lake boasts outstanding scenery. Beombawi Rock, in particular, evokes visitors‚Äô admiration as one of the Eight Sights of Sokcho. The rock, which resembles the shape of a tiger crouching down, has an aura of mystery. The nearby tourist attractions also include Gwaneumam Rock, which is known for the strange rocks and bizarre stones, Bogwangsa Temple, and the Wetland Eco Park, which is located in the west of the lakeside.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-33-639-2690|\n|parking:|Not available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Open 24 hr|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-10-18-1666090450530/677375_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-18-1666090450530/677375_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-18-1666090450530/2494926_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-18-1666090450530/2494926_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-18-1666090450530/2494928_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-18-1666090450530/2494928_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-18-1666090450530/2711166_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-18-1666090450530/2711166_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-18-1666090450530/2711167_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-18-1666090450530/2711167_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-18-1666090450530/2711168_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-18-1666090450530/2711168_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-18-1666090450530/2711169_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-18-1666090450530/2711169_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-18-1666090450530/2494930_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-18-1666090450530/2494930_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-33-639-2690](tel:+82336392690)\n- [üè†www.sokchotour.com](http://www.sokchotour.com)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 38.2142227476\nlongitude: 128.5807503766\ntitle: 140, Yeongnanghoban-gil, Sokcho-si, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Dong Seoul Bus Terminal, take a bus to Sokcho Express Bus Terminal.<br>\nFrom Sokcho Express Bus Terminal Bus Stop, take Bus No. 7-1 or 9-1 and get off at Yeongnanggyo Bridge Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-10-18-1666090450530","title":"Yeongnangho Lake (ÏòÅÎûëÌò∏)","description":"Yeongnangho Lake is a deep and large lake with a circumference of 7.8 km, an area of about 1.2 km2, and a depth of over 8 m, formed by the development of coastal dunes.

It was first established at the site of Kensington Hotel, but after being destroyed by fire several times, it was rebuilt at the present position during the reign of King Injo of the Joseon dynasty. According to a legend, Monks Yeongseo, Hyewon, and Yeonok all had envisioned the location in their dreams in which a white-haired heavenly man appeared and indicated them the place of the temple. Thus, the temple was re-constructed at the current location and renamed as ‚ÄúSinheungsa,‚Äù meaning ‚Äúthe temple was blessed by God (sin) and became prosper (heung). However, the Chinese character sin of the temple‚Äôs name was changed in 1995 from sin meaning god to sin meaning ‚Äúnew,‚Äù wishing that the temple will revive Buddhism again in the Yeongdong area (eastern part of the Taebaek Mountain Range). Sinheungsa Temple is home to many cultural heritages including the Geungnakbojeon Hall at Sinheungsa Temple (Treasure) and the Three-story Stone Pagoda at Hyangseongsa Temple Site (Treasure), which is standing on the opposite side of Kensington Star Hotel .

It has been also registered in the IUCN Green List of Protected and Conserved Areas, which is the global standard of best practice for area-based conservation. Having Daecheongbong Peak as the mountains main peak, Seoraksan National Park, with a total area of 398 km¬≤, is divided  into the outer section (Oeseorak, eastern section), the inner section (Naeseorak, western section), and the southern section (Namseorak). Daecheongbong Peak (1,708 m) is the third highest peak in Korea after Hallasan Mountain and Jirisan Mountain, and as the peak is covered with snow for five to six months of the year, the mountain got the name Seorak (meaning a snowy peak). The summit of Daecheongbong Peak commands the magnificent natural landscape of Seoraksan Mountain and the East Sea. In particular, it is known for the fantastic views of the sunrise and sunset. In addition to Daecheongbong Peak, Seoraksan Mountain has some 30 grand peaks, such as Socheongbong, Hwachaebong, and Jungcheongbong. The mountain is also full of hidden scenic views of Biryongpokpo Falls, Ulsan Peak, Heundeulbawi Rock, and Geumganggul Cave.

It is also the origin of most of Seoraksan Mountain‚Äôs famous valleys, like Cheonbuldong and Gayadong Valleys. Because of erratic weather and low temperature, Daecheongbong Peak is often covered in snow from late October to late spring. Its ridges are populated by Siberian dwarf pine, Hairy Korean rhododendron, Ermans birch, and subalpine trees, making it a valuable source for alpine plant research. Four trails in the Seoraksan National Park take the visitors to this peak, through Osaek, Baekdam, Seorak-dong, and Osaengnyeong (Hangyeryeong) Pass. The shortest trail is the 5 km-long Osaek Trail (Osaek ‚Äì Seorak Falls ‚Äì Daecheongbong Peak), taking about 4 hr in total.
