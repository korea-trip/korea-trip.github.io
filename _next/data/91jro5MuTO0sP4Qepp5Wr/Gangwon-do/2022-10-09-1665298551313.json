{"pageProps":{"content":"![Samaksan Mountain (삼악산 (춘천))](/2022-10-09-1665298551313/1842025_image2_1.webp)\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> Samaksan Mountain, paralleling to Uiamho Lake and the Bukhangang River, is one of the best scenic mountains in Chuncheon. As the mountain (san) comprises three rocky peaks (samak), which are Yonghwabong (main peak, 654 m), Cheongunbong (546 m), and Deungseonbong (632 m), it was named Samaksan Mountain. Although it is not a high and majestic mountain, it is considered a mountain with splendid scenery. Samaksan Mountain embraces a fantastic gorge formed through quartzitic jointing and waterfalls. Waterfalls in different sizes, such as Deungseon Falls, Seunghak Falls, and Juryeom Falls, create the splendid landscape, and the top of the mountain commands a panoramic view of downtown Chuncheon along with Uiamho Lake and the Bukhangang River. As its name tells, Samaksan Mountain is known for its rugged and precipitous features (aksan meaning a rugged, rocky mountain). The main access road to the mountain starts from the Deungseon Falls’ ticket booth and the Uiam Ticket Booth, and the trail from Uiam covers a hard, rocky section. As Gangwon-do Monument No. 16, Samaksan Mountain also has various interesting attractions, including Sangwonsa Temple, Heungguksa Temple, and Samaksanseong Fortress.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-33-1330<br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-33-262-2215|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|Open year round|\n|usetime:|00:00–24:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Hiking Course:|[Course 1] <br>Uiam Dam - Sangwonsa Temple – Cheolgyedan Stairs - Samaksan Mountain – Heungguksa Temple - Deungseonpokpo Falls (Distance 3.9km / Travel time: approx. 2 hrs 5 min) <br><br>[Course 2] <br>Gangchongyo Bridge – Amneung Tomb – Deungseonbong Peak – 619-bong Peak - Heungguksa Temple - Deungseonpokpo Falls (Distance 4.5km / Travel time: approx. 2 hrs 55 min) <br><br>[Course 3] <br>Uiam Dam - Samaksan Mountain - 564-bong Peak - Deungseonbong Peak - Gangchongyo Bridge (Distance 5.8km / Travel time: approx. 3 hrs 55min)|\n|Parking Fees:|Subcompact vehicles: KRW 1,000, Small vehicles: KRW 2,000, Large vehicles: KRW 4,000|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|KRW 2,000|\n  \n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-33-262-2215](tel:+82332622215)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.8257698724\nlongitude: 127.6593320769\ntitle: 159, Baksa-ro, Seo-myeon, Chuncheon-si, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nTake a bus from Gangchon Station (Gyeongchun Line) to Samaksan Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-10-09-1665298551313","title":"Samaksan Mountain (삼악산 (춘천))","description":"Samaksan Mountain, paralleling to Uiamho Lake and the Bukhangang River, is one of the best scenic mountains in Chuncheon.

At that time, Preceptor Jinghyo earned 100 Jinsinsari of Munsubosal and enshrined them at Yangsan Tongdosa Temple, Odaesan Sangwonsa Temple, Seoraksan Bongjeongam, Jeongseon Jeongamsa Temple and Beopheungsa Temple while establishing Jeongmyeolbogung, Hall of Buddha, at each of the places. Inside the Jeongmyeolbogung there is no statue of Buddha and only a wide open window. This is because it is believed that the mountain as a whole is the enshrined Jinsinsari of Buddha himself.<br><br>Beopheungsa was once a large temple where over 2,000 monks gathered. Today, most of the temple buildings were lost to a number of fires leaving only a few buildings. The pine wood path from Beopheungsa Temple to Jeongmyeolbogung is one of the most picturesque sites in the nation. The location was originally named Sajasansa but later changed to Sajasan Jeongmyeolbogung in 1939. In addition to the path, the nine peaks (Gubongdae) lined up one after another forms another charming view.","regDate":"2022-10-19","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-19-1666161866197/2370006_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-19-1666161866197"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
