The area is often called Goseokjeong, named after the nearby Goseokjeong Pavilion. The area is an important geology and topography learning site where it is visible to see the topography before the formation of the basalt lava field and the fact that the basalt lava flowed over the bedrock to form the lava field. Goseok is a bedrock that existed before the area of Cheorwon was covered with lava, and is a granite formed underground about 110 million years ago (mid Cretaceous period). It is covered in basalt lava by volcanic activity that occurred between about 540,000 and 120,000 years ago, and then eroded by the Hantangang River to form a new waterway.&nbsp;\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-33-450-4810|\n|restdate:|Security tour does not operate on Tuesdays and during Seollal (Lunar New Year's Day) & Chuseok (Korean Thanksgiving Day) holidays|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-09-27-1664269269598/2609754_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-27-1664269269598/2609754_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-27-1664269269598/2675250_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-27-1664269269598/2675250_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-27-1664269269598/2675251_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-27-1664269269598/2675251_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-33-450-4810](tel:+82334504810)\n- [üè†www.hantangeopark.kr](http://www.hantangeopark.kr/bbs/content.php?co_id=sight_01_04)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 38.1872292046\nlongitude: 127.2889996684\ntitle: 1825 , Taebong-ro, Cheorwon-gun, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-09-27-1664269269598","title":"Hantangang River [National Geopark] (ÌïúÌÉÑÍ∞ï(Íµ≠Í∞ÄÏßÄÏßàÍ≥µÏõê, Í≥†ÏÑùÏ†ï))","description":"Goseok Rock, located in the area of Hantangang River, is a granite rock that reach 15 meters in x_height.

At that time, Preceptor Jinghyo earned 100 Jinsinsari of Munsubosal and enshrined them at Yangsan Tongdosa Temple, Odaesan Sangwonsa Temple, Seoraksan Bongjeongam, Jeongseon Jeongamsa Temple and Beopheungsa Temple while establishing Jeongmyeolbogung, Hall of Buddha, at each of the places. Inside the Jeongmyeolbogung there is no statue of Buddha and only a wide open window. This is because it is believed that the mountain as a whole is the enshrined Jinsinsari of Buddha himself.<br><br>Beopheungsa was once a large temple where over 2,000 monks gathered. Today, most of the temple buildings were lost to a number of fires leaving only a few buildings. The pine wood path from Beopheungsa Temple to Jeongmyeolbogung is one of the most picturesque sites in the nation. The location was originally named Sajasansa but later changed to Sajasan Jeongmyeolbogung in 1939.
