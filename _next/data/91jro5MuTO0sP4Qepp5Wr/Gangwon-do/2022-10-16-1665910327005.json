The word ‚Äúdae‚Äù in Uisangdae refers to a building built at a vantage point for areas with beautiful scenery. Indeed, the view of the East Sea and the coast from Uisangdae Pavilion awarded its recognition as one of the Eight Sights of Yangyang, and a must-visit place for all visitors to Naksansa Temple. Jeong Cheol (pen-name  Songgang), a famed scholar and writer of the poem Song of Diamond Mountains, chose the pavilion as one of the Eight Sights of Gwandong, and the pavilion is today one of the popular sites for sunrise-viewing on the east coast of Korea. Together with Hongnyeonam Hermitage, it is designated as the Scenic Site No. 27 of Korea under the name ‚ÄúUisangdae Pavilion and Hongnyeonam Hermitage of Naksansa Temple, Yangyang.‚Äù Uisangdae is named after Uisang, a respected Silla-era Buddhist monk who is said to have founded this temple in 671 (11th year of King Munmu‚Äôs reign of Silla), and many stories of his deeds can still be found in the temple. For instance, Uisangdae is said to be the site where he meditated before founding Naksansa Temple at its present site. Today‚Äôs pavilion was restored to its present hexagonal form in 1995.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-33-672-2447|\n|opendate:|In 1995|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Summer season 04:00‚Äì20:00 / Winter season 05:30‚Äì18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Film Locations:|Filming site of the TV Show Taejo Wang Geon|\n|Available Facilities:|Uisangdae Pavilion, Naksansa Temple|\n|Activity Fees:|[Entrance Fees to Naksansa Temple‚Äôs Cultural Heritage]<br> Individual: Adults 4,000 won / Teenagers 1,500 won / Children 1,000 won<br> Group: Adult 3,000 won / Teenagers 1,000 won / Children 700 won|\n|Parking Fees:|4,000 won|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|None|\n|Reservation Info. for Foreigners:|None|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-10-16-1665910327005/483706_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-16-1665910327005/483706_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-16-1665910327005/483710_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-16-1665910327005/483710_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-16-1665910327005/678000_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-16-1665910327005/678000_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-16-1665910327005/678019_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-16-1665910327005/678019_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-16-1665910327005/678020_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-16-1665910327005/678020_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-16-1665910327005/2356894_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-16-1665910327005/2356894_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-16-1665910327005/678021_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-16-1665910327005/678021_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-16-1665910327005/678022_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-16-1665910327005/678022_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-16-1665910327005/2356912_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-16-1665910327005/2356912_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-33-672-2447](tel:+82336722447)\n- [üè†www.naksansa.or.kr](http://www.naksansa.or.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 38.1253701685\nlongitude: 128.6307430562\ntitle: 100, Naksansa-ro, Yangyang-gun, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Yangyang Intercity Bus Terminal Bus Stop, take Bus No. 9 and get off at Naksansa Temple Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-10-16-1665910327005","title":"Uisangdae Pavilion (ÎÇôÏÇ∞ÏÇ¨ ÏùòÏÉÅÎåÄ)","description":"This pavilion is located on a seaside cliff on the way from Yangyang‚Äôs Naksansa Temple to Gwaneumgul Cave of Hongnyeonam Hermitage.

At that time, Preceptor Jinghyo earned 100 Jinsinsari of Munsubosal and enshrined them at Yangsan Tongdosa Temple, Odaesan Sangwonsa Temple, Seoraksan Bongjeongam, Jeongseon Jeongamsa Temple and Beopheungsa Temple while establishing Jeongmyeolbogung, Hall of Buddha, at each of the places. Inside the Jeongmyeolbogung there is no statue of Buddha and only a wide open window. This is because it is believed that the mountain as a whole is the enshrined Jinsinsari of Buddha himself.<br><br>Beopheungsa was once a large temple where over 2,000 monks gathered. Today, most of the temple buildings were lost to a number of fires leaving only a few buildings. The pine wood path from Beopheungsa Temple to Jeongmyeolbogung is one of the most picturesque sites in the nation. The location was originally named Sajasansa but later changed to Sajasan Jeongmyeolbogung in 1939.
