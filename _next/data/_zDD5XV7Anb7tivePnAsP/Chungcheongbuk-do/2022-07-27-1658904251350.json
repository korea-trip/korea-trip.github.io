Also, Unseongugok Valley flows in front of Sainam Rock. The rock was picked as the most picturesque place among the Eight Scenic Views. On the cliff, there is a phrase carved by  Utak’s own handwriting, as well as old pine trees on a rock floor that is  reminiscent of the Haegeumgang River. <br><br> Sainam was named after the great scholar Yeokdong Utak during Goryeo Period. He had taken up a public service to assist a king  in a position called <i>sain</i> (사인), and then he retired to his hometown  of Danyang, starting out teaching young students. For this story, a governor of Danyang named the rock Sainam to commemorate his achievement during King Seongjong of  the Joseon Dynasty.","regDate":"2022-10-28","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongbuk-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Valleys"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-28-1666953894541/2032243_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Chungcheongbuk-do/2022-10-28-1666953894541"},{"id":"2022-10-28-1666950234793","title":"Ondal Resort & Open Film Set (온달관광지 온달드라마 세트장)","description":"Ondal Tourist Park features many attractions and facilities, including an exhibition hall, fortress, and cave, all designed around the legendary love story of General Ondal and Princess Pyeonggang.
