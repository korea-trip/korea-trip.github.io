Meaning “lake as clear as a mountain well,” Sanjeonghosu Lake was built as a reservoir to supply water to farmlands in 1925. Thanks to its surrounding attractions, the lake brings many visitors each year. Promenades along the lake are popular for couples as well as tourists who stay in the nearby hotels. <br><br>\n\nBeautiful fog often rises from the lake in spring and fall, making boating at night quite picturesque. Hikers frequent Myeongseongsan Mountain in spring and fall. Visitors love skating on the lake in winter. The lake is also surrounded by an amusement park, swimming pools, sledding facilities, and spa amenities, attracting many family visitors. Local restaurants are renowned for their delicious, wholesome dishes made using freshwater snails and mushrooms. Other local favorites include <em>maeuntang</em> (spicy fish stew), <em>dotorimuk</em> (acorn jelly), <em>sanchae baekban</em> (Korean set menu with seasoned wild vegetables), and <em>deodeok gui</em> (grilled bonnet bellflower roots).\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-31-532-6135|\n|parking:|Available|\n|usetime:|N/A (open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Night-time Hike Restriction Notice:|Admission is strictly prohibited from sunset until 2 hours before sunrise for visitors’ safety and natural environment protection.|\n|Areas Open to the Public:|Sanjeonghosu Lake Tourist Site<br>Myeongseongsan Mountain trekking trails|\n|Hiking Course:|[Myeongseongsan Mountain] <br>Course 1: Sangdong Parking Lot > Biseon Falls > Deungryong Falls > Reed Field > Palgakjeong Pavilion > Mountain Top <br>Course 2: Sangdong Parking Lot > Biseon Falls > Chaekbawi Rock > Palgakjeong Pavilion > Mountain Top<br>Course 3: Jainsa Temple > Stone Stairs > Parting ways > Wooden Stairs > Palgakjeong Pavilion > Mountain Top<br>Course 4: Sanangogae Hill > Valley > Branch Ridge (left side) > Mountain Top|\n|Available Facilities:|* Sports Facilities – boatyard, sledding facilities, amusement park, skating rink<br>* Amenities – picnic grounds<br>* Special facilities- sculpture park|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Small vehicles: 2,000 won <br>Mid-sized vehicles: 5,000 won<br>Large vehicles: 10,000 won|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Not available|\n|Korean Info.
