The forest boasts a striking landscape of thick groves of trees and a view overlooking the Namhangang River. During some mornings, the forest‚Äôs log cabins are veiled by a thick fog, further adding to the beautiful natural ambience.\n<br><br>\nRising 834 meters above sea level, Jungmisan Mountain is a popular sunrise destination frequented by throngs of hikers every year. Thick forests of pine trees create a rooftop of branches from spring to fall. Being surrounded by the tall mountains of Baegunsan, Yumyeongsan, and Yongmunsan, Jungmisan Mountain feels like it is in the inner mountainous region of Gangwon-do, although it is close to Seoul.\n<br><br>\nThe forest has log cabins that can accommodate groups of 4 to 10 people as well as campsites that complement the surrounding natural environment. Visitors can enjoy a comfortable walk through the trees on a trail that winds through the heart of the forest.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Korea Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-31-771-7166|\n|opendate:|1991|\n|useseason:|March-November|\n|usetime:|[Daily] 09:00-18:00<br>[Accommodation] Check in - From 15:00 / Check out - 12:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Accommodations<BR>Convenience facilities - walking trail, hiking trail, forest park. etc. <br> Education facilities - Forest experience course<br>Sports facility - playground <br>Drinking fountain|\n|Facility Utilization Fees:|[Accommodations] <BR>Forest Cabin: 46,000~184,000 won<br>Lodging Complex: 77,000~134,000 won <BR>Camping Facility: 6,000~8,500 won<BR>* For detailed information, check the official website|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-29-1661769914101/607979_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661769914101/607979_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-29-1661769914101/607983_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661769914101/607983_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-29-1661769914101/607987_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661769914101/607987_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-29-1661769914101/607992_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661769914101/607992_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-29-1661769914101/608001_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661769914101/608001_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-29-1661769914101/608005_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661769914101/608005_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-29-1661769914101/608009_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661769914101/608009_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-29-1661769914101/608018_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661769914101/608018_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-29-1661769914101/1589830_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661769914101/1589830_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-29-1661769914101/607974_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661769914101/607974_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-31-771-7166](tel:+82317717166)\n- [üè†www.foresttrip.go.kr](https://www.foresttrip.go.kr/indvz/main.do?hmpgId=0108)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5818000399\nlongitude: 127.4571548101\ntitle: 1152, Jungmisan-ro, Yangpyeong-gun, Gyeonggi-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-29-1661769914101","title":"Jungmisan Recreational Forest (Ï§ëÎØ∏ÏÇ∞ÏûêÏó∞Ìú¥ÏñëÎ¶º)","description":"Jungmisan Recreational Forest unfolds at the end of a lovely drive along the famous Nongdachigogae Road, the highest ridge road in the vicinity of Seoul.
