It was also called Jallokgae by residents and female divers in the area. \n<br><br>\nThe construction of Oryukdo Skywalk began on September 12, 2012 at the Seungdumal area, which is regarded as the dividing point between the East Sea and the South Sea, and the skywalk opened on October 18, 2013, with the theme of \"walking over the sky.”\n<br><br>\nIron columns were set up over a 35-meter-high coastal cliff, and a 15-meter glass bridge comprised of 24 glass plates and shaped like a horse’s hoof connect the iron columns. The glass flooring was made by four layers of 12-millimeter glass panels coated with a bulletproof film for a total thickness of 55.49 millimeters, making the structure quite safe. Visitors will be thrilled with the view of the waves while looking down through the transparent floor. The sea stretches out ahead of the skywalk, perfect for a photo op.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-51-607-6395,<br> +82-51-607-4937|\n|opendate:|October 18, 2013|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)<br>(Note: closed in the case of rain or strong wind, and during periods of repairing and improving facility)|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00 (Last admission 17:50)<br>* Operating hours subject to change in the case of adverse weather|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Film Locations:|Movie \"Tidal Wave (2009)\"|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-18-1660797906915/2026246_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-18-1660797906915/2026246_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-18-1660797906915/2026250_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-18-1660797906915/2026250_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-18-1660797906915/2026255_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-18-1660797906915/2026255_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-18-1660797906915/2026257_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-18-1660797906915/2026257_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-18-1660797906915/2617618_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-18-1660797906915/2617618_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-18-1660797906915/2617619_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-18-1660797906915/2617619_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-18-1660797906915/2617620_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-18-1660797906915/2617620_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-18-1660797906915/2622803_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-18-1660797906915/2622803_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-18-1660797906915/2026247_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-18-1660797906915/2026247_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-51-607-6395](tel:+82516076395)\n- [🏠www.bsnamgu.go.kr](https://www.bsnamgu.go.kr/index.namgu?menuCd=DOM_000000116000000000)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.1022800177\nlongitude: 129.1229377062\ntitle: 137, Oryukdo-ro, Nam-gu, Busan\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Local Bus]<br>\nFrom Busan Station (Busan Subway Line 1), Exit 10, take Bus No. 27 and get off at Oryukdo SK View Humun (Backgate) Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-18-1660797906915","title":"Oryukdo Skywalk (오륙도 스카이워크)","description":"Oryukdo Skywalk is located at what was called Seungdumal, meaning a saddle, due to the shape of the point.
