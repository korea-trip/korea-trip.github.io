Built in 824 A.D. (during the 16th year of King Heondeok‚Äôs reign), the temple was destroyed during the Japanese Invasions of Korea (1592-1598) and rebuilt in 1674 (during the 15th year of King Hyeongjong‚Äôs reign). Since then, it has gone through rebuilding several times. Consisting of 30 buildings, the temple is home to many Buddhist nuns.<br><br> \n\nSeongnamsa Three Story Pagoda (Local Tangible Cultural Property No. 5) was built in 824 A.D. by Monk Doui, reflecting his wish of protecting the country from foreign invasions. The pagoda was initially placed in front of Daeungjeon, but moved to the current location in 1973.
