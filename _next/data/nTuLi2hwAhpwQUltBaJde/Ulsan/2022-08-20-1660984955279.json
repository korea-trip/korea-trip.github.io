The 47.54-kilometer-long river passes through downtown Ulsan and empties out into Ulsan Bay on the East Sea. Not just a symbol of pride for the people of Ulsan, the river has long since been a precious commodity that has played a pivotal role in Ulsan culture and history. There are several attractions and amenities near the river such as a bamboo forest park, grassy fields, a pampas grass colony, trails, and exercise facilities. The river itself is home to many freshwater fish, while the riverside area is a famous habitat for migratory birds.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-52-120|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-20-1660984955279/1588268_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-20-1660984955279/1588268_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-20-1660984955279/1588269_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-20-1660984955279/1588269_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-20-1660984955279/1588270_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-20-1660984955279/1588270_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-20-1660984955279/1588271_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-20-1660984955279/1588271_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-20-1660984955279/1588273_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-20-1660984955279/1588273_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-20-1660984955279/2617085_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-20-1660984955279/2617085_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-20-1660984955279/2617086_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-20-1660984955279/2617086_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-20-1660984955279/1588267_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-20-1660984955279/1588267_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-20-1660984955279/1588272_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-20-1660984955279/1588272_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-52-120](tel:+8252120)\n- [🏠tour.ulsan.go.kr](http://tour.ulsan.go.kr/index.ulsan)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.5486691244\nlongitude: 129.2873637765\ntitle: Mugeo-dong, Nam-gu, Ulsan\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Local Bus]<br>\nTake Bus No. 317, 402, 421, 422, 426, 442, 802, 807 \nor 817 to Taehwagang River.\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-20-1660984955279","title":"Taehwagang River (태화강)","description":"Taehwagang River cuts across the city of Ulsan from the west to east and originates from Tapgolsaem Spring on Baegunsan Mountain.
