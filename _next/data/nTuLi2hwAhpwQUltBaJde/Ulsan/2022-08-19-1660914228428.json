It was built under the leadership of Japanese General Kato Kiyomasa  in \n1592-1593 at the beginning of the Imjinwaeran War (Japanese invasion, 1592-1598). The main fortress is located on a mountaintop 200 meters above \nsea level, a  second fortress is halfway down the mountain, and a  third fortress is \nlocated at the bottom of the mountain. The  whole fortress is rectangular shaped. The fortress wall is 6 meters high and slants at an angle of 15 degrees.<br> \n\n<br>In 1594, a Buddhist monk named&nbsp;Samyeong-daesa came to Seosaengpo Waeseong Fortress four times to negotiate for peace, but he failed each time. In 1598, the fortress was taken over \nby Korea with the assistance of General Magwi of the Ming dynasty. A year later, Changpyodang Shrine was built in honor of 53 Koreans \nwho died during battles against the Japanese invading forces. However, the shrine was destroyed during the Japanese imperialism period and no \ntrace of it remains. It is possible to tell from Seosaengpo Jinseongdo (a map drawn up in 1872) that the fortress was also partially used by  Korean forces.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-52-204-0324|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-19-1660914228428/530629_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-19-1660914228428/530629_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-19-1660914228428/530631_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-19-1660914228428/530631_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-52-204-0324](tel:+82522040324)\n- [🏠tour.ulju.ulsan.kr</a> (Korean only)<br><a href=\"http://www.cha.go.kr/\" target=\"_blank\">www.cha.go.kr](http://tour.ulju.ulsan.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.3832802498\nlongitude: 129.3343448775\ntitle: Seosaeng-ri, Seosaeng-myeon, Ulju-gun, Ulsan-si\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Seoul Express Terminal, take a bus to Ulsan Bus Terminal.<br> Across from Ulsan Express/Intercity Bus Terminal, take Bus No. 715 and get off at Seosaengpo \nJapanese Fortress Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-19-1660914228428","title":"Seosaengpo Waeseong Fortress (서생포왜성)","description":"Seosaengpo Waeseong Fortress (Seosaengpo Japanese Fortress) is a  stone fortress typical of the Japanese style popular in the later part of the 16th century.

The tale is about a dragon that emerged from the east sea along with his seven sons at the end of the Silla Kingdom (57BC - 935AD). One of the dragon’s sons named Cheoyong came to the capital and married a beautiful woman. One night, he found an evil spirit trying to attack his wife so he sang and danced, whereupon the spirit presented itself and kneeled in apology. Since then, people have used the image of Cheoyong to dispel evil spirits. <br><br>The dance that Cheoyong is said to have performed has been titled Cheoyongmu and has been designated as an Important Intangible Cultural Property.
