It is known that the mountain was named Palbong (‚Äúeight peaks‚Äù in Korean) because of its eight peaks standing in a row. There are actually nine peaks, but the smallest was not included. Legend says the smallest weeps over its exclusion at the end of every December. The third peak is the highest, standing at 362 meters with a beautiful view and crisp air, making it ideal for hiking (3-hour course) and resting at the top. There is another mountain of the same name in Hongcheon, so this mountain is usually referred to as ‚ÄúSeosan Palbongsan.‚Äù\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <BR>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-41-662-2004|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Hiking Course:|Seosan Terminal - Yanggil Parking lot - water fountain - Nojeokbong Peak - Site of Unamsa Temple / cloud ladder - Site of Cheonje / heliport - Sangbong Peak - Jeotgarakbawi Rock - Sanigogae / Seotaesa - Daemundari Bridge |\n|Restricted Mountain Areas :|[Refer to the website.](http://hiking.kworks.co.kr/sub_map/map_user01.aspx)|\n|Mountain Not Access Period:|Seasonal Forest Fire Prevention Period<br>Spring: March 2 - April 30 <br>Autumn: November 1 - December 15<br>National Park: November 15 - December 15 (Excluding Gyeongju and Taean)<br>* Periods and areas are subject to change based on fire weather advisories, snow/precipitation levels, and other local conditions.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-14-1668404666423/1919424_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-14-1668404666423/1919424_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-14-1668404666423/1919425_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-14-1668404666423/1919425_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-14-1668404666423/1919427_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-14-1668404666423/1919427_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-14-1668404666423/1919428_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-14-1668404666423/1919428_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-14-1668404666423/1919429_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-14-1668404666423/1919429_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-14-1668404666423/1919431_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-14-1668404666423/1919431_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-14-1668404666423/1919433_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-14-1668404666423/1919433_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-41-662-2004](tel:+82416622004)\n- [üè†www.seosan.go.kr](http://www.seosan.go.kr/tour/index.do)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.8042375084\nlongitude: 126.3753578467\ntitle: Yanggil-ri, Seosan-si, Chungcheongnam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>\nFrom Seoul Nambu Terminal or Central City Terminal, take a Bus to Seosan Bus Terminal. <br>\n\nFrom Seosan Bus Terminal Bus Stop, take Bus No. 700 (Eosong, Yanggil, Deoksong, Gudo, Hori, Eosong) and get  off at Palbong Elementary School Bus Stop. <BR>Transfer to Bus No. 704 (Eosong, Gudo, Deoksong, Palbongsan Mountain, Yanggil, Gonam2) and get off at Palbongsan Mountain Bus Stop.<BR> Walk for approx. 720m.\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-14-1668404666423","title":"Seosan Palbongsan Mountain (ÌåîÎ¥âÏÇ∞(ÏÑúÏÇ∞))","description":"Palbongsan Mountain stretches out like a folding screen and stands high with great spirit.

There are few existing records that mention the temple‚Äôs beginning. Some suggest that it was built around AD 527 during the 5th year of Baekje King Seongwang‚Äôs reign, but there is little evidence to support this theory. The only reference alluding to a specific time is Yeojidoseo (Detailed Survey of Korean Geography published during the late Joseon dynasty). It states Jeongamsa Temples location as on Oseosan Mountain, and Oseosan Mountain being surrounded by Hongsan Mountain and Baegwolsan Mountain and intersected by Hongju, Gyeolseong, and Boryeong. This indicates the temple was recognized in the mid-18th century and around the same time, Garamgo (a book about temples, published in the late 18th century) also states that Jeongamsa Temple is located approximately 11 kilometers to the east of Gyeolseonghyeon. It is still uncertain whether the temple referred to is Jeongamsa Temple on Oseosan Mountain. <br>Some foundation stones within the temple site measure 70-80 centimeters on each side. These stones indicate that the old Buddhist shrine of Jeongamsa Temple was laid out with five <em>kan</em> (Korean unit of measurement indicating the space between two pilars) at the front and three kan on the side. Future archaeological studies will help identify the true history of Jeongamsa Temple.","regDate":"2022-11-20","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Chungcheongnam-do/2022-11-20-1668919580082"},{"id":"2022-11-20-1668916695189","title":"Gongseri Catholic Church (ÏïÑÏÇ∞ Í≥µÏÑ∏Î¶¨ÏÑ±Îãπ)","description":"Gongseri Catholic Church was founded in 1894 as the main parish of the Daejeon diocese in Gongse-ri, Inju-myeon that connects Asanman Bay to Sapgyocheon Stream.

This was the first Catholic church in Chungcheongnam-do and the religion spread across Anseong, Onyang, and Dunpo to establish regional churches respectively. The grounds have three graves of prosecuted martyrs, a parish and rectory, retreat house, and meeting room.
