{"pageProps":{"content":"![Baenaegol Valley (Î∞∞ÎÇ¥Í≥®)](/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228175_image2_1.webp)\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> Baenaegol Valley is located at the heart of the mountainous region affectionately known as the Yeongnam Alps. The valley derives its name ‚ÄúBaenaegol,‚Äù meaning ‚Äúthe valley of pears,‚Äù from the wild pear trees that grow in large numbers along the valley.<br><br>\n\nThe valley covers nearly 8 kilometers of land between the range connecting Sinbulsan Mountain and Yeongchuksan Mountain and the western range connecting Cheonhwangsan Mountain and Jaeyaksan Mountain in Miryang. It is a popular vacation destination in the summer. Also, many tourists come to drink the water containing acer mono sap, which is known to be produced in this region during the springtime.\n<br><br>\nBaenaegol Valley is just a short distance away from downtown Yangsan. The valley provides an opportunity to enjoy nature away from the hustle and bustle of the city center. The long valley is wedged between highlands, which results in at least two hours less of sunshine than other regions, so it feels cooler in the summer months. Strawberries are also widely grown in the area.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-55-382-4112|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228158_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228158_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228159_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228159_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228163_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228163_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228166_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228166_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228185_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228185_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228187_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228187_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-55-382-4112](tel:+82553824112)\n- [üè†www.yangsan.go.kr](http://www.yangsan.go.kr/tour)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.4564540524\nlongitude: 128.9660138589\ntitle: Wondong-myeon, Yangsan-si, Gyeongsangnam-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-30-1659163505785","title":"Baenaegol Valley (Î∞∞ÎÇ¥Í≥®)","description":"Baenaegol Valley is located at the heart of the mountainous region affectionately known as the Yeongnam Alps.

Before reaching the valley, the water joins the currents from Sinbatgol, Jogaegol, and Bambatgol Valleys.

Chokseongnu (historically known as ‚ÄòJangwollu‚Äô) has undergone eight renovations since its establishment in the 28th year of King Gojong (1241, Goryeo dynasty) and was once used as a commanding post for defending Jinju Palace in times of war. During times of peace, it was used for holding state examinations. <br><br>Although the structure was burnt down during the Korean War, it was restored in 1960 through the efforts of the Jinju Historical Site Preservation Society. The roof design features a mix of hipped and gabled styles and the stone pillars were built with rocks collected from Chokseoksan Mountain, located in Changwon-si. The wood used for the structure was brought from Odaesan Mountain, situated in Gangwon-do. Noticeable features of Chokseongnu are the four engraved signboards and a board that holds the works of renowned poets and calligraphers. Jinju Namgang Yudeung (Lantern) Festival is held every fall at the Jinjuseong Fortress.","regDate":"2022-07-30","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-30-1659199947652/2367499_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-07-30-1659199947652"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
