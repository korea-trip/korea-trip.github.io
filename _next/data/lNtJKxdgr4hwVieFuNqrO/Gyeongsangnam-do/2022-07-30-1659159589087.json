This valley is Baegundonggyegok Valley.  For almost 6 km, the water of the valley flows over only rocks, with over twenty large and small falls and lakes.  Large stones in the valley are gorgeous because the stones are washed with sunbeams and the strong current of water.  The most famous falls are Baeunpokpo Waterfall and Odampokpo Waterfall.  Strong current of water flows in Deungcheondae, where the letters ‚ÄòYeongnamjeilcheonsok‚Äô are carved.  Baegundonggyegok Valley is a clean area due to maintenance of the clean natural environment.
