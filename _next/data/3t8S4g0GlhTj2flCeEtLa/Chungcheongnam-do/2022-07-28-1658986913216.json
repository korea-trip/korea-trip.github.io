His house is the oldest private residence in Korea, and was originally General Choi Yeong‚Äôs home, before he turned it over to his grand son-in-law, Maeng Sa-seong. The simple residence houses two 600-year-old gingko trees in the yard. Therefore it has been named ‚ÄòHaengdan‚Äô, meaning that Confucius taught on top of the gingko tree symbolizing a place of learning. For that reason it is inferred that Maeng Sa-seong intentionally planted gingko trees in the yard and taught junior scholars. The two gingko trees provide a cool shade and give out five sacks of gingko nuts each year.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-41-536-8773|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|House, exhibition hall, etc.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-28-1658986913216/1495721_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1658986913216/1495721_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1658986913216/1495724_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1658986913216/1495724_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1658986913216/1495726_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1658986913216/1495726_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1658986913216/1495730_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1658986913216/1495730_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1658986913216/1495733_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1658986913216/1495733_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1658986913216/1495734_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1658986913216/1495734_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1658986913216/1495740_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1658986913216/1495740_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1658986913216/1495745_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1658986913216/1495745_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1658986913216/1495747_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1658986913216/1495747_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1658986913216/1495748_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1658986913216/1495748_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-41-536-8773](tel:+82415368773)\n- [üè†www.cha.go.kr](http://www.cha.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.7469751625\nlongitude: 127.0419991490\ntitle: 23-4, Haengdan-gil, Asan-si, Chungcheongnam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>\nFrom Dong Seoul Bus Terminal, take a bus to Asan Bus Terminal. \n<br>From Asan Bus Terminal Bus Stop, take Bus No. 170, 171, 172, 174 or 175 and get \noff at Asan Maengssi Haengdan House Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-28-1658986913216","title":"Asan Maengssi Haengdan House - Maeng Sa-seong House (ÏïÑÏÇ∞ ÎßπÏî®ÌñâÎã®(ÎßπÏÇ¨ÏÑ± Í≥†ÌÉù)","description":"Maeng Sa-seong is a major figure in Cheonbaek-ri and was a prime minister during the early years of the Joseon dynasty.
