Starting with Chungbuksikdang Restaurant (opened in 1979), livelihood-motivated restaurants and eateries serving marinated gopchang (intestines) began opening up here since the end of the IMF crisis in 1998 until it reached its current size today. Locals enjoy coming to the area because of the affordable prices. Recently, the area is also trying to draw in a younger demographic by targeting the younger population. In 2012, Anjirang Gopchang Alley was selected as one of the top five food themed streets in the nation by the Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism.","regDate":"2022-07-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Daegu","Culture/Art/History","Experience Programs","Cultural Districts"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-13-1657690737111/2363737_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Daegu/2022-07-13-1657690737111","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Daegu/2022-07-13-1657690737111"},{"id":"2022-07-13-1657685488151","title":"Ancient Tombs in Bullo-dong (ÎåÄÍµ¨ Î∂àÎ°úÎèô Í≥†Î∂ÑÍµ∞)","description":"About 200 tombs are located on a hillock in Bullo-dong, Dong-gu near Geumhogang River.
