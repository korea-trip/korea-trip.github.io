The two major islands of Dokdo are named Dongdo Island, located at a latitude of 37&deg;14N and a longitude of 131&deg;52E, and Seodo Island, located at a latitude of 37&deg;14N and a longitude of 131&deg;51E. Designated as a Natural Monument, Dokdo Island is a protected natural reserve that serves as a home to several rare and endangered bird species. Civilian access to Dokdo Island was prohibited in accordance with Article 33 of Cultural Heritage Protection Act until March 24, 2005, when adjustments were made with the law, granting the public access to Dongdo and Seodo Islands under certain conditions. Since then, continuous adjustments have been made, such as abolishing the number restriction of daily visitors, allowing more visitors to appreciate the beauty of Dokdo Island. <br /><br />Dongdo Island, located on the southeastern coast, has a circumference of 2.8 kilometers and a surface area of 73,297 „é° with its highest peak reaching 98.6 meters. It also has a lighthouse and a wharf along with other marine and fishery facilities. As for Seodo Island, located on the northwestern coast, it has a circumference of 2.6 kilometers and a surface area of 88,740 „é° with the highest peak reaching 168.5 meters. Seodo Island houses living quarters of Dokdo Islands residents, where fishers seek shelter in case of an emergency. Several uniquely shaped rock formations are scattered surrounding the two major islands, such as Gajaebawi Rock, Chotdaebawi Rock, and Eolgulbawi Rock to name a few. The total surface area of all the rocks combined is 25,517 „é°.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-54-790-6644|\n|restdate:|* Cruise may not operate during adverse weather|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|Free<BR> * Fees vary by cruise|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-23-1669199979050/1860546_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-23-1669199979050/1860546_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-23-1669199979050/1860553_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-23-1669199979050/1860553_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-23-1669199979050/2653417_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-23-1669199979050/2653417_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-23-1669199979050/2653418_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-23-1669199979050/2653418_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-23-1669199979050/2556237_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-23-1669199979050/2556237_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-54-790-6644](tel:+82547906644)\n- [üè†dokdo.mofa.go.kr</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.dokdo.go.kr/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"web\">www.dokdo.go.kr](http://dokdo.mofa.go.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.2394438998\nlongitude: 131.8692557526\ntitle: 55, Dokdoisabu-gil, Ulleung-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-23-1669199979050","title":"Dokdo Island (ÎèÖÎèÑ)","description":"Located 87.4 kilometers away from Ulleungdo Island, Dokdo Island is an isolated group of volcanic islands and rocks on the east coast of Korea.

Joseon-era Confucian scholar Toegye Yi Hwang (1501-1570) was inspired by the scenery of the valley and the enchanting sound of the flowing water, so he came up with names for each of the nine sections of the valley and collectively called them Jukgyegugok (nine bamboo valleys). The valley presents a splendid sight indeed with crystal clear waters, lush forest, and white rocks. In summer, vacationers from around the country flock to Jukgyegugok Valley to cool off from the sweltering heat by dipping their feet in the refreshing waters of the valley. Famous tourist attractions near the valley include Sosuseowon Confucian Academy, Buseoksa Temple, and Eupnaeri Mural Tomb.<br><br>* Choamsa Temple<br>On the path that ascends from Jukgyegugok Valley, there is a small temple located at the foot of Sobaeksan Mountain. The great monk Uisang Daesa of the Silla Kingdom reached this place during his search for an ideal site to build a Buddhist temple invoking national security. He set up a small thatched hut for a temporary stay until he found the most propitious spot, on which he built Buseoksa Temple. In the site where his thatched hut once stood, he built another temple and named it Choamsa Temple. The original structure was destroyed by fire during the Korean War (1950-1953). The temple has been restored to its present state by the Buddhist monk Lee Bo-won after years of arduous efforts.","regDate":"2022-12-02","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Valleys"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-02-1669973794677/2376704_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-02-1669973794677"},{"id":"2022-12-02-1669970358512","title":"Jukbyeonhang Port (Ï£ΩÎ≥ÄÌï≠)","description":"Jukbyeonhang Port is a fishing port in northern Uljin.
