It was moved to its current location in Byeongsan by a well-respected Confucian scholar named Yu Seong-nyong, penname Seoae, in 1572.<br><br>\n\nWhen Yu Seong-nyong passed away in 1607, many of his followers and other renowned scholars commemorated the late Confucian scholar by building Jondeoksa Shrine to enshrine his ancestral tablet in 1613, followed by renaming of the institution to Byeongsanseowon in 1614. Yu Seong-nyong's ancestral tablet was later moved to Yeogangseowon to be placed together with the ancestral tablet of Toegye Yi Hwang. In 1629, another ancestral tablet of the late scholar was made and housed in Jondeoksa Shrine. <br><br>\n\nIn 1863, Byeongsanseowon was recognized by the king to receive support as a private Confucian academy. The lecture hall and shrine were reconstructed in 1921 and 1937 respectively as part of preservation efforts made during the Japanese occupation. This academy is designated as Historic Site No. 260, housing a collection of 1,000 documents and 3,000 books, including works by Yu Seong-nyong.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <BR>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-54-858-5929, <BR>+82-54-853-0109|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-29-1659109574446/2601726_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659109574446/2601726_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659109574446/2601727_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659109574446/2601727_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659109574446/2601728_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659109574446/2601728_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659109574446/2601730_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659109574446/2601730_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659109574446/2601731_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659109574446/2601731_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659109574446/2620862_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659109574446/2620862_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659109574446/2620864_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659109574446/2620864_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659109574446/2620865_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659109574446/2620865_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659109574446/2620866_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659109574446/2620866_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659109574446/2620867_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659109574446/2620867_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è82-54-858-5929](tel:82548585929)\n- [üè†www.byeongsan.net](http://www.byeongsan.net)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.5404346397\nlongitude: 128.5527113867\ntitle: 386, Byeongsan-gil, Andong-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-29-1659109574446","title":"Byeongsanseowon Confucian Academy [UNESCO World Heritage] (Î≥ëÏÇ∞ÏÑúÏõê [Ïú†ÎÑ§Ïä§ÏΩî ÏÑ∏Í≥ÑÎ¨∏ÌôîÏú†ÏÇ∞])","description":"Before it became a Confucian academy, Byeongsanseowon Confucian Academy was originally located in Pungsang-hyeon under the name Pungakseodang School, which was used as a educational institution since the Goryeo dynasty by a political party known as the Sarim Party.

Joseon-era Confucian scholar Toegye Yi Hwang (1501-1570) was inspired by the scenery of the valley and the enchanting sound of the flowing water, so he came up with names for each of the nine sections of the valley and collectively called them Jukgyegugok (nine bamboo valleys). The valley presents a splendid sight indeed with crystal clear waters, lush forest, and white rocks. In summer, vacationers from around the country flock to Jukgyegugok Valley to cool off from the sweltering heat by dipping their feet in the refreshing waters of the valley. Famous tourist attractions near the valley include Sosuseowon Confucian Academy, Buseoksa Temple, and Eupnaeri Mural Tomb.<br><br>* Choamsa Temple<br>On the path that ascends from Jukgyegugok Valley, there is a small temple located at the foot of Sobaeksan Mountain. The great monk Uisang Daesa of the Silla Kingdom reached this place during his search for an ideal site to build a Buddhist temple invoking national security. He set up a small thatched hut for a temporary stay until he found the most propitious spot, on which he built Buseoksa Temple. In the site where his thatched hut once stood, he built another temple and named it Choamsa Temple. The original structure was destroyed by fire during the Korean War (1950-1953). The temple has been restored to its present state by the Buddhist monk Lee Bo-won after years of arduous efforts.","regDate":"2022-12-02","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Valleys"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-02-1669973794677/2376704_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-02-1669973794677"},{"id":"2022-12-02-1669970358512","title":"Jukbyeonhang Port (Ï£ΩÎ≥ÄÌï≠)","description":"Jukbyeonhang Port is a fishing port in northern Uljin.
