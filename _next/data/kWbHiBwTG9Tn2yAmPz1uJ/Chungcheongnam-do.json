The peninsula connected to Nammyeon was isolated during the Joseon Dynasty by cutting off access between Changgi-ri in Anmyeon-eup and Shinon-ri in Nammyeon for the convenience of tax transportation. The island's coast is lined with some 14 beaches as well as abundant pine trees, which are symbols of Anmyeon-eup. The island also owns Anmyeondo Natural Forest, along with the Mogamju Forest (Natural Monument No. 138).","regDate":"2022-07-28","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongnam-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-28-1658975944792/2426575_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Chungcheongnam-do/2022-07-28-1658975944792","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Chungcheongnam-do/2022-07-28-1658975944792"}],"metaData":{"pageUrl":"https://mcdryad.com/Chungcheongnam-do","nav":"Chungcheongnam-do"},"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
