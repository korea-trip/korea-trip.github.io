Due to its tough topography, Hansingyegok Valley has been less visited and thus still has rather untouched forests. Only hikers with stamina can trail the course from Baengmu-dong to Hansingyegok Valley to Seseok. During the summer season, the valley area is an optimal vacationing spot due to its thick forests and cold, clear water. It‚Äôs a great spot for seeing the autumn foliage and for hiking in the winter snow.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-55-970-1000|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Parking Fees:|*Up to first 1 hr: <br>Compact cars 500 won / mid to small sized cars 1,100 won / large vehicles 2,000 won<br>*After exceeding 1 hr limit (for every additional 10 min.): <br>Compact cars 100 won / mid to small sized cars 250-300 won / large vehicles 400-500 won<br><br>[Fixed rate] <br>Compact cars 2,000 won <br>mid to small sized cars 4,000~5,000 won <br>large vehicles 6,000~7,500 won <br>* Regular shuttle buses are exception (monthly parking users are charged separately.)|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-19-1671428172263/1978664_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-19-1671428172263/1978664_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-19-1671428172263/1978666_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-19-1671428172263/1978666_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-19-1671428172263/1978669_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-19-1671428172263/1978669_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-19-1671428172263/1978671_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-19-1671428172263/1978671_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-55-970-1000](tel:+82559701000)\n- [üè†http://jiri.knps.or.kr ](http://jiri.knps.or.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.3643829052\nlongitude: 127.6805736086\ntitle: Gangcheong-gil, Macheon-myeon, Hamyang-gun, Gyeongsangnam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \nFrom Dong Seoul Bus Terminal, take a bus to Hamyang Bus Terminal.\nFrom Hamyang Bus Terminal Bus Stop, take a bus headed for Baengmu-dong.\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-19-1671428172263","title":"Hansingyegok Valley (Baengmudonggyegok Valley) (ÌïúÏã†Í≥ÑÍ≥°(Î∞±Î¨¥ÎèôÍ≥ÑÍ≥°))","description":"Located in Hamyang-gun, Gyeongnam, Hansingyegok Valley starts from Chotdaebong Peak and Yeongsinbong Peak of Jirisan Mountain, runs down to meet with Hansinjigyegok Valley at Ganesopokpo Falls and continues on to Baengmu-dong.
