What started over 30 years ago as a private garden has expanded to cover the entire island in a plethora of plants in European-style gardens, accented by scultures and statues. The garden blooms in a riot of flowers in April, and visitors can walk in the cool shade of the forested trails in summer. Recently, dinosaur footprints were found on the island, adding to its value. The islands cafe offers drinks and light snacks, along with a fantastic view of Haegeumgang Island and the surrounding blue sea. Oedo-Botania is only accessable via a ferry tour, and there are no accommodations on the island.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-55-681-4541|\n|parking:|Available at ferry dock|\n|restdate:|Refer to the official website|\n|usetime:|Winter 08:30-17:00<br />Summer 08:00-19:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 11,000 won / Teenagers 8,000 won / Children 5,000 won<br>Groups - Teenagers 6,000 won / Children 4,000 won|\n|Available Facilities:|Themed gardens, observatory, rest area, walking paths, gift shop, etc.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-24-1671852964600/1784631_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-24-1671852964600/1784631_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-24-1671852964600/2612894_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-24-1671852964600/2612894_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-24-1671852964600/2612895_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-24-1671852964600/2612895_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-24-1671852964600/2612896_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-24-1671852964600/2612896_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-24-1671852964600/2612897_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-24-1671852964600/2612897_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-24-1671852964600/2612898_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-24-1671852964600/2612898_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-24-1671852964600/2612899_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-24-1671852964600/2612899_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-55-681-4541](tel:+82556814541)\n- [üè†www.oedobotania.com](http://www.oedobotania.com/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 34.7694763580\nlongitude: 128.7113935264\ntitle: 17, Oedo-gil, Geoje-si, Gyeongsangnam-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-24-1671852964600","title":"Oedo-Botania (Ïô∏ÎèÑ Î≥¥ÌÉÄÎãàÏïÑ)","description":"Oedo-Botania is a marine botanical garden located on an island in Hallyeohaesang National Park between Tongyeong and Geojedo Island.
