With its eight peaks, it is home to many temples and historic sites. The mountain also holds great importance in plant chorology as its forests consist of warm-temperate broad-leaved evergreens and deciduous broad-leaved trees. The mountain peak can be reached by trekking for about 2-3 hours from the entrance of Daeheungsa Temple or by the Daeryunsan Cable Car (one way 8-minute), which departs from the entrance on the opposite side of the mountain and takes visitors to a spot right below the peak. From the mountain summit, there is a view of the southern sea and on a clear day, it is possible to see as far as Hallasan Mountain on Jeju Island. Nearby tourist attractions include Uhangri Dinosaur Museum Complex, Usuyeong Tourism Village and Ttangkkeut Village.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-61-534-8992|\n|opendate:|August 13, 2010|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|Check the website for details|\n|usetime:|Summer 09:00-18:00 / Winter 09:00-17:00 <BR>* Closed during bad weather, call ahead for details.|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Tour Course Information:|[Daeheungsa Temple Course]<br>Haenam-eup - Historic Site of Gosan Yun Seon-do ‚Äì Birthplace of Go Jeong-hui ‚Äì Birthplace of Kim Nam-ju ‚Äì Duryunsan Cable Car ‚Äì Daeheungsa Temple ‚Äì Haenam-eup|\n|Film Locations:|Shooting location for KBS Happy Sunday \"Two Days and One Night\"|\n|Available Facilities:|Observatory|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Facility Utilization Fees:|[Round-trip]<br>Adults: 11,000 won / Group (over 30 people): 10,000 won<br>Children: 8,000 won<br><br>* Adults (middle school students and up), Children (ages 3-elementary school students) <br>* 1,000 won off for senior citizens (ages 65 and more)|\n|Reservation Info. for Foreigners:|On-site tickets only|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-18-1674027369493/1564561_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-18-1674027369493/1564561_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-18-1674027369493/1564573_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-18-1674027369493/1564573_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-18-1674027369493/1564589_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-18-1674027369493/1564589_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-18-1674027369493/1564594_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-18-1674027369493/1564594_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-18-1674027369493/1564605_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-18-1674027369493/1564605_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-18-1674027369493/1564607_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-18-1674027369493/1564607_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-18-1674027369493/1564617_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-18-1674027369493/1564617_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-18-1674027369493/1564562_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-18-1674027369493/1564562_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-18-1674027369493/1564563_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-18-1674027369493/1564563_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-18-1674027369493/1564570_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-18-1674027369493/1564570_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-61-534-8992](tel:+82615348992)\n- [üè†www.haenamcablecar.com](http://www.haenamcablecar.com)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 34.4968181405\nlongitude: 126.6253409902\ntitle: 88-45, Daeheungsa-gil, Haenam-gun, Jeollanam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Dong Seoul Bus Terminal or Seoul Central City Bus Terminal, take a bus to Haenam Bus Terminal.<br>\nFrom Haenam Bus Terminal Bus Stop, take a bus bound for Daeheungsa Temple and get off at Duryun Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-18-1674027369493","title":"Duryunsan Cable Car (ÎëêÎ•úÏÇ∞ÏºÄÏù¥Î∏îÏπ¥)","description":"Duryunsan Mountain (700 meters) is a famous mountain in Jeollanam-do.

The trademark image of the island is Jjangttungeo Bridge, a 470-meter-long wooden bridge built above the mud flat. The bridge allows visitors to observe mud creatures all without stepping foot in the mud. The jjangttungeo (mudskipper) is only able to live in clean mud flats and they are easily found in this island. The name of the bridge comes from the image of many mudskippers jumping around the bridge. During low tide, the vast mud flat appears, as well as various mud organisms including mudskippers, crabs, clams and lug worms. When the tide is high, crossing this bridge will give the feeling of walking on water. The sight seen from the bridge is perfect for a date course, and the bridge leads to Ujeong Beach, which offers a beautiful view of the setting sun.","regDate":"2023-01-24","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollanam-do","Culture/Art/History","Architectural Sights","Bridges"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-24-1674552966306/2612383_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollanam-do/2023-01-24-1674552966306"},{"id":"2023-01-24-1674549512720","title":"Jirisan National Park (Nogodan Peak Section) (ÏßÄÎ¶¨ÏÇ∞Íµ≠Î¶ΩÍ≥µÏõê (ÏßÄÎ¶¨ÏÇ∞ ÎÖ∏Í≥†Îã®))","description":"Jirisan National Park covers a vast amount of land in three provinces, including one city and three counties.
