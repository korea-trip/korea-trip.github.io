Seogwipo Submarine offers safe undersea tours in its recently acquired state of the art submarine from Finland. Munseom, where the submarine travels, is home to outstanding coral reefs, colorful schools of fish, and rich seaweed. The exquisite landscape makes it one of the most beautiful places to dive as well. Going deep into the 40 meter sea-bed, visitors can see countless fish, rare iridescent coral reefs, and a surreal-looking shipwreck with schools of fish surrounding it. Over 20 years of technical knowhow and safe operation (in fact, the longest submarine tour without a single accident on record) make Seogwipo Submarine a must-see attraction on Jeju Island.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-64-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-64-732-6060|\n|parking:|Available (buses 15 parking spaces, cars 70 parking spaces)|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|07:20 - 18:40 (Operates 18 times a day in 40 min intervals)<br>November-February operates until 16:00 <BR>July-August 07:45-18:50 (operates every 35 min.) <BR>* Operation subject to change|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Tour Course Information:|Route<br>Seogwipo Port (Boarding a Passenger Ferry) – Munseom (Board the Submarine) – Diver Show – Coral Garden – Getting off the Submarine – Tour in Munseom – Seogwipo Port|\n|Facility Utilization Fees:|Adults (ages 14 and older)&nbsp;55,000  won&nbsp;<br>Children (ages 3-13)&nbsp;&nbsp;36,000  won&nbsp; <br><br> *&nbsp;Please refer to the website for discount information|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-02-12-1676180133673/1618773_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-12-1676180133673/1618773_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-12-1676180133673/1618774_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-12-1676180133673/1618774_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-12-1676180133673/1618775_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-12-1676180133673/1618775_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-64-732-6060](tel:+82647326060)\n- [🏠www.submarine.co.kr](http://www.submarine.co.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.2392291431\nlongitude: 126.5587093030\ntitle: 40, Namseongjung-ro, Seogwipo-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>\nFrom Jeju International Airport, take the Airport Limousine Bus No. 600 and get off at Seogwipo Wharf Bus Stop.<br>Transfer to a bus bound for Seobugwangwang road and get off at Seogwipo Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2023-02-12-1676180133673","title":"Seogwipo Submarine (서귀포잠수함)","description":"When it opened in 1988, Seogwipo Submarine was the first of its kind in Asia and the third in the world.

There are many legends surrounding the rock. One legend has it that a dragon stealing precious jade from Hallasan Mountain was shot down by an arrow from the mountain deity. When he fell down, his body immediately sank into the ocean and his head rapidly froze looking at the sky. Another legend has it that a white horse, who dreamed of being a dragon and ascending to the sky, came to be caught by a soldier and froze into the rock.<br><br>From Yongduam Rock, visitors can see haenyeo (female divers) working at catching seafood. Near the rock are various cafes, bars, and restaurants. The coastal road between here and Aewol-eup is popular among couples.

Yeongsil Trail is known as the best autumn foliage course on Hallasan Mountain. Yeongsil Course is 3.7 kilometers and takes approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes. It starts from Yeongsil Rest Area and follows a relatively gentle slope lined with beautiful trees and autumn foliage for about one kilometer.<br> After that, an uphill path emerges along steep mountain ridges. The deep Yeongsilgyegok Valley and vast rock walls could be the result of a large volcano entrance in the past. After passing Byeongpungbawi Rock, the path becomes relatively flat until Witsaeoruem Rest Area. The first attraction of Yeongsil is a group of volcanic rocks collectively called Yeongsilgiam. These oddly shaped rocks are situated to the right of a big valley at 1,400 meters to 1,600 meters above sea level, soaring upwards towards the sky. Pass by Sajebi Hill to get a glass of mineral spring water, and  reach Eorimok to take the path downwards.","regDate":"2023-02-14","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites","National Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-14-1676364076313/2617909_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-14-1676364076313"},{"id":"2023-02-14-1676360164390","title":"Yeomiji Botanical Garden (여미지 식물원)","description":"Located within Jungmun Resort, Yeomiji Botanical Garden is one of the best botanical gardens in Asia with a unique southern atmosphere.

The island boasts fertile soil, abundant schools of fish, and scenic sights; local heritages (female divers, stone walls, and stone tombs) as well as natural attractions abound on the island, making it a miniature of Jeju Island. The island is also full of amenities and tourism outlets  fishing, bike trails, sand massages, submarine tours and cruises.
