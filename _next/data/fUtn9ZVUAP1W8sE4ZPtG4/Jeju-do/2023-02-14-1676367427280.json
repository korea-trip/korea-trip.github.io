There are many legends surrounding the rock. One legend has it that a dragon stealing precious jade from Hallasan Mountain was shot down by an arrow from the mountain deity. When he fell down, his body immediately sank into the ocean and his head rapidly froze looking at the sky. Another legend has it that a white horse, who dreamed of being a dragon and ascending to the sky, came to be caught by a soldier and froze into the rock.<br><br>From Yongduam Rock, visitors can see haenyeo (female divers) working at catching seafood. Near the rock are various cafes, bars, and restaurants. The coastal road between here and Aewol-eup is popular among couples. Cafes and seafood restaurants began to appear there five years ago and now form a pleasant café village.","regDate":"2023-02-14","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-14-1676371136721/2612544_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-14-1676371136721"},{"id":"2023-02-14-1676364076313","title":"Yeongsil Trail (Hallasan National Park) (한라산 영실)","description":"Hallasan Mountain has five trails excluding Donnaeko Course that is closed for nature preservation. Yeongsil Trail is known as the best autumn foliage course on Hallasan Mountain. Yeongsil Course is 3.7 kilometers and takes approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes. It starts from Yeongsil Rest Area and follows a relatively gentle slope lined with beautiful trees and autumn foliage for about one kilometer.<br> After that, an uphill path emerges along steep mountain ridges. The deep Yeongsilgyegok Valley and vast rock walls could be the result of a large volcano entrance in the past. After passing Byeongpungbawi Rock, the path becomes relatively flat until Witsaeoruem Rest Area. The first attraction of Yeongsil is a group of volcanic rocks collectively called Yeongsilgiam. These oddly shaped rocks are situated to the right of a big valley at 1,400 meters to 1,600 meters above sea level, soaring upwards towards the sky. Pass by Sajebi Hill to get a glass of mineral spring water, and  reach Eorimok to take the path downwards.","regDate":"2023-02-14","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites","National Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-14-1676364076313/2617909_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-14-1676364076313","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Jeju-do/2023-02-14-1676364076313"},{"id":"2023-02-14-1676360164390","title":"Yeomiji Botanical Garden (여미지 식물원)","description":"Located within Jungmun Resort, Yeomiji Botanical Garden is one of the best botanical gardens in Asia with a unique southern atmosphere.

The length of the island is 3.8 kilometers and the circumference is 17 kilometers. People have lived in Udo Island since the Joseon period, with most living as a farmer or working in the fishing industry. The island boasts fertile soil, abundant schools of fish, and scenic sights; local heritages (female divers, stone walls, and stone tombs) as well as natural attractions abound on the island, making it a miniature of Jeju Island. The island is also full of amenities and tourism outlets  fishing, bike trails, sand massages, submarine tours and cruises. At the highest point of the island, Udobong Peak (alt. 132 meters), visitors can see a panoramic view of the island as well as Seongsan Ilchulbong Tuff Cone and the main island. Rhodolith Beach (a white beach designated Natural Monument) has appeared regularly in films and TV commercials thanks to its breathtaking white sand and emerald sea. The sea around the beach showcases different colors depending on the water level. This makes Rhodolith Beach one of the most popular tourist attractions in Jeju-do, along with Hallasan Mountain. To protect the exquisite nature and promote maritime tourism, Bukjeju County designated two ports on the island (Udo Port and Haumokdong Port) and the sea surrounding it (25,863 ㎢) as Udo Maritime Park in January 2001. Visitors can appreciate maritime tourism at its best including a trip under the sea by submarine.","regDate":"2023-02-14","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-14-1676349661718/2654827_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-14-1676349661718","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Jeju-do/2023-02-14-1676349661718"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
