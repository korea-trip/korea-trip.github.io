Many hikers come up to the summit of the fortress despite its rough course to appreciate magnificent and mysterious scenery of strange rocks and bizarre stones at Seoraksan Mountain. When you are at the summit, you can see the landscape of not only the Outer Seorak but also the Inner Seorak. Below the Gwongeumseong Fortress are Allagam Hermitage built during the Silla period and Muhaksong (Korean red pine) existed for hundreds of years.
