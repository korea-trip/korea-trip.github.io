The communist Chinese army launched a major offensive attack for 10 days on October 6, 1952 during the Battle of Baengmagoji, which can be translated into the Battle of White Horse Highlands. Due to this battle, the communist Chinese army suffered around 14,000 casualties and the army completely collapsed while the 9th Infantry Division won the Battle of Baengmagoji and got the nickname “White Horse.” <br><br>After the battle, the area gave off a bad smell because of the dead bodies. The mountain area lost its original shape due to the severe battle and as a result the area was named “Baengmagoji” as it was said to resemble a white horse (baengma) lying down.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-33-450-5559|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Tour Course Information:|Baengma Station - Daema-ri Guard Post - The 2nd Tunnel - Peace Observatory - Woljeong-ri Station - Labor Party Office - Baengma Station|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Memorial Hall of Baengmagoji Battle, Monument for Baengmagoji Battle, Memorial Stone for Baengmagoji Battle, etc. |\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-10-05-1664956394526/2494536_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-05-1664956394526/2494536_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-05-1664956394526/2494537_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-05-1664956394526/2494537_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-05-1664956394526/2494538_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-05-1664956394526/2494538_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-05-1664956394526/2494539_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-05-1664956394526/2494539_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-05-1664956394526/2494540_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-05-1664956394526/2494540_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-05-1664956394526/2494541_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-05-1664956394526/2494541_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-05-1664956394526/2494542_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-05-1664956394526/2494542_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-05-1664956394526/2494545_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-05-1664956394526/2494545_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-33-450-5559](tel:+82334505559)\n- [🏠www.cwg.go.kr</a> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br><a href=\"http://hantan.cwg.go.kr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"new window popup\" class=\"web\">hantan.cwg.go.kr](http://www.cwg.go.kr/site/tour/main.do)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 38.2700172415\nlongitude: 127.1652863536\ntitle: 72, Daema 1-gil, Cheorwon-gun, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Train + Taxi]<br>\nBaengmagoji Station (Gyeongwon Line) <br>Take a taxi for approx, 4 min. to the venue.\n","data":{"id":"2022-10-05-1664956394526","title":"Memorial Tower of Baengmagoji Battlefield and Memorial Museum (백마고지 위령비와 기념관)","description":"Located in the northern area of South Korea, Baengmagoji Battlefield was one of the bloodiest battlefields during the Korean War.

The cable car boarding station is located in the Small Park of Seoraksan National Park. It takes about 10 min to get to the Gwongeumseong Fortress (700m above sea level) by the cable car. One-way ticket is not available, so visitors need to buy a round-trip ticket. Visitors can also enjoy an open view of various famous attractions such as Ulsan Peak and Manmulsang Rocks beyond glass window in the cable car. The Gwongeumseong Fortress, unfolding a panoramic view of Seoraksan Mountain’s majestic scenery, bears a legend in which two generals Gwon and Kim built the fortress in one day to prevent enemy invasion during the Goryeo period. Today, the site of the fortress only remains. Many hikers come up to the summit of the fortress despite its rough course to appreciate magnificent and mysterious scenery of strange rocks and bizarre stones at Seoraksan Mountain. When you are at the summit, you can see the landscape of not only the Outer Seorak but also the Inner Seorak. Below the Gwongeumseong Fortress are Allagam Hermitage built during the Silla period and Muhaksong (Korean red pine) existed for hundreds of years. As many tourists visit the mountain at weekends and during public holidays and autumn foliage season, it is recommended to schedule your trip by considering the waiting time too.","regDate":"2022-10-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-12-1665550201815/1950308_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-12-1665550201815"},{"id":"2022-10-11-1665485398263","title":"Seongyojang House (강릉 선교장)","description":"Seongyojang House is the former upper class residence of  Lee Nae-beon (1703-1781) and his family in Gangneung, Gangwon-do.
