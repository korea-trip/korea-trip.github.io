The mineral-rich spring  water offers a slew of natural health benefits. The alkaline water found in the natural hot spring contains a  variety of  minerals (about 20 types), including calcium and sodium bicarbonate. <br>\n <br>\n When you bathe in the hot spring, your skin absorbs these minerals, which speed up cellular restoration and blood circulation. An oxygenated circulatory system is beneficial in keeping not only your stomach, but your body's other vital organs and tissues healthy and strong. <br>\n <br> The hot spring offers natural treatment options for various common ailments such as arthritis, neuralgia, high blood pressure, stomach disorder, and stroke. Nestled in the mountains, the spa offers the relaxation of walking in the forest and breathing in the fresh valley air. Also, stopping by the historical statue at Asanho Lake along the west coast highway  to Asanoncheon Hot Spring will add an extra bit of fun to your weekend excursion.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-41-541-5526|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open year round)|\n|usetime:|Sunday-Friday 06:00-20:00<br>Saturday 06:00-21:00<br>(Last admission is one hour before closing)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-28-1658997789555/1599753_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1658997789555/1599753_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1658997789555/1599756_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1658997789555/1599756_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1658997789555/1599757_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1658997789555/1599757_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1658997789555/1599758_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1658997789555/1599758_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-41-541-5526](tel:+82415415526)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.8543644796\nlongitude: 126.9801018004\ntitle: 217-7, Asanoncheon-ro, Asan-si, Chungcheongnam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway + Bus]\n<br>- Onyangoncheon Station (Seoul Subway Line 1, Janghang Line)\n<br>Take city bus 100-1 and get off at Asanoncheon Hot Spring Bus  Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-28-1658997789555","title":"Asanoncheon Hot Spring (아산온천)","description":"Asanoncheon Hot Spring was discovered in 1987 and designated as a tourist zone in 1999.
