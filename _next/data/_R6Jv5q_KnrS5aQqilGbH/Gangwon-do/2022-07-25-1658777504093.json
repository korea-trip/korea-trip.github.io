There are many ranches in Pyeongchang, but Daegwallyeong Sheep Ranch is the only ranch that raises sheep. The sheep grazing field is surrounded by a 1.2 meter-long circular walkway, so visitors can view the sheep at all times during their visit. It takes about 40 minutes to walk along this path. A wooden shack located in the field appeared as a backdrop of the movie \"The Man from Mars.\"  The wooden shack fits perfectly with the sheep farm, and has become a popular photo site. To get a closer experience with the sheep, sign up for the feeding experience, where you can give hay to the sheep and even reach out to touch their fuzzy heads.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-33-335-1966|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|The day of Seollal (Lunar New Year's Day) & Chuseok (Korean Thanksgiving Day)<br>* May close in the case of adverse weather such as heavy snow, rain or thunderstorms; please call in advance.|\n|usetime:|November-February 09:00-17:00<br>March & October 09:00-17:30<br>April & September 09:00-18:00<br>May-August 09:00-18:30<br>* Last admission is 16:30.<br>* Hours are subject to change depending on weather or conditions on-site.|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Shopping Information:|Food & gifts available|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Admission Fees:|[Individuals]<br>Adults: 6,000 won / Children: 4,000 won / Senior citizens: 3,000 won<br><br>[Groups]<br>Adults: 5,000 won / Children: 3,500 won / Senior citizens: 3,000 won<br> <br>* Groups: 20 people or more<br>* Adults (ages 19-64), Children (ages 4-18), Senior citizens (ages 65 and older)<br>* Free admission: Preschoolers (ages 3 or under) / Free admission does not apply to groups of children<br>* Seniors citizens: ID required|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Sheep feeding area, royal azalea field, thached-roof house, marsh, walking trails, rest area, etc.|\n|Reservation Info. for Natives:|Reservations not accepted|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1583621_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1583621_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1583624_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1583624_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1583625_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1583625_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1583627_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1583627_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1890726_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1890726_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1890727_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1890727_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1890728_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1890728_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1890729_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1890729_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1890731_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1890731_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-33-335-1966](tel:+82333351966)\n- [üè†www.yangtte.co.kr]( http://www.yangtte.co.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.6876427505\nlongitude: 128.7533288363\ntitle: 483-32, Daegwallyeongmaru-gil, Pyeongchang-gun, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus + Taxi]<br>\nFrom Dong Seoul Bus Terminal, take an intercity bus to Hoenggye Intercity Bus Terminal.<br>From Hoenggye Bus Terminal, take a taxi to the ranch.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-25-1658777504093","title":"Daegwallyeong Sheep Ranch (ÎåÄÍ¥ÄÎ†π ÏñëÎñºÎ™©Ïû•)","description":"Daegwallyeong Sheep Ranch is a privately owned ranch on an area of 195 k„é°.

Driving from Chuncheon to the dam will take about one hour, but the Kwaeryongho Boat, a hovercraft that operates regularly on Soyangho Lake, only takes about 30 minutes. The hovercraft travels by ejecting air against the surface below, sending up a spray of water on either side of the boat to the delight of passengers. In the valley, visitors can see fish farms floating among the islets.
