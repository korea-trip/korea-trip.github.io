Driving from Chuncheon to the dam will take about one hour, but the Kwaeryongho Boat, a hovercraft that operates regularly on Soyangho Lake, only takes about 30 minutes. The hovercraft travels by ejecting air against the surface below, sending up a spray of water on either side of the boat to the delight of passengers. In the valley, visitors can see fish farms floating among the islets.
