The entrance of the school is marked with a large traditional \"Neowa\" (a house roofed with thick, unfinished shingles of pine) that immediately catches the eye.  \n<br><br>\nThe school provides three types of courses. There is a basic carpentry course to teach people how to make wooden objects and structures, a course to nurture professional carpenters, and a course to teach carpenters how to build Hanok. The school‚Äôs hands-on programs offer visitors a chance to make a traditional Korean window and to saw and plane wood. There are cultural programs for children as well. Children, along with their parents, can make rice cake by pounding rice with a large hammer, bake sweet potatoes, or join a seminar on traditional Korean houses. The cultural programs change with each season.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-54-373-8555|\n|parking:|Available (Free)|\n|restdate:|Saturday-Sunday|\n|usetime:|Inquiry hours 09:00-20:00 / Saturday 10:00-15:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Lecture rooms, tradtional tea house, accomodations, educational center, etc. |\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-29-1659116599234/1140727_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659116599234/1140727_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659116599234/1140736_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659116599234/1140736_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659116599234/1140740_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659116599234/1140740_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659116599234/1140742_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659116599234/1140742_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659116599234/1140752_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659116599234/1140752_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659116599234/1140755_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659116599234/1140755_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659116599234/1140764_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659116599234/1140764_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659116599234/1140779_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659116599234/1140779_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659116599234/1140781_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659116599234/1140781_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659116599234/1140786_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659116599234/1140786_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-54-373-8555](tel:+82543738555)\n- [üè†www.hanokschool.net](http://www.hanokschool.net/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.6404511493\nlongitude: 128.7279573928\ntitle: 156, Yangjeong-gil, Cheongdo-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-29-1659116599234","title":"Cheongdo Hanok School (Ï≤≠ÎèÑÌïúÏò•ÌïôÍµê)","description":"Located on the slopes of Namsan Mountain, the Cheongdo Hanok School is an educational center for carpenters who specialize in hanok (traditional Korean architecture). <br><br>Hanok buildings hold cultural and historical values and the school has been gaining in popularity not only among carpenters, but also those who are interested in enjoying and upholding Korea's proud architectural history.
