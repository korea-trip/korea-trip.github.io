The area‚Äôs big temperature difference between day and night and the frequent thick fog provide ideal conditions for tea cultivation. The tea cultivated at Gangjin Dawon has a strong scent and rarely tastes bitter. Gangjin Dawon is the home of the nation‚Äôs first green tea product ‚ÄúBaegunokpancha.‚Äù Since 1980, an extensive area of mountainous territory has been cultivated for green tea production to become the more than 80 acres of green tea fields that it is today. As Gangjin Dawon is relatively lesser known than the green tea fields in Boseong, visitors can enjoy a relaxing time surrounded by the vastness of the green tea fields. Nearby attractions include Baengnyeonsa Temple, the Birthplace of Yeongnang, Gangjin Goryeo Cheongja kiln site, and Dasan Chodang, the house where the famous scholar Dasan Jeong Yak-yong (1762-1836) lived during his exile.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-61-432-5500|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-19-1674110421678/2648774_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-19-1674110421678/2648774_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-19-1674110421678/2648775_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-19-1674110421678/2648775_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-19-1674110421678/2648776_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-19-1674110421678/2648776_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-19-1674110421678/2648777_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-19-1674110421678/2648777_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-19-1674110421678/2648778_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-19-1674110421678/2648778_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-61-432-5500](tel:+82614325500)\n- [üè†www.gangjin.go.kr](http://www.gangjin.go.kr/culture)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 34.7409031836\nlongitude: 126.7061613195\ntitle: 93-25, Baegun-ro, Gangjin-gun, Jeollanam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>\nFrom Seoul Central City Bus Terminal, take an intercity bus to Gangjin Bus Terminal. <br>\nFrom Gangjin Bus Terminal, take Bus No. 5-4 and get off at Weollam Bus Stop.<br>\nWalk for approx. 513 m.\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-19-1674110421678","title":"Gangjin Dawon Tea Plantation (Ï†ÑÎÇ® Í∞ïÏßÑÎã§Ïõê)","description":"Gangjin Dawon Tea Plantation is located at the southern foot of Wolchulsan Mountain in Jeollanam-do.

The bridge allows visitors to observe mud creatures all without stepping foot in the mud. The jjangttungeo (mudskipper) is only able to live in clean mud flats and they are easily found in this island. The name of the bridge comes from the image of many mudskippers jumping around the bridge. During low tide, the vast mud flat appears, as well as various mud organisms including mudskippers, crabs, clams and lug worms. When the tide is high, crossing this bridge will give the feeling of walking on water.

It is made up of 250 smaller islands, and it is famous for a strip of dry road that appears from the middle of the sea, near the end of February and mid June of the lunar calendar.  As it resembles a passage in the Old Testament in the Book of Exodus, the event is called ‚ÄúThe Miracle of Moses.‚Äù  When the water recedes, a road about 30-40 meter wide and 2.8-kilometer long appears and stays for about an hour before being submerged again. <br><br>Jindo Island has some legends which are still popular today, especially that of ‚ÄúOld Woman Bbyong of Hoedongri.‚Äù A long time ago, there were many tigers on Jindo Island. When tigers began appearing frequently in the village, the people fled to Modo Island. In the process, only the old woman Bbyong ended up remaining on the island, so the lady prayed everyday to Yongwang, the god of the ocean, to let her see her family again. Around February, Yongwang appeared to her in her dream and said, ‚ÄúI will send a rainbow to the sea tomorrow; ride it and cross the ocean‚Äù. The next day old woman Bbyong went out to the sea and prayed again, and the seawater parted as the rainbow road appeared.  Through this road, her family and the other villagers came back to the island. Therefore when the sea parts, the people celebrate this phenomenon by holding the Yeongdeung Festival to remember the Old Woman Bbyong. During the Festival, original folk plays of Jindo Island are performed and draws many tourists into Jindo Island.","regDate":"2023-01-24","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollanam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Eco-Tourism Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-24-1674535168286/1993038_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollanam-do/2023-01-24-1674535168286"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
