But in 1973, when the Empor Alpine Club reached the mountain during a hike across the nation, the club members named it after Jin Yu-myeong, a member of the expedition. On old maps, the mountain had been called Mayusan Mountain because of the horses raised in the area, but today it is more widely known as Yumyeongsan Mountain. The trail that starts from Yangpyeong leads to an expansive and open grassland. The hiking trails are also connected to those of Mount Daebusan and Mount Sogunisan. On the summit, there is a pile of stones, and the view from the top is splendid.","regDate":"2022-09-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-13-1663045696681/1358738_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-09-13-1663045696681"},{"id":"2022-09-12-1662979556312","title":"Yuldong Park (율동공원)","description":"Yuldong Park is a large urban neighborhood park located in the Bundang area of Seongnam.

The resort shares the area with various cultural relics such as Yongmunsa Temple; Yongmunsa Temple’s gingko tree; a stupa containing a relic of the Buddha, a monument of the reverend monk Jeongji; and the Yongmunsan Mountain area’s war record monument. The resort area is frequented by visitors throughout all four seasons but is especially popular in the fall because of the yellow-tinged gingko tree of Yongmunsa Temple (a Natural Monument).  <br><br>A 2 kilometers trek through the valley from Yongmunsa Temple will bring you to Yonggakbawi Rock, shaped like a dragon’s horn, halfway up the mountain. 1km away from Yonggakbawi Rock lays a huge boulder, Court Rock, on which 100 people can easily sit at the same time. There is also an amusement park that provides great entertainment for children, consisting of a rapid ride, a Viking-boat, a merry-go-round, bumper cars, a family coaster, and other rides. <br><br>Thirty minutes from Yongmunsa Temple is Jungwon Valley that looks small when seen from the outside, but leads to the mountain’s summit where you can enjoy a superb view. And only another fifteen minutes walk will bring you to the three-tiered Jungwon Falls where you can enjoy the sound of crashing waters and feel the cooling mists that rise from the base of the falls.","regDate":"2022-09-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Tourist Complexes"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098983_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-09-12-1662975964729"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
