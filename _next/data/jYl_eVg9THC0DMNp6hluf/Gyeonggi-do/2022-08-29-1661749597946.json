The name &lsquo;Jarasum&rsquo; comes from the fact that it faces a hill that resembles a Jara (Korean word for soft-shelled turtle). Jarasum consists of four islands called Dongdo, Seodo, Jungdo, and Namdo, and has various leisure and park facilities. Visitors can find a car camping site and the filming location of the popular TV drama series 'Iris' on Seodo (west island), and an eco-cultural park with a grass plaza of over 100 meters in diameter on Jungdo (central island). There is also an ecosystem theme park called Ehwawon Garden at the westernmost tip of the Jarasum Campground.
