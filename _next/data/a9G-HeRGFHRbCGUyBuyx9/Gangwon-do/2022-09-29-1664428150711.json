This private forest was planted and has been maintained by one man for over 30 years. He settled down in the area in 1985 with his wife who suffered from chronic indigestion. He started planting the ginkgo tree seedlings on his spacious field after he heard about the medicinal effects of the mineral waters from Sambong Springwater at the foot of Odaesan Mountain. The forest remained private until 2010, when its popularity spread by word of mouth. Since then, the owner has graciously agreed to open his private land up to the public for free during the month of October, when the whole forest takes on a golden hue.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-33-430-4505|\n|parking:|Not available|\n|usetime:|Open every October (10:00-17:00)|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-09-29-1664428150711/1850329_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-29-1664428150711/1850329_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-29-1664428150711/1850334_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-29-1664428150711/1850334_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-29-1664428150711/1852401_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-29-1664428150711/1852401_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-29-1664428150711/1852413_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-29-1664428150711/1852413_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-29-1664428150711/1852415_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-29-1664428150711/1852415_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-29-1664428150711/1852418_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-29-1664428150711/1852418_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-29-1664428150711/1852423_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-29-1664428150711/1852423_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-29-1664428150711/1852434_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-29-1664428150711/1852434_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-29-1664428150711/1852437_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-29-1664428150711/1852437_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-29-1664428150711/1850319_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-29-1664428150711/1850319_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-33-430-4505](tel:+82334304505)\n- [üè†www.hongcheon.go.kr](https://www.hongcheon.go.kr/tour/selectTourCntntsWebView.do?tourNo=2125&pageUnit=6&pageIndex=1&searchCnd=all&key=2038&ctgry=9&searchShowAt=Y)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.8321872306\nlongitude: 128.4707332608\ntitle: 686-4, Gwangwon-ri, Hongcheon-gun, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-09-29-1664428150711","title":"Hongcheon Ginkgo Forest (ÌôçÏ≤ú ÏùÄÌñâÎÇòÎ¨¥Ïà≤)","description":"Hongcheon Ginkgo Forest is only open to the public during the month of October.

Biryongpokpo Falls is located between Towangseong Falls in the upper region and Yukdam Falls in the lower region. Biryongpokpo Falls was named after the shape of the water stream of the falls (pokpo) resembling a dragon (ryong) ascending (bi) to heaven. Their powerful water streams pouring into the narrow and rough valley look like a legendary dragon. There is another tale associated with Biryongpokpo Falls. A dragon lived here, and one day villagers offered a maiden to the dragon to break the drought. Then, the dragon flew up to the sky, and there were no more droughts in the village. The waterfalls drop 16 m to the ground and their loud sound resonates in the valley. In winter, the waterfalls freeze and the frozen water columns offer another magnificent view. A clear pond is formed beneath the falls and around which there is a wooden observation deck. Biryongpokpo Falls and Surroundings in Seoraksan Mountain were designated as the Scenic Site No. 95. It takes about 1 hr from the Small Park to the Biryongpokpo Falls, while it takes about 3 hr (round-trip) to visit up to Towangseong Falls and Yukdam Falls.
