The large site is filled with traces of Baekje culture. Sabigung Palace is a reconstruction of a real royal palace from the Three Kingdoms period. Neungsa Temple, a royal temple representing the Baekje period, has been recreated according to the real size based on excavation research done at the historic site in Neungsan-ri, Buyeo-eup. Just inside Daetongmun Gate is the Five-story Stone Pagoda, the most prominent structure in the complex. Wiryeseong Fortress, built during the Hanseong Baekje Era, gives a different aspect of Baekje in comparison with Sabigung Palace from the Late Baekje Era. A panorama of the complex can be seen from Jehyangnu Pavilion.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|expagerange:|Open to visitors ages 7 and older|\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-41-408-7290|\n|restdate:|Mondays (open if Monday is a public holiday)|\n|usetime:|March-October 09:00-18:00<br>November-February 09:00-17:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Tour Course Information:|* Course  1 (Duration: 1 hr)<br> Baekje History & Culture Museum (3D viewing) ‚Üí Jeongyangmun Gate‚Üí Cheonjeongjeon Hall ‚Üí Neugsa Temple ‚Üí Living Culture Village ‚Üí Jeongyangmun Gate<br><br> * Course 2 (Duration: 2 hr)<br> Jeongyangmun Gate‚Üí Cheonjeongjeon Hall‚Üí Neungsa Temple ‚Üí Living Culture Village ‚Üí Wiryeseong Fortress  ‚Üí  Jeongyangmun Gate‚Üí Baekje History & Culture Museum<br><br>* Course 3 (Duration:  3 hr)<br> Jeongyangmun Gate ‚Üí Cheonjeongjeon Hall ‚Üí Neungsa Temple ‚Üí Gobun Park ‚Üí Jehyangnu Pavilion ‚Üí Living Culture Village ‚Üí Wiryeseong Fortress  ‚Üí Jeongyangmun Gate ‚Üí Baekje History & Culture Museum|\n|Film Locations:|Variety program \"Running Man\"|\n|Admission Fees:|[Baekje Cultural Land & Baekje History & Culture Museum]<br>Individuals - Adults 6,000 won / Teenagers 4,500 won / Children 3,000 won<br>Groups - Adults 4,500 won / Teenagers 3,000 won / Children 1,500 won<br> <br>[Baekje History & Culture Museum]<br>Individuals - Adults 2,000 won / Teenagers 1,500 won / Children 1,000 won<br>Groups - Adults 1,500 won / Teenagers 1,200 won / Children 800 won<br> <br> * Groups: 20 or more people<br> * Adults (ages 19-64) / Teenagers (ages 13-18) / Children (ages 7-12) <br> * Free admission (ID required): Preschoolers (ages 6 & younger), senior citizens (ages 65 & older)|\n|Available Facilities:|Museum shop, restaurant, snack bar, rest area, facilities rental service (wheelchair, baby carriage, etc.), unmanned bike rental|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Available in English & Japanese<br>  Inquiries: +82-41-635-7740|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1099667_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1099667_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1099690_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1099690_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1099717_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1099717_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1099783_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1099783_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1099798_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1099798_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1601228_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1601228_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1601229_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1601229_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1601231_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1601231_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1601233_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1601233_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1601234_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1601234_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-41-408-7290](tel:+82414087290)\n- [üè†www.bhm.or.kr](http://www.bhm.or.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.3065816893\nlongitude: 126.9067759265\ntitle: 455, Baekjemun-ro, Buyeo-gun, Chungcheongnam-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-28-1659004863960","title":"Baekje Cultural Land (Î∞±Ï†úÎ¨∏ÌôîÎã®ÏßÄ)","description":"Baekje Cultural Land is the largest history-themed park in Korea, built to share the beautiful culture of the Baekje Kingdom with the world.
