The name Bukchon, which literally translates to \"northern village,\" came about as the neighborhood lies north of two significant Seoul landmarks, Cheonggyecheon Stream and Jongno. Today, many of these hanoks operate as cultural centers, guesthouses, restaurants and tea houses, providing visitors with an opportunity to experience, learn and immerse themselves in traditional Korean culture. As Bukchon Hanok Village is an actual neighborhood with people's homes, visitors are advised to be respectful at all times while looking around.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-2-2148-4161|\n|parking:|Not available|\n|restdate:|Sundays|\n|usetime:|Weekdays & Saturdays 10:00-17:00<br>* Applies to 100-m long road along Bukchon-ro 11-gil|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Tour Course Information:|[dobo.visitseoul.net](http://english.visitseoul.net/walking-tour/BukchonHanokVillage_/622)|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Available Facilities:|Cafe, workshops, museum, etc.|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Jaedong Primary School Tourist Information Center:<br> +82-2-2148-4160 (English, Japanese)<br><br>Jeongdok Library Tourist Information Center: <br>+82-2-2148-4161 (English, Japanese, Chinese)|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-21-1658376681775/2363673_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658376681775/2363673_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658376681775/2363674_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658376681775/2363674_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-2-2148-4161](tel:+82221484161)\n- [üè†hanok.seoul.go.kr](http://hanok.seoul.go.kr/front/index.do)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5791612548\nlongitude: 126.9864254967\ntitle: 37, Gyedong-gil, Jongno-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway]<br>\nAnguk Station (Seoul Subway Line 3), Exit 1 or 2.<br> Go straight for approx. 300m to arrive at Bukchon Hanok Village.<br><br>\n\n[Bus]<br>\nTake Maeul Bus Jongno 02 and get off at Bukchon Hanok Village Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-21-1658376681775","title":"Bukchon Hanok Village (Î∂ÅÏ¥åÌïúÏò•ÎßàÏùÑ)","description":"Surrounded by Gyeongbokgung Palace, Changdeokgung Palace and Jongmyo Shrine, Bukchon Hanok Village is home to hundreds of traditional houses, called <em>hanok</em>, that date back to the Joseon dynasty.
