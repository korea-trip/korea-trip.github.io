As a rock island, Haegeumgang River belongs to Hallyeo Marine National Park, which is assigned as an official green area in South Korea.  Its original name was Galgotdo, because it is shaped like the spreading roots of arrowroot.  These days it is known as Haegeumgang River, meaning  Geumgangsan Mountain in the sea.<br><br>The most stunning scenery of Haegeumgang River is the sunset and sunrise and can be best viewed on Ilwollbong Peak or Lion Rock.  There is Shipjagul Cave in the center of Haegeumgang River, which is 100m long from east to west and 180m long from south to north. It has been called Shipjagul (meaning ‚Äòcross‚Äô in Korean) Cave because it looks like a cross when viewed from the sky.  If you go on the tour, you will be fascinated by the x_height of the rock walls and the inside of the cave.  A long time ago, scholars expressed their yearning for the beauty of nature by writing and reading poems they wrote on sailboats with a bowl of makkoli (rice wine) in their hands.<br><br>When you take a ship around the island, you‚Äôll be fascinated once more because of the great works such as the Maitreya Rock, which reflects on Eunjin Maitreya, Candlestick Rock and the 1,300 year old guardian pine tree of Haegeumgang River.<br><br>\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-55-639-4792|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-16-1671168960118/1784640_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-16-1671168960118/1784640_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-16-1671168960118/1999740_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-16-1671168960118/1999740_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-16-1671168960118/2612887_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-16-1671168960118/2612887_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-16-1671168960118/2612888_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-16-1671168960118/2612888_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-16-1671168960118/2612890_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-16-1671168960118/2612890_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-16-1671168960118/2612891_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-16-1671168960118/2612891_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-55-639-4792](tel:+82556394792)\n- [üè†tour.geoje.go.kr](http://tour.geoje.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 34.7371404431\nlongitude: 128.6761974382\ntitle: San 1, Galgot-ri, Nambu-myeon, Geoje-si, Gyeongsangnam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \nFrom Seoul Nambu Bus Terminal, take an intercity bus to Tongyeong.<br><br>From Tongyeong Intercity bus Terminal, take a bus to Haegeumgang.\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-16-1671168960118","title":"Geoje Haegeumgang Island (Í±∞Ï†úÎèÑ Ìï¥Í∏àÍ∞ï)","description":"As one of the best sights in Geojedo Island, Geoje Haegeumgang River is called the Geumgang River (Sea Diamond) of the South Sea.

The Daeseong-dong Tumuli are located in the center of the shell mounds of Hoehyeon-ri, the location of the founding of the Gaya Kingdom according to local legend.<br><br>The tumuli relics were excavated by researchers from the Kyungsung University Museum from 1990 to 1992 and were found to be the common burial ground of the dominant class of the Gaya Kingdom. On the hilltops, which were viewed as prime burial places, are the tombs of kings and rulers; on the slopes are the tombs of the lower classes. <br><br>A total of 136 tumuli were found in the Daesong-dong area. Further investigation of the tumuli revealed several important and interesting facts. First, from the end of the third century, men and horses were buried alive along with the dead. Also, weapons were bent and buried as well, with many of these artifacts being unearthed among the tumuli. Other materials found in the tumuli such as cylindrical bronze items, pinwheel-shaped bronze items, and jasper items showed that Gaya was involved in trade with Japan. The Daeseong-dong Tumuli is significant in that it gives a glimpse into the political and social structure of the Gaya Kingdom, and the cultural exchange between Korea, China, and Japan.","regDate":"2022-12-27","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-27-1672119336198"},{"id":"2022-12-27-1672115914882","title":"Yeonhwasan Provincial Park (Ïó∞ÌôîÏÇ∞ÎèÑÎ¶ΩÍ≥µÏõê)","description":"Yeonhwasan Mountain, located in Goseong, Gyeongsangnam-do, is just 524 meters tall, encompasses the three peaks of Ongnyeobong, Seondobong and Mangseonbong, and is widely recognized as an important provincial park.
