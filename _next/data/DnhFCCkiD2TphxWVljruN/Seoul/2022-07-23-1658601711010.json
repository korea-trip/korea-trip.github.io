Red pine trees salvaged from the demolition of Gyeongungung Palace were used to construct the house. It was originally located in Jegi-dong, Dongdaemun-gu, but was later restored and moved to its present location. The shrine of the house that was destroyed in 1960 was also restored. <br>\nBecause the house is more of a shrine rather than residential living quarters, it has many unique features. For example, unlike other houses, it has the <em>anchae</em> (women’s quarters) located across from <em>sarangbang</em> (men’s quarters) with <em>daecheong</em> (living room) positioned between them.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-2-3396-5882|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-23-1658601711010/1569164_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658601711010/1569164_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658601711010/1569165_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658601711010/1569165_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658601711010/1569167_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658601711010/1569167_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658601711010/2531125_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658601711010/2531125_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658601711010/2531126_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658601711010/2531126_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658601711010/2531128_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658601711010/2531128_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658601711010/2531129_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658601711010/2531129_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658601711010/2531130_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658601711010/2531130_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658601711010/2531131_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658601711010/2531131_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658601711010/2531132_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658601711010/2531132_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-2-3396-5882](tel:+82233965882)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5583638148\nlongitude: 126.9944031366\ntitle: 28, Toegye-ro 34-gil, Jung-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway]<BR>\nChungmuro Station (Seoul Subway Line 3, 4), Exit 3 or 4.<br>\nWalk for approx. 85 m to Namsangol Hanok Village.<br>\nHaepungbuwongun Yun Taekyeong's Jaesil is located inside Namsangol Hanok Village.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-23-1658601711010","title":"Haepungbuwongun Yun Taekyeong's Jaesil (해풍부원군윤택영댁재실)","description":"Haepungbuwongun Yun Taekyeong's Jaesil is a shrine house built by the father-in-law of King Sunjong of Joseon dynasty in 1906 when his daughter was proclaimed the crowned princess of Joseon and entered Changdeokgung Palace to later become Queen Sunjeong.

The name later changed again to the current Gyeonghuigung Palace in 1760. The palace grounds included many halls but they were mostly all burned down in a fire in 1829. After the Japanese occupation began, all remaining buildings on the site were torn down and the palace grounds were turned into Gyeongseong Middle School (now Seoul High School). The school moved to Gangnam area in 1987, afterwhich the previous location was turned into a park.
