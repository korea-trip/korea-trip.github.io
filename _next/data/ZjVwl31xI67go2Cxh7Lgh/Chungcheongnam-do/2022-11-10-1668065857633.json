It is known that the mountain was named Palbong (“eight peaks” in Korean) because of its eight peaks standing in a row. There are actually nine peaks, but the smallest was not included. Legend says the smallest weeps over its exclusion at the end of every December. The third peak is the highest, standing at 362 meters with a beautiful view and crisp air, making it ideal for hiking (3-hour course) and resting at the top. There is another mountain of the same name in Hongcheon, so this mountain is usually referred to as “Seosan Palbongsan.”","regDate":"2022-11-14","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongnam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-14-1668404666423/1919432_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Chungcheongnam-do/2022-11-14-1668404666423"},{"id":"2022-11-14-1668401983817","title":"Seosan Munsusa Temple (문수사(서산))","description":"The exact founding date of Munsusa Temple is unknown because there are no official records that have been discovered. The temple is estimated to date back to the Goryeo dynasty due to a prayer found in 1973 at the Gilt-bronze Seated Buddha in the temple’s Geungnaksiljeon Hall dated 1346. Around 600 items were discovered along with the prayer, including unbleached ramie cloth, a short-sleeved gown, rice, and barley. Munsunsa has the tranquil atmosphere of a mountain temple. When spring arrives, cherry blossom flowers and wild flowers bloom across the mountain and the nearby cattle farm call to mind a traditional Korean painting.<br><br>Munsusa Temples Geungnaksiljeon Hall is a beautiful building constructed in the Jusimpo style (the column brackets placed only on top of the columns) combined with Dapo style (the column brackets placed between columns as well as on top of the columns). It is designated as Chungcheongnam-do Tangible Cultural Property No. 13. Inside the gorgeously and majestically carved hall are many relics including Gilt-bronze Seated Buddha, Samsebulsang statues (statues of Buddhas of Three Times (past, present and future)), Nahansang statues (statues of disciples of Buddha), and various portraits of Buddha.<br><br> The Gilt-bronze Seated Buddha (x_height  70cm, length between knees  50cm) was created in 1346. It is a fine example of late Goryo dynasty style Buddha statue along with Gilt-bronze Seated Bhaisajyaguru Buddha of Janggoksa Temple (Treasure No.337).","regDate":"2022-11-14","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-14-1668401983817/1954556_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Chungcheongnam-do/2022-11-14-1668401983817"},{"id":"2022-11-14-1668399000382","title":"Seosan Illaksa Temple (일락사 (서산))","description":"Illaksa Temple is located on the southwestern side of Illaksan Mountain.

The trails are as easy and suitable for all hikers including the elderly and young hikers. A distant view of the west sea is even visible from the top of the mountain.
