In the Joseon dynasty, the intersection served as a major division point, with travelers of different classes, from wealthy officials to humble scholars, stopping by to take a break on their way. Many legends and enjoyable folk songs, known as <em>heungtaryeong</em>, originated from this area.

Legend says the smallest weeps over its exclusion at the end of every December. The third peak is the highest, standing at 362 meters with a beautiful view and crisp air, making it ideal for hiking (3-hour course) and resting at the top.
