It is known that the mountain was named Palbong (“eight peaks” in Korean) because of its eight peaks standing in a row. There are actually nine peaks, but the smallest was not included. Legend says the smallest weeps over its exclusion at the end of every December. The third peak is the highest, standing at 362 meters with a beautiful view and crisp air, making it ideal for hiking (3-hour course) and resting at the top. There is another mountain of the same name in Hongcheon, so this mountain is usually referred to as “Seosan Palbongsan.”","regDate":"2022-11-14","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongnam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-14-1668404666423/1919432_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Chungcheongnam-do/2022-11-14-1668404666423"},{"id":"2022-11-14-1668401983817","title":"Seosan Munsusa Temple (문수사(서산))","description":"The exact founding date of Munsusa Temple is unknown because there are no official records that have been discovered.

Around 600 items were discovered along with the prayer, including unbleached ramie cloth, a short-sleeved gown, rice, and barley. Munsunsa has the tranquil atmosphere of a mountain temple.
