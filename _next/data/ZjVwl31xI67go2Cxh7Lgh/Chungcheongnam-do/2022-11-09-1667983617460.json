Halmaebawi Rock is said to have once been a real woman, Mido, who lived during the Silla period. Her husband was sent on business and never returned. Mido sat by the ocean every day waiting for his return, eventually turning into a stone. Further out to sea, there is a large rock, which naturally earned the nickname of Halbaebawi. Many visitors come to Kkotji Beach all year round to enjoy the beautiful view, and take walks along the beach. The sunset scenery has also become a favorite for photographers.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-41-670-2691|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Changing room, shower booth, drinking fountain, camping site, tube & parasol rental|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-09-1667983617460/2426564_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-09-1667983617460/2426564_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-09-1667983617460/2649002_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-09-1667983617460/2649002_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-09-1667983617460/2649003_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-09-1667983617460/2649003_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-09-1667983617460/2649005_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-09-1667983617460/2649005_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-09-1667983617460/2716313_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-09-1667983617460/2716313_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-09-1667983617460/2716315_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-09-1667983617460/2716315_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-09-1667983617460/2716318_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-09-1667983617460/2716318_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-09-1667983617460/2426560_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-09-1667983617460/2426560_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-09-1667983617460/2649001_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-09-1667983617460/2649001_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-09-1667983617460/2649004_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-09-1667983617460/2649004_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-41-670-2691](tel:+82416702691)\n- [üè†www.taean.go.kr/tour](http://www.taean.go.kr/tour.do)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.5013661578\nlongitude: 126.3346639477\ntitle: Seungeon-ri, Taean-gun, Chungcheongnam-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-09-1667983617460","title":"Kkotji Beach (ÍΩÉÏßÄÌï¥ÏàòÏöïÏû•)","description":"Kkotji Beach, located in beautiful Anmyeon, features a 5 kilometer stretch of white sand, and attractions like Halbaebawi and Halmaebawi Rocks (Grandpa & Grandma Rocks).
