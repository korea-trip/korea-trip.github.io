The insides of the a tomb feature a square or rectangular-shaped burial chamber with earthen ground and stone walls, and a passage leading from the tomb entrance to the chamber. However, details of the burial chambers vary by tomb. Most of the tombs had been robbed before the investigation, but a few relics such as plates and pots have been excavated. At the time of excavation, the relics were presumed to have come from the Baekje dynasty (18 BC-660 AD), but it is now estimated that they date back to the Unified Silla Period (676-935 AD).","regDate":"2022-08-08","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-08-1659980555730/741946_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-08-08-1659980555730"},{"id":"2022-08-08-1659977795734","title":"Seoul Animation Center (서울 애니메이션센터)","description":"The Seoul Animation Center was established by the Seoul Metropolitan Government in May 1999 with the aim of providing comprehensive support to Korea’s cartoon and animation industry.
