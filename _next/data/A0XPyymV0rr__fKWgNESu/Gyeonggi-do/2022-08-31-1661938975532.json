But in 1973, when the Empor Alpine Club reached the mountain during a hike across the nation, the club members named it after Jin Yu-myeong, a member of the expedition. On old maps, the mountain had been called Mayusan Mountain because of the horses raised in the area, but today it is more widely known as Yumyeongsan Mountain. The trail that starts from Yangpyeong leads to an expansive and open grassland. The hiking trails are also connected to those of Mount Daebusan and Mount Sogunisan. On the summit, there is a pile of stones, and the view from the top is splendid.","regDate":"2022-09-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-13-1663045696681/1358738_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-09-13-1663045696681"},{"id":"2022-09-12-1662979556312","title":"Yuldong Park (Ïú®ÎèôÍ≥µÏõê)","description":"Yuldong Park is a large urban neighborhood park located in the Bundang area of Seongnam.
