Majestic peaks surround Mangyeongdae, the main peak, and forests of broad-leaved trees turn striking colors in the fall. \n<br><br>\nThe trails are beautiful with purple magnolias in mid-April and azaleas and mountain magnolias in May. The Unaksan Mountain Autumn Leaves Festival is held in mid-October every year as the leaves begin to turn.

But in 1973, when the Empor Alpine Club reached the mountain during a hike across the nation, the club members named it after Jin Yu-myeong, a member of the expedition. On old maps, the mountain had been called Mayusan Mountain because of the horses raised in the area, but today it is more widely known as Yumyeongsan Mountain. The trail that starts from Yangpyeong leads to an expansive and open grassland. The hiking trails are also connected to those of Mount Daebusan and Mount Sogunisan.
