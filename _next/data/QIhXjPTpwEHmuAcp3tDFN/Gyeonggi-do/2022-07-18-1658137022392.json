She would grow up to be the wife of the dynasty‚Äôs 26th ruler, King Gojong. The birthplace and the adjoining Memorial Hall are open to the public. \n<br>\n\nEmpress Myeongseong was a brilliant diplomat who pursued openness and reform to maintain the sovereignty of the nation. Unfortunately, her tumultuous life came to an end in the early morning hours of October 8, 1895 when she was murdered by the Japanese army. \n<br>\n\n<br>\nDuring Japanese colonial rule, the empress was wrongfully accused of being a jealous and overly ambitious person. Studies of various archives have since revealed what a great person she really was. Recently, numerous television productions and musicals have also corrected those misunderstandings. Renovated in 1995, her birthplace includes three buildings with servants‚Äô quarters, master‚Äôs quarters, and a separate house. A commemorative monument now stands at the site of the room where the empress studied as a child. The Memorial Hall in front of the house contains various archives and artifacts related to Empress Myeongseong‚Äôs life. There is also a 161-seat theater.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-31-887-3572|\n|parking:|Available (88 parking spaces)|\n|restdate:|Mondays, New Year's Day|\n|usetime:|March-October 09:00-18:00<br>November-February 09:00-17:00<br>* Last admission is 30 minute before closing.|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Parking Fees:|Large vehicles (16 person or more): 2,000 won <BR>Small vehicles: 1,000 won<br>Compact vehicles: 500 won|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-18-1658137022392/1589908_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-18-1658137022392/1589908_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-18-1658137022392/1589909_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-18-1658137022392/1589909_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-18-1658137022392/1589910_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-18-1658137022392/1589910_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-18-1658137022392/1589911_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-18-1658137022392/1589911_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-18-1658137022392/1589912_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-18-1658137022392/1589912_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-18-1658137022392/1589913_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-18-1658137022392/1589913_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-18-1658137022392/1589914_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-18-1658137022392/1589914_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-18-1658137022392/1589915_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-18-1658137022392/1589915_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-18-1658137022392/184960_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-18-1658137022392/184960_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-18-1658137022392/184964_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-18-1658137022392/184964_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-31-887-3572](tel:+82318873572)\n- [üè†www.yjcf.or.kr](http://www.yjcf.or.kr/main/empressmyungseong)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.2604936594\nlongitude: 127.6556516417\ntitle: 71, Myeongseong-ro, Yeoju-si, Gyeonggi-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>\nFrom Dong Seoul Bus Terminal, take a bus to Yeoju Bus Terminal.<br> \nFrom Yeoju Bus Terminal, take a bus bound  for Janghowon and get off at Jeombong Elementary School Bus Stop. <BR>Walk for approx. 5 min.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-18-1658137022392","title":"Birthplace of Empress Myeongseong (Queen Min) (Î™ÖÏÑ±Ìô©ÌõÑ ÏÉùÍ∞Ä)","description":"This is the house where Empress Myeongseong (Joseon Period) was born and lived until she was eight years old.
