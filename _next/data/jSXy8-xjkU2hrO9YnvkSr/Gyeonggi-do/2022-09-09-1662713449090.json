This was the first joint royal tomb of the Joseon dynasty.<br><br> King Sejong was the third son of the third ruler, King Taejong, and his wife Queen Wongyeong. He came to the throne at the age of 22. During his 32-year reign, he was very influential in the development of Korean culture. For example, King Sejong created the Korean alphabet, which he called Hunminjeongeum, and set up the Hall of Worthies (Jiphyeonjeon), an association of the kingdom’s brightest scholars. He also used Confucian principles to administer state affairs. Under the reign of King Sejong, therefore, many sectors including politics, economy, society and culture flourished. In fact, King Sejong the Great is regarded as making some of the most brilliant achievements in Korean history. <br><br> Yeongneung is currently located in Neungseo-myeon in Yeoju-si in Gyeonggi-do, but the tomb was originally located in Seogang, Gwangju. When it was constructed following Queen Soheon’s death in 1446, it was decided it should be a joint tomb, and the space on the right side was reserved for King Sejong. In 1450 when King Sejong died, he was buried together with the dead queen. Later, the tomb was moved to its current place, as it was thought that the original location was not an auspicious place according to geomantic traditions.<br><br> Various items that were originally buried in the tomb were excavated in 1973 and now are exhibited in the King Sejong the Great Memorial Hall, which is located in Cheongnyangni, Seoul. <br><br> Nyeongneung is the royal tomb of the 17th ruler of the Joseon dynasty, King Hyojong (1619-1659, reign 1649-1659), and of his wife Queen Inseon (1618-1674).<br><br> The tomb was originally located to the west of Geonwolleung (the tomb of King Taejo, the first ruler of the Joseon dynasty), but in 1673 cracks appeared on the tomb’s “Byeongpungseok” (stone border), and it was moved to its current location, which is to the east of Yeongneung (the tomb of King Sejong).<br><br> King Hyojong was the second son of King Injo, Joseon dynasty’s 16th ruler, and Queen Illyeol. Upon ascending to the throne, he devised a plan to conquer the northern region of Asia, including the Qing dynasty (part of China). As part of the plan, he reformed the military system and strengthened the army and military enforcements. King Hyojong had spent time in northern China when he was taken hostage by the Manchus. During that time he became exposed to many different cultures and technological advancements. When a group of Dutch sailors were shipwrecked on the Korean shore, King Hyojong ordered them to build the Korean army’s first muskets. <br><br> King Hyojong also implemented “Daedongbeop,” a tax system under which people had to pay taxes with rice, and circulated “Sangpyeongtongbo,” the coinage of the Joseon dynasty.","regDate":"2022-09-20","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-20-1663660086765/2482766_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-09-20-1663660086765"},{"id":"2022-09-20-1663655587484","title":"Yeoju Silleuksa Temple (신륵사 (여주))","description":"Silleuksa Temple is located along the upper section of the Namhangang River as it flows from Bongmisan Mountain in Yeoju.

Because the inlet is located on the west coast where the difference in the water level between high and low tide is great, fishing boats avoid the area during the shifting tides.
