Although the pronunciation of the name was never changed, its meaning slightly changed from “High Cloud Temple” to “Solitary Cloud Temple” after Choi Chi-won, a renowned scholar in the late Silla Period, helped to build two pavilions (Gaunru and Uhwaru) and renamed it.

As a royal building, it shows the Confucian architectural style, different from other Buddhist buildings within the temple.","regDate":"2022-12-08","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-08-1670470704932/721738_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-08-1670470704932"},{"id":"2022-12-07-1670409526753","title":"Turtle Rock & Natural Wild Juniper Habitat (거북바위 및 향나무 자생지 (울릉도, 독도 국가지질공원))","description":"Turtle Rock was given its name for its rock formation that resembles the shape of turtles climbing out to the rock.

Solidified lava flow as well as chilled margins can still be seen along the rocks slope. The western cliff of the rock is Tonggumi Village, where it serves as a home to wild juniper trees. On the northwestern side of the rock is Daepunggam Village, also a natural habitat for wild juniper trees. Both sites were designated as Natural Monuments for their significance. The juniper trees here are known to have a slower growth rate than those under normal condition due to rough winds.","regDate":"2022-12-07","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Eco-Tourism Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-07-1670409526753/1162809_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-07-1670409526753"},{"id":"2022-12-07-1670405766463","title":"Tonggumi Pebble Beach (통구미몽돌해변)","description":"At Tonggumi Pebble Beach on Ulleungdo Island, you can enjoy the views of impressive sea-side cliffs, the glittering ocean, and the dark pebbles that dot the landscape, all at once.

She also ordered the construction of the famous nine-story wooden pagoda of Hwangyongsa Temple, a significant achievement of Buddhist architecture. While many of her efforts laid the foundation for the unification of Three Kingdoms of Korea, Queen Seondeok’s reign was plagued by rebellion and strife and she died in 647 during a rebellion, 23 years before unification was realized.","regDate":"2022-12-07","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-07-1670398594153/179719_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-07-1670398594153"},{"id":"2022-12-07-1670395284321","title":"Tomb of King Wonseong (경주 원성왕릉)","description":"The tomb of the King Wonseong, 38th king of the Silla Kingdom (785-798) in Oedong-eup, Wolseong-gun, Gyeongju is Historic Site No. 26.
