The peak is so broad that 50 adults can sit on it at the same time. Among the rocks there is Seokcheon Pond, which never dries up. The peak used to be called ‚ÄúUnjangdae‚Äù because the summit is always covered with clouds and mist. Legend says that King Sejo of Joseon dynasty supposedly recited a poem on the summit. <br> <br> Munjangdae has a great view of Cheonhwangbong Peak, the highest peak of Songnisan Mountain. Visitors can also see Gwaneumbong, Chilseongbong, Sirubong, Tugubong, Munsubong, and Birobong peaks. In autumn, visitors can enjoy views of breathtaking fall foliage along the trail, which begins at Hwabuk-myeon, Sangju. There are also many cultural heritage sites including Janggakpokpo Falls, Seongbuksa Temple, Osongpokpo Falls and Gyeonhwonsanseong Fortress.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-43-542-5267,<br>+82-54-533-3389|\n|parking:|Available (Osong parking lot)|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restricted Mountain Areas :|[hiking.kworks.co.kr](http://hiking.kworks.co.kr/sub_map/map_user01.aspx)|\n|Areas Open to the Public:|Beopju Ticket office - Sesimjeong -  Sinseondae (6.1 km)<br> Osong area - Munjangdae (3.5 km) <br> Sesimjeong - Dohwa-ri (8.5 km) <br> Janggakdong - Cheonwangbong Peak - Munjangdae (6.5 km) <br> Sadam-ri - Nagyeongsan Mountain - Domyeongsan Mountain (6.5 km) <br> Haksodae - Cheomseongdae (6 km) <br> Sesimjeong - Munjangdae (3.3 km)<br> Cheonwangbong Peak - Hyeongjebong Peak (7.1 km)<br> Sogeumgang River - Gunjasan Mountain - Domagol Valley (6.5 km) <br> Tteokbawi Rock - Chilbosan Mountain - Ssanggokpokpo Falls (6.2 km) <br> Jeolmal - Ssanggokpokpo Falls - Jangseongbong Peak - Jesurijae (12 km) <br> Birosanjang Cottage - Sanggoam (1.2 km) <br> Seonnyubong Peak - Jebiso (1.8 km) <br> Hyeongjebong Peak - Mansu-ri (2.5 km) <br> Ungyo-ri - Gallon (2.8 km)|\n|Mountain Not Access Period:|- Walking Trails Closure<br>Spring: March 2 - April 30<br>Autumn: November 15 - December 15<br><br>* TBD by park directors based on fire weather advisories, snow/precipitation levels, and other local conditions.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Hwabuk Tourist Information Center, Hwabuk Park Office|\n|Parking Fees:|Small cars: 2,000 won<br>Mid-sized cars: 4,000~5,000 won<br>Buses: 6,000~7,500 won|\n|Admission Fees:|Beopjusa Temple admission fee|\n  \n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-43-542-5267](tel:+82435425267)\n- [üè†songni.knps.or.kr](http://songni.knps.or.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.5939740089\nlongitude: 127.8569080064\ntitle: Hwabuk-myeon, Sangju-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \nFrom Dong \nSeoul Bus Terminal, take an intercity bus to Songnisan Mt.
