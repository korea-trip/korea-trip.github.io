Some villagers who make frequent visits to Germany operate their vacant house as a tourist guesthouse. Attractions nearby are the Windbreak Forest and the Mulmi Coastal Road,&nbsp;one of the most beautiful coastal drives in Korea.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-55-867-8897|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Accommodations, restaurant|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-16-1671187023927/2485649_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-16-1671187023927/2485649_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-16-1671187023927/2593772_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-16-1671187023927/2593772_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-16-1671187023927/2593774_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-16-1671187023927/2593774_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-16-1671187023927/2652081_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-16-1671187023927/2652081_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-16-1671187023927/2652083_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-16-1671187023927/2652083_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-16-1671187023927/2652084_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-16-1671187023927/2652084_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-16-1671187023927/2652085_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-16-1671187023927/2652085_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-16-1671187023927/2703887_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-16-1671187023927/2703887_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-16-1671187023927/2703888_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-16-1671187023927/2703888_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-16-1671187023927/1991517_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-16-1671187023927/1991517_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-55-867-8897](tel:+82558678897)\n- [üè†ÎÇ®Ìï¥ÎèÖÏùºÎßàÏùÑ.com](http://ÎÇ®Ìï¥ÎèÖÏùºÎßàÏùÑ.com)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 34.8008747595\nlongitude: 128.0384735213\ntitle: 92, Dogil-ro, Namhae-gun, Gyeongsangnam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Seoul Nambu Terminal or Dong Seoul Terminal, take an intercity bus to Namhae Intercity Bus Terminal.<br>\nTake a Local Bus to Namhae-Mijo at Namhae Bus Terminal Bus Stop and get off at Naedongcheon Bus Stop.<br>\nWalk along the road for 623 m toward the village.<br><br>\n\n[Taxi]<br>\nApprox. 25 min from Namhae Bus Terminal.\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-16-1671187023927","title":"German Village (ÎèÖÏùºÎßàÏùÑ)","description":"The German Village was built for Korean residents who returned from living in Germany.
