The valley offers beautiful surroundings and clear water developed over the years. Hobakso Pond, shape like a grain-grinding tool, is located at the base of a 10-meter-high waterfall. With a circumference of 30 meters, the pond is also called Sirye Hobakso Pond, Guyeongpokpo Falls, and Baengnyeonpokpo Falls. In the past, the pond was a spiritual place where people would pray for rain. Surrounded by white granite rocks, the area is a scenic place of natural beauty, free from pollution. Visitors can also look around nearby Baengnyeonsa Temple, Hyeongjeso Pond and Ocheonpyeong Rock.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|•1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-55-359-5361|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-19-1671442571578/2589461_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-19-1671442571578/2589461_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-19-1671442571578/2589462_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-19-1671442571578/2589462_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-19-1671442571578/2589463_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-19-1671442571578/2589463_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-19-1671442571578/2589464_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-19-1671442571578/2589464_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-19-1671442571578/2589465_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-19-1671442571578/2589465_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-19-1671442571578/2660873_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-19-1671442571578/2660873_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-19-1671442571578/2660874_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-19-1671442571578/2660874_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-19-1671442571578/2660875_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-19-1671442571578/2660875_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-55-359-5361](tel:+82553595361)\n- [🏠tour.miryang.go.kr](http://tour.miryang.go.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.5946362486\nlongitude: 128.9943714290\ntitle: 334-1, Eoreumgol-ro, Miryang-si, Gyeongsangnam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>From Seoul Express Bus Terminal, take a bus to Masan Bus Terminal. <BR>From Masan Bus Terminal, take a bus to Miryang Bus Terminal.<br>\nFrom Miryang Bus Terminal, take a bus headed for either Nammyeong or Eoreumgol.\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-19-1671442571578","title":"Hobaksogyegok Valley (호박소계곡)","description":"Hobaksogyegok Valley is located within Gajisan Mountain approximately 3 kilometers away from Eoreumgol Valley in Jaeyaksan Mountain, where the water originates.

It is divided into two main sets separately owned by the major broadcasting companies KBS and MBC. The section owned by KBS houses reproductions of Seoul landmarks such as Seoul Station, Chosun Governor-General Office, and the Bando Hotel, as they appeared from the 1930s to the 1960s. MBC’s set focuses mainly on reproductions of streets from Sogong-dong, Seoul from the 1970s and 80s.
