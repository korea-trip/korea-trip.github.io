The garden is over twice the size of Yeouido Park in Seoul, and consists of natural water and a lush bamboo forest, known as Simnidae Forest, along with canola and forage barley fields. Simnidae Forest was once in danger of demolition as part of the government's flood control plans but remains preserved thanks to community efforts. Preservation efforts led to turning the area into Taehwagang National Garden of today, which took place from 2004 to 2010.","regDate":"2022-08-20","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Ulsan","Nature","Natural Sites","Eco-Tourism Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-20-1660977784342/2653664_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Ulsan/2022-08-20-1660977784342"},{"id":"2022-08-20-1660973797364","title":"Sinbulsan Falls National Recreational Forest (국립 신불산폭포자연휴양림)","description":"Sinbulsan Falls National Recreational Forest, located at the foot of Sinbulsan Mountain, is noted for the Yeongnam Alps and the beautiful surrounding valleys.

The main fortress is located on a mountaintop 200 meters above sea level, a  second fortress is halfway down the mountain, and a  third fortress is located at the bottom of the mountain.

In 1598, the fortress was taken over by Korea with the assistance of General Magwi of the Ming dynasty. A year later, Changpyodang Shrine was built in honor of 53 Koreans who died during battles against the Japanese invading forces. However, the shrine was destroyed during the Japanese imperialism period and no trace of it remains.
