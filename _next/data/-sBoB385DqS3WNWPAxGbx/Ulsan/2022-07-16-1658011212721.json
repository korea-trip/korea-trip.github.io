These petroglyphs can be observed from the bedrock connected to the foothills of Yeongosan Mountain. The rocks of Bungudae Terrace have been noted to be a scenic site since the old times, serving as an inspirational sight for poets and writers. Petroglyphs were found on a total of 10 rocks along Daegokcheon Stream, engraved on a rock surface spanning 10 meters in x_width and 3 meters in x_height. The engravings depict a total of 200 etchings including figures of land animals (deer, tigers, wild boar, etc.), hunting scenes, sea animals (whales, seals, sea turtles), and boats and fishermen. The Bangudae petroglyphs are important reflections of the hunting rituals and religious arts of Korea’s prehistoric era and serve as an important clue into the lifestyle and customs of ancient Koreans.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|expagerange:|Open to visitors of all ages|\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-52-204-0322,<BR>+82-52-277-0101, +82-52-229-4797|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Open 24 hr|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-16-1658011212721/2675597_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-16-1658011212721/2675597_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-16-1658011212721/2675599_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-16-1658011212721/2675599_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-16-1658011212721/2675600_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-16-1658011212721/2675600_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-16-1658011212721/2675628_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-16-1658011212721/2675628_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-52-204-0322](tel:+82522040322)\n- [🏠tour.ulju.ulsan.kr](https://tour.ulju.ulsan.kr/PmtentursmView.mo?pageType=modify&type=ten&idx=81)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.6037219778\nlongitude: 129.1774107206\ntitle: 285, Bangudaean-gil, Ulju-gun, Ulsan\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-16-1658011212721","title":"Petroglyphs of Bangudae Terrace (울주 대곡리 반구대 암각화)","description":"Petroglyphs of Bangudae Terrace are located in Daegok-ri, Ulsan.
