Red pine trees salvaged from the demolition of Gyeongungung Palace were used to construct the house. It was originally located in Jegi-dong, Dongdaemun-gu, but was later restored and moved to its present location. The shrine of the house that was destroyed in 1960 was also restored. <br>Because the house is more of a shrine rather than residential living quarters, it has many unique features. For example, unlike other houses, it has the <em>anchae</em> (women’s quarters) located across from <em>sarangbang</em> (men’s quarters) with <em>daecheong</em> (living room) positioned between them.","regDate":"2022-07-23","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Old Houses"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-23-1658601711010/1569166_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-07-23-1658601711010"},{"id":"2022-07-23-1658597858400","title":"Gyeonghuigung Palace (경희궁)","description":"Gyeonghuigung Palace, Historic Site No. 271, was originally called the large palace by Saemun Gate, or the Western Palace, for its location within the city. It was not until the eighth year of Gwanghaegun (1616) that the palace was used as a royal residence for the king, changing the name to Gyeongdeokgung Palace. The name later changed again to the current Gyeonghuigung Palace in 1760. The palace grounds included many halls but they were mostly all burned down in a fire in 1829. After the Japanese occupation began, all remaining buildings on the site were torn down and the palace grounds were turned into Gyeongseong Middle School (now Seoul High School). The school moved to Gangnam area in 1987, afterwhich the previous location was turned into a park. The palace grounds currently hold Seoul Museum of Art and walking paths, as well as a restoration of Heunghwamun Gate, the main gate of the palace, and Sungjeongjeon Hall, the main hall, completed in November 1994.","regDate":"2022-07-23","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Palaces"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-23-1658597858400/1568231_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-07-23-1658597858400"}],"navList":["Busan","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
