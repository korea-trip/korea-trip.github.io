Cultural properties in the folk village have been handed down from generation to generation and include treasures such as residential houses, Confucian shrines and schools, ancient government offices, stone statues, large millstones (pulled by horses or ox), fortress ruins, and stone monuments. Among the cultural gems of the folk village are intangible cultural assets such as folk plays, native foods, local folk craftsmanship, and local dialect. Even the trees are an important part of the area’s heritage. Several zelkova and nettle trees that are hundreds of years old stand at the center of the village, preserving the dignified atmosphere of a bygone era. <br><br> The Seongeup Folk Village shows the unique culture of Jeju Island. The local tongsi (traditional Jeju restroom) are especially well-known characteristics of Jeju folk culture.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-64-710-6797|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Tour Course Information:|South Gate → Yeonjamae (ox-pulled millstone) & Gopyeongo’s old house → Gosangeun’s old house → Bangjuk → Jeongeuihyeon → zelkova tree & hackberry tree → lgwanheon (ancient administration building) → Leeyeongsuk’s old house → Jeongui Hyanggyo→ Hanbongil’s old house → South Gate|\n|Available Facilities:|Accomodation, restaurants etc.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-02-12-1676191105346/898566_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-12-1676191105346/898566_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-12-1676191105346/898575_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-12-1676191105346/898575_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-12-1676191105346/2364389_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-12-1676191105346/2364389_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-12-1676191105346/2364393_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-12-1676191105346/2364393_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-12-1676191105346/2455556_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-12-1676191105346/2455556_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-12-1676191105346/2455561_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-12-1676191105346/2455561_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-12-1676191105346/2455562_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-12-1676191105346/2455562_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-12-1676191105346/2455564_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-12-1676191105346/2455564_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-12-1676191105346/2455570_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-12-1676191105346/2455570_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-12-1676191105346/898556_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-12-1676191105346/898556_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-64-710-6797](tel:+82647106797)\n- [🏠www.visitjeju.net](http://www.visitjeju.net/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.3845391870\nlongitude: 126.8003906281\ntitle: 19, Seongeupjeonguihyeon-ro, Seogwipo-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Jeju Intercity Bus Terminal take an Intercity Bus to Beonnyeong-ro.<br>\nGet off at Seongeup 1(il)-ri Office Bus Stop. <br>\nGo around the corner and walk along the road for about 200m.\n","data":{"id":"2023-02-12-1676191105346","title":"Seongeup Folk Village (성읍민속마을)","description":"Located at the foot of Halla Mountain on Jeju Island, Seongeup Folk Village is a small town that holds a vast amount of culture over a wide period of time from 1410 to 1914.

It is thought to have been created by the lava that erupted from Hallasan Mountain some 25 million years ago. This cave uniquely contains features of both lava and limestone caves. The entire area surrounding the cave is a huge stratum of seashells and sand, while the interior of the cave has a mystical ambience due to its various formations such as stalactites and stalagmites, hanging from the ceiling and sprouting up from the bottom of the cave. The cave also features pillars formed when stalactites and stalagmites join together. The cave walls are covered in lime, which at times looks like beautiful cave paintings. The temperature inside the cave stays at 17~18℃ throughout the year, making the cave a welcome escape from the summer heat and a great place to keep warm during winter. <Br><Br>Hyeopjaegul Lava Tube has been designated Natural Monument No. 236 and ranks among the world’s major mysterious caves, such as the stone salt cave of Peru and the underwater limestone caves of Yugoslavia.
