The name changed from Bunjae Arpia in 2007 to commemorate the 15th anniversary after opening and to renew the garden as an international garden. The history of the garden started in 1963 when Seong Beom-yeong, the founder of the garden, came to Jeju and cultivated the wasteland full of rocks. The garden came into the international spotlight as the beautiful space was created from the wastelands by a single farmer. The garden has been visited by many honored public figures such as Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao from China, Nakasone from Japan, Kim Yongsun from North Korea and others. Currently, about 400 planted trees are on display. Also, visitors can see various facilities including stone walls and stone towers stacked with Jeju volcanic stones, the largest artificial waterfall in Jeju, and a pond filled with large carp at the base of the the waterfall.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-64-772-3701~3|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|[November-March] 08:30-18:00 <br>[April-October] 08:30-18:30<br>* Last ticketing 1 hr before closing|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Various gardens, historical photo exhibition, celebrity photo exhibition, museum shop, cafe, observation deck, pavilion, seminar room, cafeteria|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 12,000 won / Teenagers & senior citizens 10,000 won / Children 7,000 won <br>Groups - Adults 10,000 won / Teenagers & senior citizens 8,000 won / Children 5,000 won<br><br>* Adults (ages 19-64) / Teenagers (middle & high school students) / Children (ages 3-elementary students) / Senior citizens (ages 65 & over)<br>* Groups - 20 people or more|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-02-13-1676280988564/608547_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-13-1676280988564/608547_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-13-1676280988564/1206506_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-13-1676280988564/1206506_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-13-1676280988564/1206507_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-13-1676280988564/1206507_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-13-1676280988564/1206511_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-13-1676280988564/1206511_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-13-1676280988564/1206513_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-13-1676280988564/1206513_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-13-1676280988564/1206519_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-13-1676280988564/1206519_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-13-1676280988564/1206523_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-13-1676280988564/1206523_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-13-1676280988564/1206525_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-13-1676280988564/1206525_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-13-1676280988564/1206529_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-13-1676280988564/1206529_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-13-1676280988564/608545_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-13-1676280988564/608545_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-64-772-3701](tel:+82647723701)\n- [üè†www.spiritedgarden.com](http://www.spiritedgarden.com/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.3254009536\nlongitude: 126.2551753838\ntitle: 675, Nokchabunjae-ro, Jeju-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Taxi]<BR>\nApprox. 40 min from Jeju International Airport.\n","data":{"id":"2023-02-13-1676280988564","title":"Spirited Garden (ÏÉùÍ∞ÅÌïòÎäî Ï†ïÏõê)","description":"Spirited Garden is home to hundreds of bonsai plants in a natural garden with the theme of oreum (volcanic cone) and water.

It is thought to have been created by the lava that erupted from Hallasan Mountain some 25 million years ago. This cave uniquely contains features of both lava and limestone caves. The entire area surrounding the cave is a huge stratum of seashells and sand, while the interior of the cave has a mystical ambience due to its various formations such as stalactites and stalagmites, hanging from the ceiling and sprouting up from the bottom of the cave. The cave also features pillars formed when stalactites and stalagmites join together. The cave walls are covered in lime, which at times looks like beautiful cave paintings. The temperature inside the cave stays at 17~18‚ÑÉ throughout the year, making the cave a welcome escape from the summer heat and a great place to keep warm during winter. <Br><Br>Hyeopjaegul Lava Tube has been designated Natural Monument No. 236 and ranks among the world‚Äôs major mysterious caves, such as the stone salt cave of Peru and the underwater limestone caves of Yugoslavia.
