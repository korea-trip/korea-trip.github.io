It is a rapid means of traveling between downtown Sokcho and Abai Village along the 50 m-long waterway. This small barge-style boat without an engine can be run by pulling the wire manually. When fixing the solid steel wire on both sides of the waterway and pulling it hard with a hook, a boat moves forward slowly. As there is no boatman, passengers need to work together to move the boat. It takes about 5 min to cross the water by boat. This unique experience still attracts many tourists to Sokcho. Furthermore, it is known as the filming location for the Korean TV drama Autumn in My Heart, so many tourists from Japan and China visit the place.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|accomcount:|About 30 people|\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-33-635-2003|\n|parking:|Available (Capacity: about 50 small vehicles)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Film Locations:|\"Autumn in my Heart (2000)\"|\n|Facility Utilization Fees:|- Route: Cheongho-dong - Jungang-dong <br>- Operating hours: 04:30-23:00 <br>- Fare (one-way basis): Adults 500 won / Children 300 won / Handcart ¬∑ Bike 500 won|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-24-1658634922819/166463_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658634922819/166463_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658634922819/209268_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658634922819/209268_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658634922819/209764_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658634922819/209764_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658634922819/209773_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658634922819/209773_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658634922819/483577_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658634922819/483577_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658634922819/483580_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658634922819/483580_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658634922819/677177_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658634922819/677177_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658634922819/677179_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658634922819/677179_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658634922819/677180_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658634922819/677180_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658634922819/677181_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658634922819/677181_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-33-635-2003](tel:+82336352003)\n- [üè†www.abai.co.kr](http://www.abai.co.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 38.2028631815\nlongitude: 128.5922246895\ntitle: 39, Jungangbudu-gil, Sokcho-si, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\n From Dong Seoul Bus Terminal or Seoul Express Bus Terminal, take an express bus to Sokcho Intercity Bus Terminal or Sokcho Express Bus Terminal.<br>\n - Walk approx. 10-15 min to Sokcho Harbor.<br> - The ferry dock is at the end of the harbor.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-24-1658634922819","title":"Abai Village Ferry (ÏïÑÎ∞îÏù¥ÎßàÏùÑ Í∞ØÎ∞∞)","description":"Gaetbae (boat without engine) is an exotic means of transportation to cross the Abai Village at the mouth of Cheongchoho Lake.
