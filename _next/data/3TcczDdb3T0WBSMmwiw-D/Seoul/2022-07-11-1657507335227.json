The structure consists of a main room offering a good view of the whole village, spacious bedrooms, a large garden, and annex buildings. As it withholds the beauty of a traditional hanok while incorporating the modern trend of its time, Baek In-je House is considered to be highly valuable in means of both architecture and history, representing the Bukchon Hanok Village together with Yun Bo-seon House.<br /><br />Baek In-je House was built from black pine, which was first introduced in Seoul during the Gyeongseong Expo in 1907, distinguishing itself from other upper-class houses of its time. Unlike other traditional hanok designs that separate the main building from the other rooms, Baek In-je House connects the two with a hallway, allowing convenient access between the two structures. The house also consists of a Japanese-style hallway and floor mat rooms, reflecting the interior trends of that period. Baek In-je House is also unique in that the main room is partially built as a two-story structure, a style that was never seen in any traditional hanok built during the Joseon period.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|accomcount:|100 people|\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-2-724-0200|\n|restdate:|Mondays (open in the case of Monday is a public holiday), New Year's Day|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00 (Last admission 17:30)<br />* Outdoor facility accessible during free viewing time <br />* Indoor areas off limits|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Reservation & on-site registration available for guided tours<br> Schedule: 16:00 (Wednesdays - Japanese / Thursdays - Chinese / Fridays - English)<br><br> * Elementary students and younger children must be accompanied by an adult.<br>* Call +82-2-724-0232 for cancellations. <br>* Reservation canceled if more than 10 min late|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481870_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481870_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481871_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481871_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481872_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481872_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481874_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481874_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481877_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481877_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481878_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481878_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481879_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481879_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481880_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481880_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481890_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481890_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-2-724-0200](tel:+8227240200)\n- [üè†www.museum.seoul.kr](http://www.museum.seoul.kr/www/intro/annexIntro/annex_22/annex_22_01.jsp?sso=ok)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5804416194\nlongitude: 126.9840701194\ntitle: 16, Bukchon-ro 7-gil, Jongno-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-11-1657507335227","title":"Baek In-je House (Î∞±Ïù∏Ï†úÍ∞ÄÏò•)","description":"Baek In-je House in Gahoe-dong, located in Bukchon Hanok Village, is a hanok built during the Japanese administration period that portrays modern hanok features.

After visiting the site, Doseonguksa made a prophecy that led to the construction of the temple. According to legend, he used only his walking stick to carve the large Bodhisattva that sits at the temple. Interestingly enough, the statue does not show any evidence of chisel marks, further adding to the mystery of how the statue was made.  <br><br>During the 7th year of King Gwangmu of the Joseon dynasty, Doseonsa Temple was officially named the representative temple of Korea with the purpose of promoting Cheongdamdaejongsa's Korean Buddhism movement, aiming at a religious revival. Due to these special circumstances Deseonsa Temple gained a high reputation and much recognition, which have held strong to this day.<br><br>Inside the temple, visitors can view the remains and written works of Cheongdamdaejongsa in the Cheongdamdaejongsa Memorial Hall. Next to the road leading to Cheonbuljeon Hall is a pond where you can toss a coin and make a wish and just past Yongammun Gate is a hiking path connecting Baegundae Cliff and Insubong Peak. Inside the Ksitigarbha Hall are portraits of President Park Chung-hee, Yuk Yeong-su, and Hyundai Chairman Chung Ju-yung. In front of the hall is a tree that is said to have been planted by a Buddhist priest who brought it from India 200 years ago. Historical artifacts can be found throughout the temple.","regDate":"2022-07-22","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-22-1658511854030/632948_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-07-22-1658511854030"},{"id":"2022-07-22-1658509078639","title":"Dosan Park (ÎèÑÏÇ∞Í≥µÏõê)","description":"Located in Sinsa-dong, Seoul, Dosan Park, a neighborhood park, was built in 1973 to pay tribute to Dosan Ahn Chang-ho‚Äôs patriotism.

The traces of the past still remain on Dongnimmun with two pillars in front of Dongnimmun&nbsp;being the remains of Yeongeunmun. <br> <br> The Arc de Triomphe in France can be recalled in comparison to Dongnimmun.
