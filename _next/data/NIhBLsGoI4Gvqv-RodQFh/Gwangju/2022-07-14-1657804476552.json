The Jusangjeolli cliffs of Mudeungsan Mountain consist of Seoseokdae, Ipseokdae, and Gyubong Rocks formed about 70 million years ago. Ipseokdae and Gyubong Rocks are both of a distinct pillar shape as they have been heavily weathered, and Seoseokdae, which was less weathered, looks like a folding screen. The Neodeolgeong (cluster of rocks), which sit on the mountain slope, were made when stone pillars collapsed. The standing rocks and Neodolgeong have been designated as Natural Monuments due to their rarity and uniqueness.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-62-227-1187|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Available Facilities:|Cheongpum Rest Area|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|[For detail info](http://mudeungsan.gwangju.go.kr/contents.do?S=S21&M=010500000000)|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-14-1657804476552/1558929_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-14-1657804476552/1558929_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-14-1657804476552/1558930_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-14-1657804476552/1558930_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-14-1657804476552/1558932_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-14-1657804476552/1558932_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-14-1657804476552/1558935_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-14-1657804476552/1558935_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-14-1657804476552/1558936_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-14-1657804476552/1558936_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-14-1657804476552/1558940_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-14-1657804476552/1558940_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-14-1657804476552/1558941_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-14-1657804476552/1558941_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-14-1657804476552/1558945_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-14-1657804476552/1558945_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-14-1657804476552/1558949_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-14-1657804476552/1558949_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-14-1657804476552/1558950_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-14-1657804476552/1558950_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-62-227-1187](tel:+82622271187)\n- [üè†mudeung.knps.or.kr</a> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br /><a href=\"http://www.cha.go.kr/\" target=\"_blank\">www.cha.go.kr](http://mudeung.knps.or.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.1200598333\nlongitude: 126.9989650099\ntitle: San 354-1, Yongyeon-dong, Dong-gu, Gwangju\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>\nFrom Gwangju Bus Terminal (U-Square) Bus Stop, take Bus No. 09 and get off at the Entrance of Jeungsimsa Temple Bus Stop. <br>\nWalk towards Mudeungsan Provincial Park.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-14-1657804476552","title":"Jusangjeolli Cliff of Mudeungsan Mountain (Î¨¥Îì±ÏÇ∞ Ï£ºÏÉÅÏ†àÎ¶¨ÎåÄ)","description":"The Jueangjeolli cliffs are rock pillars of various hexagonal shapes that seem as if they were hand carved.
