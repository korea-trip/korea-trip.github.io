It is said that during the Silla Kingdom, a white lotus flower bloomed here, and thats why the temple is called Baengnyeonsa (lit. White Lotus Temple). The temple is the only remaining temple out of 14 that were built in the Gucheon-dong area of Muju. After walking over Baengnyeongyo Bridge at the entrance of the temple, you will come to a stone stairway. At the top is the main sanctuary. The majesty and beauty of the main sanctuary is well complemented by the mountains. The Mokjosamjonbul Stone Buddha within the main building is presumed to have been built in the latter half of the Joseon dynasty. Past Myeongbujeon is Baengnyeonsa‚Äôs Sajeokbi tombstone, and the workmanship of the carved calligraphy is very highly regarded.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-63-322-3395|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-06-1672994325436/710884_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-06-1672994325436/710884_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-06-1672994325436/710891_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-06-1672994325436/710891_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-06-1672994325436/710914_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-06-1672994325436/710914_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-06-1672994325436/1248159_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-06-1672994325436/1248159_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-06-1672994325436/1248167_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-06-1672994325436/1248167_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-06-1672994325436/1248173_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-06-1672994325436/1248173_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-06-1672994325436/1248222_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-06-1672994325436/1248222_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-06-1672994325436/1248236_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-06-1672994325436/1248236_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-06-1672994325436/1248242_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-06-1672994325436/1248242_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-06-1672994325436/710911_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-06-1672994325436/710911_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-63-322-3395](tel:+82633223395)\n- [üè†baekryeon.eduniety.net](http://baekryeon.eduniety.net/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.8606393491\nlongitude: 127.7665945072\ntitle: 580, Baengnyeonsa-gil, Muju-gun, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-06-1672994325436","title":"Muju Baengnyeonsa Temple (Î∞±Î†®ÏÇ¨(Î¨¥Ï£º))","description":"Baengnyeonsa Temple is located in the upper part of Gucheondong Valley on Deogyusan Mountain.

The tunnel is approximately 3 meters in x_height and 10 meters in length, and divides the villages of Sindu Maeul into Dugil-ri, Seolcheon-myeon and Inam Maeul in Socheon-ri. During the Three Kingdoms Period, the rocky ridges of Seokgyeonsan Mountain drew the boundary of Sillas Mupung in the east with Baekjes Seolcheo to the west. <br>Tracing the history from the Three Kingdoms Period to the Goryeo dynasty, the cultures and traditions of the two regions were markedly different. If curious about the difference, one could simply stop by Seolcheon on market day, where the Muju and Mupung local dialects and customs can easily be distinguished. <br><br>People used to cross Seokgyeonsan Mountain by a footpath along the rocky ridge to travel between Seolcheon and Mupung. During the Japanese occupation, a new road was created by turning a cave into a tunnel through the mountain so cows and horse carts could freely pass from Muju to Gimcheon. <br><br>General Kim Yoo Shin from the Silla Kingdom, the hero of unification of the Three Kingdoms, often passed by the gate, later giving rise to the gates nickname, Tongilmun (literally Unification Gate). The gate is number one on the list of 33 scenic sites in Gucheon-dong.","regDate":"2023-01-08","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Nature","Natural Resources","Rocks"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-08-1673167020129/2366378_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-08-1673167020129"},{"id":"2023-01-08-1673163317005","title":"Omokdae and Imokdae Historic Sites (Ïò§Î™©ÎåÄÏôÄ Ïù¥Î™©ÎåÄ)","description":"Omokdae Historic Site is located on top of a steep hill and is one of the places where Yi Seong-gye, who later became King Taejo, the first king of the Joseon dynasty, stopped to celebrate his victory on his way home from a war against the Japanese army at Unbong Peak of Hwangsan Mountain.

Approximately 80 meters downhill from Imokdae are memorial stones and a building where Mokjo, the great-great-grandfather of King Taejo, once used to live.
