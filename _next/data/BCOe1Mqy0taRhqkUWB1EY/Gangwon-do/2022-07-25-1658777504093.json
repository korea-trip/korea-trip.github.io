There are many ranches in Pyeongchang, but Daegwallyeong Sheep Ranch is the only ranch that raises sheep. The sheep grazing field is surrounded by a 1.2 meter-long circular walkway, so visitors can view the sheep at all times during their visit. It takes about 40 minutes to walk along this path. A wooden shack located in the field appeared as a backdrop of the movie \"The Man from Mars.\"  The wooden shack fits perfectly with the sheep farm, and has become a popular photo site. To get a closer experience with the sheep, sign up for the feeding experience, where you can give hay to the sheep and even reach out to touch their fuzzy heads.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-33-335-1966|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|The day of Seollal (Lunar New Year's Day) & Chuseok (Korean Thanksgiving Day)<br>* May close in the case of adverse weather such as heavy snow, rain or thunderstorms; please call in advance.|\n|usetime:|November-February 09:00-17:00<br>March & October 09:00-17:30<br>April & September 09:00-18:00<br>May-August 09:00-18:30<br>* Last admission is 16:30.<br>* Hours are subject to change depending on weather or conditions on-site.|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Shopping Information:|Food & gifts available|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Admission Fees:|[Individuals]<br>Adults: 6,000 won / Children: 4,000 won / Senior citizens: 3,000 won<br><br>[Groups]<br>Adults: 5,000 won / Children: 3,500 won / Senior citizens: 3,000 won<br> <br>* Groups: 20 people or more<br>* Adults (ages 19-64), Children (ages 4-18), Senior citizens (ages 65 and older)<br>* Free admission: Preschoolers (ages 3 or under) / Free admission does not apply to groups of children<br>* Seniors citizens: ID required|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Sheep feeding area, royal azalea field, thached-roof house, marsh, walking trails, rest area, etc.|\n|Reservation Info. for Natives:|Reservations not accepted|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1583621_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1583621_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1583624_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1583624_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1583625_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1583625_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1583627_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1583627_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1890726_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1890726_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1890727_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1890727_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1890728_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1890728_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1890729_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1890729_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1890731_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658777504093/1890731_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-33-335-1966](tel:+82333351966)\n- [üè†www.yangtte.co.kr]( http://www.yangtte.co.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.6876427505\nlongitude: 128.7533288363\ntitle: 483-32, Daegwallyeongmaru-gil, Pyeongchang-gun, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus + Taxi]<br>\nFrom Dong Seoul Bus Terminal, take an intercity bus to Hoenggye Intercity Bus Terminal.<br>From Hoenggye Bus Terminal, take a taxi to the ranch.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-25-1658777504093","title":"Daegwallyeong Sheep Ranch (ÎåÄÍ¥ÄÎ†π ÏñëÎñºÎ™©Ïû•)","description":"Daegwallyeong Sheep Ranch is a privately owned ranch on an area of 195 k„é°.

It is the most famous place for fall colors in Seoraksan Mountain, and its handsome valley and rock formations are well-known as well. Its name, Jujeongol, is said to come from the Joseon-era bandits that are said to have settled in the area, making their living with counterfeit (ju) coins (jeon) while disguised as Buddhist monks. Osaek (meaning ‚Äúfive colors‚Äù) was inspired by the five colors of Jujeongol‚Äôs rock formations, and the five-colored tree that is said to have lived in Osaekseoksa Temple of the past. A 3.2 km-long trail brings visitors along the rising rocks next to the valley, connecting Seongguksa Temple and Seonnyeotang Pothole to Yongso Falls Information Center. It is a relatively flat, 1 hr-long course with many wooden decks that help to make it more accessible for the visitors. The entrance to the trail is the location of the Osaek Mineral Spring, whose natural carbonation and iron content impart a unique flavor in the water. Keep your eyes open for strange rock formations like Gorae, Sangtu, and Bubu Rocks, as well as Namseorak‚Äôs famous sights like Seonnyeotang Pothole, Geumgangmun Gate, and Yongso Falls.","regDate":"2022-10-07","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Valleys"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-07-1665140056405/1955866_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-07-1665140056405"},{"id":"2022-10-07-1665136282609","title":"Ojukheon House (Í∞ïÎ¶â Ïò§Ï£ΩÌóå)","description":"Ojukheon House was where Yi I (penname Yulgok; scholar and politician of the Joseon Period) was born.
