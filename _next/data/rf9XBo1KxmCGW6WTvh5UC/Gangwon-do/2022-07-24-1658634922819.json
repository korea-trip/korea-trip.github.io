It is a rapid means of traveling between downtown Sokcho and Abai Village along the 50 m-long waterway. This small barge-style boat without an engine can be run by pulling the wire manually. When fixing the solid steel wire on both sides of the waterway and pulling it hard with a hook, a boat moves forward slowly. As there is no boatman, passengers need to work together to move the boat. It takes about 5 min to cross the water by boat. This unique experience still attracts many tourists to Sokcho. Furthermore, it is known as the filming location for the Korean TV drama Autumn in My Heart, so many tourists from Japan and China visit the place.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|accomcount:|About 30 people|\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-33-635-2003|\n|parking:|Available (Capacity: about 50 small vehicles)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Film Locations:|\"Autumn in my Heart (2000)\"|\n|Facility Utilization Fees:|- Route: Cheongho-dong - Jungang-dong <br>- Operating hours: 04:30-23:00 <br>- Fare (one-way basis): Adults 500 won / Children 300 won / Handcart ¬∑ Bike 500 won|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-24-1658634922819/166463_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658634922819/166463_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658634922819/209268_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658634922819/209268_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658634922819/209764_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658634922819/209764_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658634922819/209773_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658634922819/209773_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658634922819/483577_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658634922819/483577_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658634922819/483580_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658634922819/483580_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658634922819/677177_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658634922819/677177_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658634922819/677179_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658634922819/677179_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658634922819/677180_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658634922819/677180_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658634922819/677181_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658634922819/677181_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-33-635-2003](tel:+82336352003)\n- [üè†www.abai.co.kr](http://www.abai.co.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 38.2028631815\nlongitude: 128.5922246895\ntitle: 39, Jungangbudu-gil, Sokcho-si, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\n From Dong Seoul Bus Terminal or Seoul Express Bus Terminal, take an express bus to Sokcho Intercity Bus Terminal or Sokcho Express Bus Terminal.<br>\n - Walk approx. 10-15 min to Sokcho Harbor.<br> - The ferry dock is at the end of the harbor.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-24-1658634922819","title":"Abai Village Ferry (ÏïÑÎ∞îÏù¥ÎßàÏùÑ Í∞ØÎ∞∞)","description":"Gaetbae (boat without engine) is an exotic means of transportation to cross the Abai Village at the mouth of Cheongchoho Lake.

It is also the origin of most of Seoraksan Mountain‚Äôs famous valleys, like Cheonbuldong and Gayadong Valleys. Because of erratic weather and low temperature, Daecheongbong Peak is often covered in snow from late October to late spring. Its ridges are populated by Siberian dwarf pine, Hairy Korean rhododendron, Ermans birch, and subalpine trees, making it a valuable source for alpine plant research. Four trails in the Seoraksan National Park take the visitors to this peak, through Osaek, Baekdam, Seorak-dong, and Osaengnyeong (Hangyeryeong) Pass. The shortest trail is the 5 km-long Osaek Trail (Osaek ‚Äì Seorak Falls ‚Äì Daecheongbong Peak), taking about 4 hr in total. The management controls entry to Seoraksan National Park depending on weather conditions and period, so visitors are advised to check the real-time information provided at its webpage (www.knps.or.kr).","regDate":"2022-10-26","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-26-1666774080396/780821_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-26-1666774080396"},{"id":"2022-10-26-1666770117736","title":"Robot Studio (ÌÜ†Ïù¥Î°úÎ¥áÍ¥Ä)","description":"Robot Studio is an experiential exhibition hall that presents a vision of the future robotics, featuring experiment robots, robot avatars, and reproduction of movie scenes.

The people of Yangyang know the pass as Osaengnyeong, while in Inje it is known as Hangyeryeong. Yi Jung-hwan, a late Joseon period scholar and the author of the geographical text Taengniji (On Selecting a Village), counted Osaengnyeong Pass as the first and the foremost of the six famous passes in Gangwon-do. Indeed, Osaengnyeong Pass was the route through which essential supplies were transported from Yangyang (in Yeongdong) to Inje (in Yeongseo region), and the rough pass taken by the people of Yangyang on the way to Seoul. Its presence in the folklore of the region can be seen in the popular song Hangyeryeong, which speaks to the difficulties of those who had to climb the pass. Hangyeryeong Road was opened in 1981, and today‚Äôs National Road No. 44 is famous for being a driving course through the beauty of Seoraksan Mountain. This is also the starting point of the shortest route to Daecheongbong Peak, the highest peak in Seoraksan Mountain, and the trail to the summit of Jeombongsan Mountain.","regDate":"2022-10-25","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-25-1666695146080/182107_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-25-1666695146080"},{"id":"2022-10-25-1666691767359","title":"Naksan Beach (ÎÇôÏÇ∞Ìï¥ÏàòÏöïÏû•)","description":"Naksan Beach is one of the most famous beaches in Yangyang, located in Joseon-ri, Yangyang-eup, Yangyang-gun, Gangwon-do.

As hinted by its names meaning bare mountain, there are few trees near its summit. Locals also refer to it as Eoksaesan (silver grass) Mountain because of the waves of eulalia covering its sides. The mountain remains this way because villagers burned the fields once a year to encourage the growth of wild herbs.<br><br>The mountain‚Äôs gradual slope offers an enjoyable trekking experience for hikers of all levels. In mid-October, waist-high silver grass is indeed everywhere, making it challenging for hikers to view the surrounding areas. Fortunately, certain spots near the peak offer breathtaking views of the gentle ridges and flowing hillsides.<br><br>Silver grass begins blooming in September and reaches peak colors between October and November. The Silver Grass Festival is held on Mindungsan Mountain every October, attracting hundreds of thousands of attendees for a wonderful outdoor hiking experience and picturesque photo opportunities. The mountain is easily accessible by train allowing visitors from near and far to enjoy the fall colors.<br><br>On the outskirts of Mindungsan Mountain near Balgudeok village is Goebyeonggol Valley, which contains magnificent rock formations and limestone caves. Other nearby attractions include Hwaam Yaksu (spring water site), Auraji Naruteo famous for creating Jeongseon Arirang (a local version of the traditional folk song, Arirang), and Gariwangsan Mountain (known for wild ginseng).","regDate":"2022-10-25","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-25-1666688500348"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
