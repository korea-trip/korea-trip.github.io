The cave was designated Natural Monument No. 260 in 1979.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-33-560-2379|\n|parking:|Available (Small vehicles 67 parking spaces / Large vehicles 6 parking spaces)|\n|restdate:|Monday (Tuesday if a holiday falls on Monday), January 1, the day of Seollal (Lunar New Year's Day) & Chuseok (Korean Thanksgiving) holidays|\n|usetime:|* Cave exploration: 09:00-15:00 <br />* Visitors must arrive at least 20 minutes before departure <br />* Scheduled tours departing 14:40 & 15:00 will not be in operation during winter|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Management office, parking lot, rest plaza, etc|\n|Facility Utilization Fees:|Adults - Individuals 15,000 won / Groups 10,000 won<br>Children & Teenagers - Individuals 10,000 won / Groups 7,000 won<br><br>* Groups: 20 people or more|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Reservation Info. for Natives:|On-site ticket sales: 1st (09:00), 2nd (09:30), 11th (14:00), 12th (15:00) tours<br>* Visitors with reservations for accommodations within the Maha-ri Ecology Park will be given priority,<br><br>Online reservations: 3rd-7th (10:00, 10:30, 11:00, 11:30, 12:30) tours<br>* Total of 20 tickets sold per tour<br><br>Package tours: 8th-10th (13:00, 13:20, 13:40) tours<br>* Tickets can be purchased through the Maha-ri Eoreumchi Vilalge website only.|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-10-21-1666338656222/2353727_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-21-1666338656222/2353727_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-21-1666338656222/2353729_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-21-1666338656222/2353729_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-21-1666338656222/2353730_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-21-1666338656222/2353730_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-21-1666338656222/2353732_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-21-1666338656222/2353732_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-33-560-2379](tel:+82335602379)\n- [üè†www.paleozoicgp.com](http://www.paleozoicgp.com/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.2779144274\nlongitude: 128.5770904015\ntitle: 63, Munhui-gil, Pyeongchang-gun, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Dong Seoul Bus Terminal, take a bus to Pyeongchang Bus Terminal.<br>\nFrom Pyeongchang Bus Terminal Bus Stop, take a local bus bound for Baeknyong Cave and get off at Baeknyong Cave Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-10-21-1666338656222","title":"Baengnyongdonggul Cave-Gangwon Paleozoic Geopark (Î∞±Î£°ÎèôÍµ¥-Í∞ïÏõêÍ≥†ÏÉùÎåÄ Íµ≠Í∞ÄÏßÄÏßàÍ≥µÏõê)","description":"Baengnyongdonggul Cave is a 1.8„éû-long, natural limestone cave located in Pyeongchang-gun, Gangwon-do.

It is the centerpiece of the 40 km2-wide Seoraksan National Park and the dividing point between Naeseorak and Oeseorak areas  areas to the west of Daecheongbong Peak toward Inje are considered Naeseorak, while the areas to the east, toward Sokcho and Goseong, are considered as latter. It is also the origin of most of Seoraksan Mountain‚Äôs famous valleys, like Cheonbuldong and Gayadong Valleys. Because of erratic weather and low temperature, Daecheongbong Peak is often covered in snow from late October to late spring. Its ridges are populated by Siberian dwarf pine, Hairy Korean rhododendron, Ermans birch, and subalpine trees, making it a valuable source for alpine plant research. Four trails in the Seoraksan National Park take the visitors to this peak, through Osaek, Baekdam, Seorak-dong, and Osaengnyeong (Hangyeryeong) Pass. The shortest trail is the 5 km-long Osaek Trail (Osaek ‚Äì Seorak Falls ‚Äì Daecheongbong Peak), taking about 4 hr in total. The management controls entry to Seoraksan National Park depending on weather conditions and period, so visitors are advised to check the real-time information provided at its webpage (www.knps.or.kr).","regDate":"2022-10-26","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-26-1666774080396/780821_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-26-1666774080396"},{"id":"2022-10-26-1666770117736","title":"Robot Studio (ÌÜ†Ïù¥Î°úÎ¥áÍ¥Ä)","description":"Robot Studio is an experiential exhibition hall that presents a vision of the future robotics, featuring experiment robots, robot avatars, and reproduction of movie scenes.

The people of Yangyang know the pass as Osaengnyeong, while in Inje it is known as Hangyeryeong. Yi Jung-hwan, a late Joseon period scholar and the author of the geographical text Taengniji (On Selecting a Village), counted Osaengnyeong Pass as the first and the foremost of the six famous passes in Gangwon-do. Indeed, Osaengnyeong Pass was the route through which essential supplies were transported from Yangyang (in Yeongdong) to Inje (in Yeongseo region), and the rough pass taken by the people of Yangyang on the way to Seoul. Its presence in the folklore of the region can be seen in the popular song Hangyeryeong, which speaks to the difficulties of those who had to climb the pass. Hangyeryeong Road was opened in 1981, and today‚Äôs National Road No. 44 is famous for being a driving course through the beauty of Seoraksan Mountain. This is also the starting point of the shortest route to Daecheongbong Peak, the highest peak in Seoraksan Mountain, and the trail to the summit of Jeombongsan Mountain.","regDate":"2022-10-25","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-25-1666695146080/182107_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-25-1666695146080"},{"id":"2022-10-25-1666691767359","title":"Naksan Beach (ÎÇôÏÇ∞Ìï¥ÏàòÏöïÏû•)","description":"Naksan Beach is one of the most famous beaches in Yangyang, located in Joseon-ri, Yangyang-eup, Yangyang-gun, Gangwon-do.

The 4 kilometer-long sand beach contrasts magnificently with the lush pine trees of the area. The water is less than 1.5 meter deep, making it a good place for all ages. Naksanhang Port marks one end of the beach, behind which Naksan Mountain, the location of Naksansa Temple, can be found. The other end has a lake formed at the delta of Namdaecheon Stream, which originates from Seoraksan Mountain.

As hinted by its names meaning bare mountain, there are few trees near its summit. Locals also refer to it as Eoksaesan (silver grass) Mountain because of the waves of eulalia covering its sides. The mountain remains this way because villagers burned the fields once a year to encourage the growth of wild herbs.<br><br>The mountain‚Äôs gradual slope offers an enjoyable trekking experience for hikers of all levels. In mid-October, waist-high silver grass is indeed everywhere, making it challenging for hikers to view the surrounding areas. Fortunately, certain spots near the peak offer breathtaking views of the gentle ridges and flowing hillsides.<br><br>Silver grass begins blooming in September and reaches peak colors between October and November. The Silver Grass Festival is held on Mindungsan Mountain every October, attracting hundreds of thousands of attendees for a wonderful outdoor hiking experience and picturesque photo opportunities. The mountain is easily accessible by train allowing visitors from near and far to enjoy the fall colors.<br><br>On the outskirts of Mindungsan Mountain near Balgudeok village is Goebyeonggol Valley, which contains magnificent rock formations and limestone caves. Other nearby attractions include Hwaam Yaksu (spring water site), Auraji Naruteo famous for creating Jeongseon Arirang (a local version of the traditional folk song, Arirang), and Gariwangsan Mountain (known for wild ginseng).","regDate":"2022-10-25","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-25-1666688500348"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
