On the right-hand side, inside the a cave, is a uniquely designed Buddhist sanctum, while situated just in front of the main sanctuary is a three-story pagoda with four lions.  The four lions&nbsp;symbolize joy, anger, sadness, and happiness. Other special sites at the temple are the 108 stairs and stone lanterns lining the rocky landscape.  After going down the 108 steps, one will be delighted with the beauty of the temple.  Midway down the 108 steps one can stop and enjoy the calming sounds of the waves,  and view the majestic sunrise. <br><br>Many people often come to this spot on New Year's Day to make a wish for the new year as they watch the sun come up.  April is an especially beautiful time of year with cherry blossoms in full bloom.  The birth of Buddha is also celebrated in the fourth month of the lunar calendar and offers a spectacular night view as the temple area is aglow with lit lanterns.","regDate":"2022-08-18","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Busan","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-18-1660865869848/1571031_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Busan/2022-08-18-1660865869848"},{"id":"2022-08-18-1660862399797","title":"Dongnaeeupsong Fortress Site (동래읍성지)","description":"Dongnaeeupsong Fortress Site is a representative fortress that combined the mountain and flatland.
