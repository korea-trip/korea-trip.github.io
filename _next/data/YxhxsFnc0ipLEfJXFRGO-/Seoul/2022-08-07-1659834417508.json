The sand was used to create what seems like an island floating in the middle of the Hangang River. Nodeulseom Island was left abandoned for the next 50 years until 2005, when the Seoul Metropolitan Government purchased the property. After a series of planning and changes, the island was open to the public in 2019 as a recreational area while preserving most of its original form. Nodeulseom Isand's main attractions consist of a live house, bookstore, music lounges, garden, and more, serving as a cultural entertainment spot to the public.&nbsp;<br>\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-2-749-4500|\n|opendate:|2019ÎÖÑ 09Ïõî 28Ïùº|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|Mondays, New Year's Day, & the day of Seollal (Korean New Year's Day) and Chuseok (Korean Thanksgiving Day)|\n|usetime:|[Outdoors] Open 24 hr<br> [Indoor facilities] 09:00-21:30<br> [Cultural facilities] 12:00-20:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Shopping Information:|Souvenir shop, bookstore, restaurants, cafes, etc.|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Activity Fees:|Varies by program<br>* Refer to the official website and social media channel|\n|Facility Utilization Fees:|Varies by facility<br>* Refer to the official website|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638956_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638956_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638960_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638960_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638963_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638963_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638966_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638966_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638967_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638967_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638968_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638968_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638970_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638970_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638976_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638976_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638980_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638980_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638958_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638958_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-2-749-4500](tel:+8227494500)\n- [üè†nodeul.org ](http://nodeul.org/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5177234407\nlongitude: 126.9580659298\ntitle: 445, Yangnyeong-ro, Yongsan-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-07-1659834417508","title":"Nodeulseom Island (ÎÖ∏Îì§ÏÑ¨)","description":"Originally called Jungjido Island until the 1950s, Nodeulseom Island was a sandy plain used for recreational purposes until the areas of Hangang River underwent development in the '60s and '70s.
