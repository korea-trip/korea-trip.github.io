After he lost his mother, he built the pavilion to mourn at her grave while still being able to see his father‚Äôs grave in Gaeseong to the North. His brother-in-law, then Minister of the Interior, Gang Sa-deok named the pavilion ‚ÄúHyosajeong,‚Äù which means pavilion of filial piety.\n <br><br>\nIn order to find the original location of the pavilion, poems by Jeong Inji and Seo Geojeong and an old map of Korea were referenced, but the pavilion was not found because the surrounding landscape had changed too much. As a result, a location was selected and the pavilion was reconstructed at its current location. The house is 3 kan* in the front and 2 kan* on the side. The roof is a hip-and-gable roof. The pavilion has one room with under floor heating and a railing around the pavilion\n<br><br>\n(* kan: a traditional measurement that corresponds to the space between two columns)\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-2-820-9848|\n|opendate:|1993|\n|parking:|Not available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Open 24 hr|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-04-1659578777450/2530964_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659578777450/2530964_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659578777450/2530966_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659578777450/2530966_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659578777450/2530968_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659578777450/2530968_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659578777450/2531089_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659578777450/2531089_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659578777450/2531090_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659578777450/2531090_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659578777450/2531092_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659578777450/2531092_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659578777450/2531093_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659578777450/2531093_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659578777450/2531095_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659578777450/2531095_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659578777450/2531097_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659578777450/2531097_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659578777450/2531085_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659578777450/2531085_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-2-820-9848](tel:+8228209848)\n- [üè†tour.dongjak.go.kr](http://tour.dongjak.go.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5106549012\nlongitude: 126.9627629237\ntitle: 55, Hyeonchung-ro, Dongjak-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway]<br>\nHeukseok (Chung-Ang Univ.)
