The preservation value of this area is especially high as the valley is home to a large colony of salamanders, which are indicator species of the clean water and a protected wildlife species of Seoul. <br><br>\n\nThe valley gets its name from the site of a villa of Yi Hangbok. The path along the area’s thick forest and natural valleys provides an excellent getaway. Since the area is a habitat to several protected species, visitors are asked to refrain from dipping their feet in the valley’s waters while exploring the scenery.
