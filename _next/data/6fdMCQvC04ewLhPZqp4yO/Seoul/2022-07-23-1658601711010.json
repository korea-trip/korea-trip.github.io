Red pine trees salvaged from the demolition of Gyeongungung Palace were used to construct the house. It was originally located in Jegi-dong, Dongdaemun-gu, but was later restored and moved to its present location. The shrine of the house that was destroyed in 1960 was also restored. <br>\nBecause the house is more of a shrine rather than residential living quarters, it has many unique features. For example, unlike other houses, it has the <em>anchae</em> (women’s quarters) located across from <em>sarangbang</em> (men’s quarters) with <em>daecheong</em> (living room) positioned between them.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-2-3396-5882|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-23-1658601711010/1569164_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658601711010/1569164_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658601711010/1569165_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658601711010/1569165_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658601711010/1569167_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658601711010/1569167_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658601711010/2531125_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658601711010/2531125_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658601711010/2531126_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658601711010/2531126_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658601711010/2531128_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658601711010/2531128_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658601711010/2531129_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658601711010/2531129_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658601711010/2531130_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658601711010/2531130_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658601711010/2531131_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658601711010/2531131_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658601711010/2531132_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658601711010/2531132_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-2-3396-5882](tel:+82233965882)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5583638148\nlongitude: 126.9944031366\ntitle: 28, Toegye-ro 34-gil, Jung-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway]<BR>\nChungmuro Station (Seoul Subway Line 3, 4), Exit 3 or 4.<br>\nWalk for approx. 85 m to Namsangol Hanok Village.<br>\nHaepungbuwongun Yun Taekyeong's Jaesil is located inside Namsangol Hanok Village.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-23-1658601711010","title":"Haepungbuwongun Yun Taekyeong's Jaesil (해풍부원군윤택영댁재실)","description":"Haepungbuwongun Yun Taekyeong's Jaesil is a shrine house built by the father-in-law of King Sunjong of Joseon dynasty in 1906 when his daughter was proclaimed the crowned princess of Joseon and entered Changdeokgung Palace to later become Queen Sunjeong.
