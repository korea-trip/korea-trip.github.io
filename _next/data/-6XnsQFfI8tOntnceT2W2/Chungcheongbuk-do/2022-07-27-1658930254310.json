The church was dedicated to the Virgin Mary due to the priest's prayers to the Blessed Mother to provide the land for the church. <br><br>\nThe church has a long history spanning over 100 years. It was reportedly used as a shelter for local citizens from North Korean soldiers returning north during the end of the Korean War. The current structure was built in 1930, designed after the Myeong-dong Cathedral in Seoul. Also on the church grounds is Maegoe Museum, originally the house of Father Bouillon, which is now converted into a museum showing the history of this small, yet important Cathedral.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-43-881-2808|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-27-1658930254310/1075107_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-27-1658930254310/1075107_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-27-1658930254310/1075168_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-27-1658930254310/1075168_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-27-1658930254310/1075178_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-27-1658930254310/1075178_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-27-1658930254310/1075192_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-27-1658930254310/1075192_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-27-1658930254310/1075215_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-27-1658930254310/1075215_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-27-1658930254310/1075220_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-27-1658930254310/1075220_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-27-1658930254310/1075304_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-27-1658930254310/1075304_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-27-1658930254310/1075311_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-27-1658930254310/1075311_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-27-1658930254310/1075339_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-27-1658930254310/1075339_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-27-1658930254310/1075345_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-27-1658930254310/1075345_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-43-881-2808](tel:+82438812808)\n- [üè†www.maegoe.com](http://www.maegoe.com/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.1213983401\nlongitude: 127.6411569266\ntitle: 10, Seongdang-gil, Eumseong-gun, Chungcheongbuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Dong Seoul Bus Terminal, take an intercity bus to Gamgok Intercity Bus Terminal.<br>\nFrom Gamgok Intercity Bus Terminal, walk approx. 800m to Gamgok Maegoe Virgin Mary Catholic Cathedral.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-27-1658930254310","title":"Gamgok Maegoe Virgin Mary Catholic Cathedral (Í∞êÍ≥°Îß§Í¥¥ÏÑ±Î™®ÏàúÎ°ÄÏßÄÏÑ±Îãπ)","description":"Gamgok Cathedral was founded in 1896 by Father Camillus Bouillon, who came to Korea from France directly after gaining his priesthood.
