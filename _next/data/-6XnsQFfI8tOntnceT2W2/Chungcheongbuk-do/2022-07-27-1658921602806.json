The biggest rock is called Janggunbong (Husband Rock), the rock on the left side which appears to be showing coquetry is called Cheopbong (Mistress Rock), and the rock on the right side which is turning away from the big rock is called Cheobong (Wife Rock). The peaks are said to represent an angry wife turning away from her husband who has taken a concubine in order to secure a male heir. It is said that Jeong Do-jeon, a politician who made contributions to the establishment of the Joseon dynasty, spent his young days here and used 'Sambong' as his pen name.\n<br><br>Surrounding the three peaks is a musical fountain which was set up in 1998. The fountain serves as a great place for tourists to relax, especially during the nighttime as the fountain water cascade to the music playing in the background.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<BR>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-42-422-3037|\n|parking:|Available (Inquiries: +82-43-421-3182)|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Film Locations:|\"1 Night, 2 Days\"|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Available Facilities:|Musical fountain, cruise ship, etc.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Small vehicles & vans (15-person capacity or less) 3,000 won<br><br>Buses (16-person capacity or more) 6,000 won|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Guide in English, Japanese, & Chinese available from Danyang Tourist Center.|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-27-1658921602806/2618366_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-27-1658921602806/2618366_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-27-1658921602806/2618367_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-27-1658921602806/2618367_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-27-1658921602806/2618368_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-27-1658921602806/2618368_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-27-1658921602806/2618369_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-27-1658921602806/2618369_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-27-1658921602806/2618370_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-27-1658921602806/2618370_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-42-422-3037](tel:+82424223037)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.0034471349\nlongitude: 128.3432416782\ntitle: 644-33, Sambong-ro, Danyang-gun, Chungcheongbuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Taxi]<br>\nApprox. 5 min from Danyang Intercity Bus Terminal.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-27-1658921602806","title":"Dodamsambong Peaks (도담삼봉)","description":"Dodamsambong Peaks refer to the three stone peaks rising out of the Namhangang River.
