It is Branch Temple No.16 of the Korean Buddhist order, Jogyejong, and manages temples in Uiseong, Andong, Yeongju, Bonghwa, and Yeongyang. <br><br>Befitting its meaning, the temple is surrounded by outstanding scenery on Deungunsan Mountain, meaning “Riding on the Clouds.”  Quite isolated from villages, the temple is a very quiet, serene place.<br><br>Gounsa Temple is home to one of the most cherished pieces of architecture, Gaunru Pavilion (“Floating over the Clouds”). This elegant pavilion is propped up by wooden columns, which are, in turn, supported by foundation stones. It looks as if the pavilion placed its feet in the water while standing.<br><br>Among the many buildings comprising the temple complex, Yeonsujeon Hall is a unique building that was built to store Eocheop (the genealogical record of royal families) in 1774 (20th year of King Yeongjo). As a royal building, it shows the Confucian architectural style, different from other Buddhist buildings within the temple.","regDate":"2022-12-08","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-08-1670470704932/721738_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-08-1670470704932"},{"id":"2022-12-07-1670409526753","title":"Turtle Rock & Natural Wild Juniper Habitat (거북바위 및 향나무 자생지 (울릉도, 독도 국가지질공원))","description":"Turtle Rock was given its name for its rock formation that resembles the shape of turtles climbing out to the rock.
