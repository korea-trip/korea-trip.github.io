Ganghwasanseong Fortress originally had interior and exterior walls, but only the interior wall remains today.  It has an approximate circumference of 1.2km.  The exterior mud wall was approximately 9km in circumference with 8 gates.  The huge exterior wall was built along the side of the east channel of Ganghwa, but no longer exists today.  From 1977, the interior wall has been rebuilt many times over, but the east side of this wall has yet to be reconstructed.  <br><br>There were four main gates in the wall.  To the south, Anparu; to the east, Cheomhwaru; to the west, Manghanru; and to the north, Jinsongru. At the west gate, the historic Yeonmudang still remains.
