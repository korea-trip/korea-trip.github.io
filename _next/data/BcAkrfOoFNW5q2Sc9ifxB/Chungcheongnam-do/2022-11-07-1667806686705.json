The ferry passes various historical sites within Busosanseong Fortress, including Cheonjangdae Cliff, Nakhwaam Rock, Joryongdae Cliff, and Jaondae Cliff. Of these sites, Nakhwaam Rock (Falling Flower Rock) is perhaps the most famous, being known as the location where many Baekje women jumped from the cliff rather than be taken captive when the dynasty fell to invading forces. Another key site is Goransa Temple, home to a fountain of natural spring water that was said to prevent aging.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-41-835-4689,<br>+82-41-835-4690|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round; excluding temporary closure due to flooding)|\n|usetime:|[General Ferry] Depart when at least 7 adults have boarded<br>[Traditional Sailboat] Depart when at least 30 adults have boarded|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|[Gudeurae-Goransa]<br />Round-trip - Adults 7,000 won / Children 3,500 won<br />One-way - Adults 5,000 won / Children 2,500 won<br /><br>[Tradittional Sailboat  (round-trip)]<br />13,000 won<br /><br>[Gudeurae-Cheonjeongdae-Goransa (round-trip)]<br />Adults 13,000 won / Children 6,500 won<br /><br>[Gudeurae-Cheonjeongdae-Goransa (one-way)]<br />Adults 10,000 won / Children 5,000 won<br /><br>* Admission to Busosanseong Fortress charged separately|\n|Reservation Info. for Natives:|Phone reservation accepted for Traditional Sailboat|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-07-1667806686705/1601189_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-07-1667806686705/1601189_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-07-1667806686705/1601191_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-07-1667806686705/1601191_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-07-1667806686705/1601192_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-07-1667806686705/1601192_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-07-1667806686705/1601193_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-07-1667806686705/1601193_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-07-1667806686705/1601194_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-07-1667806686705/1601194_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-41-835-4689](tel:+82418354689)\n- [üè†tour.buyeo.go.kr](http://tour.buyeo.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.2921557103\nlongitude: 126.9152116634\ntitle: Buso-ro, Buyeo-gun, Chungcheongnam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nTake an intercity bus from Seoul Nambu Terminal to Buyeo Intercity Bus Terminal.<br>\n- Take a taxi to Busosanseong Fortress (5min).<br>\n- Follow the directions inside the fortress to reach Goransa Temple.<br>\n- The ferry dock is at the riverside.\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-07-1667806686705","title":"Goransa Ferry (Í≥†ÎûÄÏÇ¨Ïú†ÎûåÏÑ†)","description":"Goransa Ferry is the best way to understand the history of the Baekje dynasty while enjoying the still waters of Baengmagang River.

Twice a year (once in the summer and once in the winter) a 3-month program is held for foreign monks and nuns to come and practice Ganhwaseon, a type of Zen Buddhism. Travelers and other foreigners are also welcome to participate in shortened versions of the program, which are typically one week in length. During meditation/program periods, public visits are limited. The temple‚Äôs yearly schedule is divided into three sections with the last section providing various events and programs including weekend events and workshops.

The fortress is estimated by some to have been built around AD 538 to protect Sabi (now Buyeo), which was once the capital of the Baekje kingdom (18 BC-AD 66). Other historians, however, believe that the fortress was already in place by AD 500 and modified in 605 into the structure we see today. In either case, some parts of the fortress were reconstructed during the Unified Silla period (676-935) and modified again in the Goryeo (918-1392) and Joseon (1392-1910) eras. <br><br>Busosan Mountain is home to historic landmarks from the Baekje kingdom, including the archaeological site in Gwanbuk-ri, located just in front of Buseosanseong Fortress. Within the fortress, some of the most famous sites include Baekhwajeong Pavilion, Sajaru Pavilion, Banwollu Pavilion, Yeongillu Pavilion, Samchungsa Shrine (dedicated to three loyal subjects of the Baekje kingdom), Gungnyeosa Shrine, Goransa Temple, Gunchangji (military warehouse site), and Suhyeoljugeoji (site of pit houses for the Baekje soldiers). The mountain is also home to Nakhwaam Rock where, according to legend, 3,000 women of the Baekje kingdom threw themselves into the river below after the collapse of the empire.","regDate":"2022-11-08","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Fortresses"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-08-1667881274866/1598872_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Chungcheongnam-do/2022-11-08-1667881274866"},{"id":"2022-11-07-1667814061458","title":"Gudeurae Park (Íµ¨ÎìúÎûòÏ°∞Í∞ÅÍ≥µÏõê)","description":"Located at the western end of Busosan Mountain along the Baekma River, the Gudeurae region boasts beautiful scenery and a well-developed sculpture park. The port in the region acted as an entrance to the Sabi Castle during the Baekje dynasty and today serves as a dock for the cruise ship that travels up and down the Baekma River. Restaurants serving delicious regional cuisine are located near the dock, making the area a recommended tourist location for visitors who are looking for a combination of natural beauty and flavorful culinary delights. <br><br>Gudeurae was designated a Korea tourist region in 1985. Following the official designation, a sculpture park housing 59 sculptures was established in the area. Thirty of the works of art were crafted by sculptors residing in Gudeurae who are known for skills that have been handed down from artists dating back to the Baekje Period. The other 29 pieces are from Korean and overseas artists who participated in the International Modern Sculpture Symposium in 1999. The sculptures bring about a sense of beauty that reflects the region‚Äôs history as well as modern art, making the park a popular tourist site and retreat for residents. A monument built in memory of a well-known folk song describing the beauty of Gudeurae is also located in the region.","regDate":"2022-11-07","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-07-1667814061458/1954533_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Chungcheongnam-do/2022-11-07-1667814061458"},{"id":"2022-11-07-1667810992863","title":"Goransa Temple (Í≥†ÎûÄÏïΩÏàò)","description":"Goransa Temple is located at the foot of the cliffs of Nakhwaam before the Baengmagang River.

First five tombs were made using the traditional Baekje-style design while tomb number six and the Royal Tomb of King Muryeong was made using the Chinese-influenced design.
