The large site is filled with traces of Baekje culture. Sabigung Palace is a reconstruction of a real royal palace from the Three Kingdoms period. Neungsa Temple, a royal temple representing the Baekje period, has been recreated according to the real size based on excavation research done at the historic site in Neungsan-ri, Buyeo-eup. Just inside Daetongmun Gate is the Five-story Stone Pagoda, the most prominent structure in the complex. Wiryeseong Fortress, built during the Hanseong Baekje Era, gives a different aspect of Baekje in comparison with Sabigung Palace from the Late Baekje Era. A panorama of the complex can be seen from Jehyangnu Pavilion.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|expagerange:|Open to visitors ages 7 and older|\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-41-408-7290|\n|restdate:|Mondays (open if Monday is a public holiday)|\n|usetime:|March-October 09:00-18:00<br>November-February 09:00-17:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Tour Course Information:|* Course  1 (Duration: 1 hr)<br> Baekje History & Culture Museum (3D viewing) ‚Üí Jeongyangmun Gate‚Üí Cheonjeongjeon Hall ‚Üí Neugsa Temple ‚Üí Living Culture Village ‚Üí Jeongyangmun Gate<br><br> * Course 2 (Duration: 2 hr)<br> Jeongyangmun Gate‚Üí Cheonjeongjeon Hall‚Üí Neungsa Temple ‚Üí Living Culture Village ‚Üí Wiryeseong Fortress  ‚Üí  Jeongyangmun Gate‚Üí Baekje History & Culture Museum<br><br>* Course 3 (Duration:  3 hr)<br> Jeongyangmun Gate ‚Üí Cheonjeongjeon Hall ‚Üí Neungsa Temple ‚Üí Gobun Park ‚Üí Jehyangnu Pavilion ‚Üí Living Culture Village ‚Üí Wiryeseong Fortress  ‚Üí Jeongyangmun Gate ‚Üí Baekje History & Culture Museum|\n|Film Locations:|Variety program \"Running Man\"|\n|Admission Fees:|[Baekje Cultural Land & Baekje History & Culture Museum]<br>Individuals - Adults 6,000 won / Teenagers 4,500 won / Children 3,000 won<br>Groups - Adults 4,500 won / Teenagers 3,000 won / Children 1,500 won<br> <br>[Baekje History & Culture Museum]<br>Individuals - Adults 2,000 won / Teenagers 1,500 won / Children 1,000 won<br>Groups - Adults 1,500 won / Teenagers 1,200 won / Children 800 won<br> <br> * Groups: 20 or more people<br> * Adults (ages 19-64) / Teenagers (ages 13-18) / Children (ages 7-12) <br> * Free admission (ID required): Preschoolers (ages 6 & younger), senior citizens (ages 65 & older)|\n|Available Facilities:|Museum shop, restaurant, snack bar, rest area, facilities rental service (wheelchair, baby carriage, etc.), unmanned bike rental|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Available in English & Japanese<br>  Inquiries: +82-41-635-7740|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1099667_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1099667_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1099690_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1099690_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1099717_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1099717_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1099783_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1099783_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1099798_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1099798_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1601228_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1601228_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1601229_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1601229_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1601231_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1601231_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1601233_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1601233_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1601234_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1601234_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-41-408-7290](tel:+82414087290)\n- [üè†www.bhm.or.kr](http://www.bhm.or.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.3065816893\nlongitude: 126.9067759265\ntitle: 455, Baekjemun-ro, Buyeo-gun, Chungcheongnam-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-28-1659004863960","title":"Baekje Cultural Land (Î∞±Ï†úÎ¨∏ÌôîÎã®ÏßÄ)","description":"Baekje Cultural Land is the largest history-themed park in Korea, built to share the beautiful culture of the Baekje Kingdom with the world.

Travelers and other foreigners are also welcome to participate in shortened versions of the program, which are typically one week in length.

The fortress is estimated by some to have been built around AD 538 to protect Sabi (now Buyeo), which was once the capital of the Baekje kingdom (18 BC-AD 66). Other historians, however, believe that the fortress was already in place by AD 500 and modified in 605 into the structure we see today. In either case, some parts of the fortress were reconstructed during the Unified Silla period (676-935) and modified again in the Goryeo (918-1392) and Joseon (1392-1910) eras. <br><br>Busosan Mountain is home to historic landmarks from the Baekje kingdom, including the archaeological site in Gwanbuk-ri, located just in front of Buseosanseong Fortress. Within the fortress, some of the most famous sites include Baekhwajeong Pavilion, Sajaru Pavilion, Banwollu Pavilion, Yeongillu Pavilion, Samchungsa Shrine (dedicated to three loyal subjects of the Baekje kingdom), Gungnyeosa Shrine, Goransa Temple, Gunchangji (military warehouse site), and Suhyeoljugeoji (site of pit houses for the Baekje soldiers). The mountain is also home to Nakhwaam Rock where, according to legend, 3,000 women of the Baekje kingdom threw themselves into the river below after the collapse of the empire.","regDate":"2022-11-08","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Fortresses"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-08-1667881274866/1598872_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Chungcheongnam-do/2022-11-08-1667881274866"},{"id":"2022-11-07-1667814061458","title":"Gudeurae Park (Íµ¨ÎìúÎûòÏ°∞Í∞ÅÍ≥µÏõê)","description":"Located at the western end of Busosan Mountain along the Baekma River, the Gudeurae region boasts beautiful scenery and a well-developed sculpture park. The port in the region acted as an entrance to the Sabi Castle during the Baekje dynasty and today serves as a dock for the cruise ship that travels up and down the Baekma River. Restaurants serving delicious regional cuisine are located near the dock, making the area a recommended tourist location for visitors who are looking for a combination of natural beauty and flavorful culinary delights. <br><br>Gudeurae was designated a Korea tourist region in 1985. Following the official designation, a sculpture park housing 59 sculptures was established in the area. Thirty of the works of art were crafted by sculptors residing in Gudeurae who are known for skills that have been handed down from artists dating back to the Baekje Period. The other 29 pieces are from Korean and overseas artists who participated in the International Modern Sculpture Symposium in 1999. The sculptures bring about a sense of beauty that reflects the region‚Äôs history as well as modern art, making the park a popular tourist site and retreat for residents. A monument built in memory of a well-known folk song describing the beauty of Gudeurae is also located in the region.","regDate":"2022-11-07","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-07-1667814061458/1954533_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Chungcheongnam-do/2022-11-07-1667814061458"},{"id":"2022-11-07-1667810992863","title":"Goransa Temple (Í≥†ÎûÄÏïΩÏàò)","description":"Goransa Temple is located at the foot of the cliffs of Nakhwaam before the Baengmagang River.
