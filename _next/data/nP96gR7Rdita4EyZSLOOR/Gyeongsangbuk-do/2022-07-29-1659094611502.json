The temple was built in year 634, during the third year of Queen Seondeok's rule. Prominent Buddhist priests Wonhyo and Jajang resided at the temple. While the stone pagoda is presumed to be originally a 5-9 story structure, only 3 stories remain today. Much of the damage to the padoga happened during the Imjin War (1592-1598). During restoration work in 1915, money from the Goryeo period was discovered, providing evidence that the temple was also under repair at that time. Additional relics include Hwajaengguksabibu (a memorial stone placed in memory of Wonhyo), Samnyongbyeoneojeong (a well in which the three dragons that protected Silla were believed to reside), and the Standing Buddha of Bunhwangsa Temple, Gyeongsangbuk-do Cultural Heritage No. 319.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-54-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-54-742-9922|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|08:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|[Cultural Site Admission Fee]<br>Individuals - Adults 1,300 won / Teenagers 1,000 won / Children 800 won<br>Groups - Adults 1,300 won / Teenagers 900 won / Children 700 won<br><br>* Groups: 20 people or more<br>* Adults (ages 19-64) / Teenagers (ages 13-18) / Children (ages 8-12)<br>* Free admission: Senior citizens (ages 65 and over)|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Tour guide service available (Contact Gyeongju City Hall)|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-29-1659094611502/1032154_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659094611502/1032154_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659094611502/1032157_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659094611502/1032157_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659094611502/1200604_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659094611502/1200604_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659094611502/1200605_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659094611502/1200605_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659094611502/1200606_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659094611502/1200606_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659094611502/1200607_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659094611502/1200607_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659094611502/1200608_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659094611502/1200608_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659094611502/1200609_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659094611502/1200609_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659094611502/1200610_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659094611502/1200610_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659094611502/1200611_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659094611502/1200611_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-54-742-9922](tel:+82547429922)\n- [üè†www.bunhwangsa.org](http://www.bunhwangsa.org/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.8408129777\nlongitude: 129.2336990840\ntitle: 94-11, Bunhwang-ro, Gyeongju-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Dong Seoul Bus Terminal, take a bus to Gyeongju Express Bus Terminal.<br>\nFrom Gyeongju Express Bus Terminal, take Bus No. 10, 70 or 100 and get off at Gyeonggo-Sageori Bus Stop. <BR>\nWalk to Bunhwangsa Temple.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-29-1659094611502","title":"Bunhwangsa Temple (Î∂ÑÌô©ÏÇ¨)","description":"Bunhwangsa Temple is located next to Hwangnyongsa Temple Site in Gyeongju, and is famous for Stone Brick Pagoda, National Treasure No. 30.
