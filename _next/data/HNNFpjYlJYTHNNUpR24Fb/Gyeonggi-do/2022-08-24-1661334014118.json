It is also on the way to Geumgangsan Mountain. Godaesan is ideal for mountain hiking because of its  natural beauty and well-preserved \necosystem. Moreover, this is the only mountain in South Korea on which the North Korean territory can be seen. <br><br>\n\nThere are several theories about the origin of the mountain's name. One is that the mountain had been referred to as \"keungore\" (big whale) in the past by local residents. Another is that the mountain looks like the \nbanggorae (smoke duct) of a traditional Korean heating system when seen from the Sintan area; this is because the mountain's deep valleys resemble the furrows under that house that facilitate the passage of hot air to heat the room above. On a topographic map, the mountain was also marked as \"Gotae\" (like the constellations high above). <br><br>\n\nGodaesan also has a dense forest, making it a suitable source of timber and charcoal. Because of its abundant forest resources, a jumak (a tavern or inn that served food and liquor and provided lodging to travelers) village was formed here. The place was well-known for \ncharcoal production prior to the Korean War.\n<br><br>\nOn November 4, 1907, 150 soldiers from the Korean militia fought a fierce battle with the 8th Company of the Japanese Army's 20th Infantry Regiment in Yeoncheon. After the fight, the Korean militia were scattered throughout  the jumak village. Later on, 60 of them engaged in a \nfierce battle again with the Japanese soldiers on Godaesan. This is a place imbued with the brave spirit of the Korean people.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-31-839-2061|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Mountain Not Access Period:|Spring: Feburary 1 - May 15 <br>Fall: November 1 - December 15<br>* Period subject to change|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-24-1661334014118/1859992_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-24-1661334014118/1859992_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-31-839-2061](tel:+82318392061)\n- [üè†www.yeoncheon.go.kr](https://www.yeoncheon.go.kr/tour/index.do)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 38.1973005094\nlongitude: 127.1520647128\ntitle: Sinseo-myeon, Yeoncheon-gun, Gyeonggi-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-24-1661334014118","title":"Godaesan Mountain (Í≥†ÎåÄÏÇ∞)","description":"Godaesan Mountain (alt. 832 meters) is located next to Sintan-ri Station, which is the railroad disconnection point of the Gyeongwon Line.

Jarasum consists of four islands called Dongdo, Seodo, Jungdo, and Namdo, and has various leisure and park facilities. Visitors can find a car camping site and the filming location of the popular TV drama series 'Iris' on Seodo (west island), and an eco-cultural park with a grass plaza of over 100 meters in diameter on Jungdo (central island).
