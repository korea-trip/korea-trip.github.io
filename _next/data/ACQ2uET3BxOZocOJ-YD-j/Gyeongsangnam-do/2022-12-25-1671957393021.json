He is also known as King Guhae or King Yang, and is the grandfather of Kim Yoo Shin. Since becoming the King of Gaya in 521 AD, he reigned for 11 years until he handed over his country to King Beopheung of the Silla Kingdom in 532 AD.<br><br>There are two different scholarly opinions  about this tomb. One is that it should be classified&nbsp;as a stone pagoda and the other, a royal tomb. The reason why this was regarded as a pagoda is that there are similarly shaped stone pagodas in the Andong and Uiseong regions. The basis for it being called Wangreung, or royal tomb, is that there is a record in Dongguk Yeoji Seongram (an ancient history book published during the rule of King Seongjong in the Joseon dynasty) and in Saneum-hyeon Sancheonjo (a record of events in the region) of it being a tomb. The notes state that there is a structure with steps on the four faces, in the form of nine dragons piled up of stones at a distance of about 16 km (40 ri&nbsp;in traditional Korean scale) from the village, so people believe it must be a royal tomb.<br><br> The record describing the name of the king buried in this tomb can be extracted from a record of travels called Wangsan Shimreunggi written by Hong Ui Young, a Joseon dynasty scholar. In addition, there‚Äôs also an entry&nbsp; in Wangsansagi, a book on the history of Wangsansa Temple (a temple located  west of the tomb) that the person buried in the tomb is King Guhyeong.<br><br>Unlike ordinary graves, the tomb is built at&nbsp;the middle part of the hills slope. The tomb has a unique appearance made up of steps and layers, with the highest point being 7.15 meters high. There are seven layers at the front and no steps at the back due to it being built on an inclined surface. The overall shape of this tomb is different from the pyramids built on level ground.  The top of the tomb is  oval in shape. At the center, there is a stone tablet with the words Royal Tomb of King Yang of the Garak Nation. In front of the tomb, there are several stone pieces that have been added to the original tomb. <br><br>During the 17th Year of King Jeongjo of the Joseon dynasty (1793), a wooden box that was passed down from generation to generation in Wangsansa<i> </i>Temple was discovered. The box contained portraits of King Guhyeong and his queen, their clothes, an archery bow, and other objects. To preserve these, a royal building called Deogyangjeon Hall was constructed. To this date, a memorial service is held here in spring and autumn of every year.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-55-970-6411~4|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Night-time Hike Restriction Notice:|Night-time hiking is restricted for safety and forest fire prevention reasons|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-25-1671957393021/211626_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-25-1671957393021/211626_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-25-1671957393021/211627_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-25-1671957393021/211627_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-25-1671957393021/487643_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-25-1671957393021/487643_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-25-1671957393021/487644_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-25-1671957393021/487644_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-25-1671957393021/792946_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-25-1671957393021/792946_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-25-1671957393021/792956_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-25-1671957393021/792956_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-25-1671957393021/792964_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-25-1671957393021/792964_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-25-1671957393021/792979_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-25-1671957393021/792979_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-25-1671957393021/792989_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-25-1671957393021/792989_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-25-1671957393021/211625_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-25-1671957393021/211625_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-55-970-6411](tel:+82559706411)\n- [üè†www.sancheong.go.kr/tour/index.do</a> (Korean only)<br /><a href=\"http://www.cha.go.kr/\" target=\"_blank\" >www.cha.go.kr](http://www.sancheong.go.kr/tour/index.do)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.4493504251\nlongitude: 127.8006607897\ntitle: Guhyeongwangneung-ro, Sancheong-gun, Gyeongsangnam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>From Seoul Nambu Terminal, take an intercity bus to Sancheong Intercity Bus Terminal.<BR> Cross the street and at Sancheong Terminal Bus Stop, take a bus bound for Sancheong-Banggok (Hwagae) and get off at Gu-a Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-25-1671957393021","title":"Tomb of King Guhyeong, Sancheong (ÏÇ∞Ï≤≠¬†Ï†Ñ¬†Íµ¨ÌòïÏôïÎ¶â)","description":"This stone grave is known to be the tomb of King Guhyeong, the 10th King of the Gaya Kingdom.

The Daeseong-dong Tumuli are located in the center of the shell mounds of Hoehyeon-ri, the location of the founding of the Gaya Kingdom according to local legend.<br><br>The tumuli relics were excavated by researchers from the Kyungsung University Museum from 1990 to 1992 and were found to be the common burial ground of the dominant class of the Gaya Kingdom. On the hilltops, which were viewed as prime burial places, are the tombs of kings and rulers; on the slopes are the tombs of the lower classes. <br><br>A total of 136 tumuli were found in the Daesong-dong area. Further investigation of the tumuli revealed several important and interesting facts. First, from the end of the third century, men and horses were buried alive along with the dead. Also, weapons were bent and buried as well, with many of these artifacts being unearthed among the tumuli. Other materials found in the tumuli such as cylindrical bronze items, pinwheel-shaped bronze items, and jasper items showed that Gaya was involved in trade with Japan. The Daeseong-dong Tumuli is significant in that it gives a glimpse into the political and social structure of the Gaya Kingdom, and the cultural exchange between Korea, China, and Japan.","regDate":"2022-12-27","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-27-1672119336198"},{"id":"2022-12-27-1672115914882","title":"Yeonhwasan Provincial Park (Ïó∞ÌôîÏÇ∞ÎèÑÎ¶ΩÍ≥µÏõê)","description":"Yeonhwasan Mountain, located in Goseong, Gyeongsangnam-do, is just 524 meters tall, encompasses the three peaks of Ongnyeobong, Seondobong and Mangseonbong, and is widely recognized as an important provincial park.

Although Yeonhwasan Mountain is called a mountain, the gentle slopes and ridges are more similar to those of a hill. Unlike other mountains where the purpose lies in trekking and climbing to the mountain summit, the most fruitful experience one can get from exploring Yeonhwasan Mountain is a visit to Okcheonsa Temple.
