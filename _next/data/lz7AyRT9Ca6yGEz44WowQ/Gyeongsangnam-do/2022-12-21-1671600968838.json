The 16-kilometer valley stretching from Uitan of Macheon-myeon to Cheonwangbong Peak is characterized by very tough topography but beautiful scenery and is the only remaining primeval forest of Jirisan Mountain. It is also dotted with seven waterfalls and 33 ponds. The hike becomes more difficult as the trail enters the valley. Because the valley has taken many lives, some people call it The Valley of Death. For that reason, visitors must apply in advance and hike with a guide. The trail in Chilseon Valley is a 9.4-kilometer course from Chuseong Village in Macheon-myeon to Cheonwangbong Peak, which does not follow the natural valley, due to the valleys steep and dangerous features. Starting from Chuseong Village, the trail passes Yongso Pond, Jujiteo Site, Chuseongmang Rock, Seonnyeotang Pond, Ongnyeotang Pond, Biseondam, Chilseonpokpo Falls, Daeryukpokpo Falls, Samcheungpokpo Falls and Mapokpo Falls, all before reaching Cheonwangbong Peak.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-55-970-1000|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Parking Fees:|[Hourly Parking]<br>* Applies to Jeongnyeongchi, Seongsamjae Pass, Ssanggyesa Temple Parking Lots<br>Compact cars - First hour 500 won / 100 won for each additional 10 min<br>Sedans - First hour 1,100 won /250~300  won for each additional 10 min<br>Large vehicles - First hour 2,000 won / 400~500 won for each additional 10 min<br><br>[Flat Rate Parking]<br>* Applies to Hakcheon, Dalgung, Banseon, Daewonsa Temple, Hwaeomsa Temple, Yeongoksa Temple, Siamjae Pass Parking Lots<br>Compact cars - 2,000 won<br />Sedans - Peak season 5,000 won / Off season 4,000 won<br />Large vehicles - Peak season 7,500 won / Off season 6,000 won|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-21-1671600968838/2616997_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-21-1671600968838/2616997_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-21-1671600968838/2616998_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-21-1671600968838/2616998_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-21-1671600968838/2616999_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-21-1671600968838/2616999_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-21-1671600968838/2617005_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-21-1671600968838/2617005_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-55-970-1000](tel:+82559701000)\n- [üè†jiri.knps.or.kr](http://jiri.knps.or.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.3624199518\nlongitude: 127.7212089674\ntitle: Chuseong-ri, Hamnyang-gun, Gyeongsangnam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Taxi]<br>\nApprox. 30 min from Hamyang Terminal\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-21-1671600968838","title":"Jirisan Chilseongyegok Valley (Ïπ†ÏÑ†Í≥ÑÍ≥°(ÏßÄÎ¶¨ÏÇ∞))","description":"Chilseongyegok Valley is the most beautiful valley in Jirisan Mountain, and is one of the top three valleys in the nation, along with Cheonbuldonggyegok Valley in Seoraksan Mountain and Tamnagyegok Valley in Hallasan Mountain.
