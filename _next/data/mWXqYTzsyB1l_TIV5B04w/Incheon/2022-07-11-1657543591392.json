Prior to the establishment of Gyeongin Railroad, this alley was Incheon‚Äôs representative road to Seoul, referred to as Ugakli Street. During the 60s and 70s when living was difficult and everything was hard to get one's hands on, it was the only secondhand bookstore alley in the Incheon area where people could quench their thirst for learning. Known as the Baedari Bookstore Alley, there are about 10 bookstores altogether within the area that sell secondhand books and new books. Countless books in a wide range of topics from ancient Korean literature, arts, music, medicine, children‚Äôs books, dictionaries and more fill up the small but charming bookstores. Artworks that depict the old lifestyles of residents at Baedari decorate the alley walls, offering more to see.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-32-770-6100|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-11-1657543591392/2030737_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-11-1657543591392/2030737_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-11-1657543591392/2476148_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-11-1657543591392/2476148_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-11-1657543591392/2476154_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-11-1657543591392/2476154_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-11-1657543591392/2476165_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-11-1657543591392/2476165_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-32-766-9523](tel:+82327669523)\n- [üè†www.icdonggu.go.kr](http://www.icdonggu.go.kr/open_content/culture/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.4724368725\nlongitude: 126.6362715334\ntitle: 6, Geumgok-ro, Dong-gu, Incheon\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Dong Incheon Station.<br>\nBus No. 9, 10, 15, 27, 28<br>\nBound for Baedari<br><br>\n\nFrom Dowon Station.<br>\nBus No. 9, 10, 15, 27, 28<br>\nBound for Baedari\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-11-1657543591392","title":"Baedari Secondhand Bookstore Alley (Î∞∞Îã§Î¶¨ ÌóåÏ±ÖÎ∞© Í≥®Î™©)","description":"Baedari Secondhand Bookstore Alley is located in the boundary between Geumgok-dong and Changyeong-dong in Dong-gu, Incheon.

Its architectural features include a paljak (traditional Korean half-hipped roof) and supporting columns  rendered in Jusimpo style, the column brackets  placed only on top of the columns. The palace was built in the tradition of dwelling houses such as the Yeongyeongdang and Nakseonjae houses in Changdeokgung Palace, so the palace buildings give off a simple and plain atmosphere.

This fish was related to the family of fish commonly called drums, croakers, or hardheads for the repetitive throbbing or drumming sounds they make. When the economy flourished thanks to profitable fishing, the Socheongdo port was congested with fishing boats, so much that it was said that one could cross from one island to the next by walking over boats. The species of fish is depleted, and the island remains as quiet with views of North Korea.<br><br>In November 2010, Socheongdo Island was hit by the fatal shelling from North Korea that killed two civilians and two soldiers. In recent months, the island has made an attempt to recover its tourism industry and to develop security tourism by blending its newer military presence at tourist attractions.","regDate":"2022-08-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-12-1660340265213/1385383_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-08-12-1660340265213"},{"id":"2022-08-12-1660336750306","title":"Yeonan Pier (Ïó∞ÏïàÎ∂ÄÎëê)","description":"Yeonan Pier is the starting point for all coastal passenger ships bound for the numerous islands in the western sea.
