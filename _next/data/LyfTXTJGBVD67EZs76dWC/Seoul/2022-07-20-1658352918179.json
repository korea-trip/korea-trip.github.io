The bell would ring 33 times at 4 AM, signaling the start of the day and the opening of the city gates. At 10 PM, the bell would ring 28 and the gates would close for the night. The bell was originally installed at Wongaksa Temple in 1468, in the 13th year of King Sejo, but was moved to its current location in 1619. The bell has high cultural value due to the exact year of construction being known, allowing historians to accurately date artifacts from the same time period. The original bell, National Treasure No. 2, is preserved in the National Museum of Korea.<br><br>\n\nTourists to Jongno-gu and locals alike can enjoy a living history through the bell-ringing ceremony that takes place for one hour every day (excluding Mondays), starting at 11:20. In addition, Bosingak Belfry is the location of Korea's very own \"ball drop ceremony\" on December 31. On this evening, the streets surrounding the belfry are closed to traffic and people gather to ring in the New Year with the striking of the bell.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-2-2133-2641|\n|parking:|Not available (public transportation recommeded)|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Open 24 hr|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Not available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-20-1658352918179/1568172_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-20-1658352918179/1568172_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-20-1658352918179/1568173_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-20-1658352918179/1568173_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-20-1658352918179/1568174_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-20-1658352918179/1568174_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-20-1658352918179/1568175_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-20-1658352918179/1568175_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-20-1658352918179/1568176_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-20-1658352918179/1568176_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-20-1658352918179/1568177_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-20-1658352918179/1568177_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-20-1658352918179/1568178_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-20-1658352918179/1568178_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-20-1658352918179/566425_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-20-1658352918179/566425_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-20-1658352918179/566426_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-20-1658352918179/566426_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-20-1658352918179/566427_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-20-1658352918179/566427_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-2-2133-2641](tel:+82221332641)\n- [üè†culture.seoul.go.kr</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.cha.go.kr/\" target=\"_blank\">www.cha.go.kr](https://culture.seoul.go.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5698150675\nlongitude: 126.9835760212\ntitle: 54, Jong-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway ]<br>\nJonggak Station (Seoul Subway Line 1), Exit 4.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-20-1658352918179","title":"Bosingak Belfry (Î≥¥Ïã†Í∞Å ÌÑ∞)","description":"Bosingak Belfry was used during the Joseon dynasty to keep the time.

It was the principal palace for many kings of the Joseon dynasty, and is the most well-preserved of the five remaining royal Joseon palaces. The palace grounds are comprised of a public palace area, a royal family residence building, and the rear garden. Known as a place of rest for the kings, the rear garden boasts a gigantic tree that is over 300 years old, a small pond and a pavilion. <br><br> The palace gained importance starting from the time of Seongjong, the 9th king of Joseon, when a number of kings began using it as a place of residence. Unfortunately, the palace was burned down by angry citizens in 1592 when the royal family fled their abode during the Imjin War. Thanks to Gwanghaegun, the palace was restored in 1611. Even today, it houses a number of cultural treasures, such as Injeongjeon Hall, Daejojeon Hall, Seonjeongjeon Hall, and Nakseonjae Hall. <br><br> Changdeokgung Palace‚Äôs garden behind the inner hall, called the Secret Garden, was constructed during the reign of King Taejong and served as a rest area for the royal family members. The garden had formerly been called Bugwon and Geumwon, but was renamed Biwon Garden, or Secret Garden, after King Gojong came into power. The garden was kept as natural as possible and was touched by human hands only when absolutely necessary. Buyongjeong Pavilion, Buyongji Pond, Juhamnu Pavilion, Eosumun Gate, Yeonghwadang Hall, Bullomun Gate, Aeryeonjeong Pavilion, and Yeongyeongdang Hall are some of the many attractions that occupy the garden. The most beautiful time to see the garden is during the fall when the autumn foliage is at its peak and the leaves have just started to fall. <br><br> Though it has been treasured by Koreans for centuries, Changdeokgung Palace was  recognized as a World Cultural Heritage site by the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Committee in December of 1997 during the committee meeting in Naples, Italy.","regDate":"2022-07-21","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Palaces"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-21-1658388852503/1568306_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-07-21-1658388852503"},{"id":"2022-07-21-1658385996535","title":"Changdeokgung Injeongmun Gate (Ï∞ΩÎçïÍ∂Å Ïù∏Ï†ïÎ¨∏)","description":"Serving as the main gate of Injeongjeon Hall, Injeongmun Gate was established in 1405 (5th year of King Taejo‚Äôs reign during the Joseon dynasty).
