The pavilion was constructed in 1419 by Hwang Hui, a noted prime minister in the early Joseon dynasty, during his exile to Namwon. The name of the pavilion at that time was Gwangtongnu. In 1434, while the pavilion was undergoing reconstruction, scholar and politician Jeong In-ji called it Gwanghallu after Gwanghancheongheobu, the mythical palace on the moon. Designated as Treasure No. 281, the pavilion is one of four major pavilions known for excellent craftsmanship, along with Yeongnamnu Pavilion (Miryang), Chokseongnu Pavilion (Jinju), and Bubyeoknu (Pyeongyang). Gwanghalluwon Garden, which consists of Gwanghallu Pavilion, a pond, Bangjangjeon Pavilion, and Yeongjugak Pavilion form Historic Site No. 33.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<BR> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-63-620-6172|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|April-October: 08:00-21:00 (18:00-21:00 Free admission)<BR>November-March: 08:00-20:00 (18:00-20:00 Free admission)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals: Adults 3,000 won / Teenagers  2,000 won / Children 1,500 won<BR>Group: Adults 2,500 won / Teenagers 1,500 won / Children 1,000  won<br><br>* Adults (ages 19-64), Teenagers (ages 13-18), Children (ages 7-12) <BR>* Group:  30 people or more<br>* Free admission: Preschoolers (ages 6 and younger) &  senior citizens (ages 65 and older)|\n|Parking Fees:|* Sedan: 2,000 won (one-day parking) / 30,000 won (monthly parking)<br>* Mini Bus (15 seats or under): 2,000 won (one-day parking) / 30,000 won (monthly parking) <br>* Bus (16 seats or more): 4,000 won (one-day parking) / 60,000 won (monthly parking) <br>* Truck (1 ton or under): 2,000 won (one-day parking) / 30,000 won (monthly parking) <br>* Truck (over 1 ton): 3,000 won (one-day parking) / 45,000 won (monthly parking)|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-31-1672457740644/2439749_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-31-1672457740644/2439749_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-31-1672457740644/2439752_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-31-1672457740644/2439752_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-31-1672457740644/2439753_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-31-1672457740644/2439753_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-31-1672457740644/2439754_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-31-1672457740644/2439754_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-31-1672457740644/2439757_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-31-1672457740644/2439757_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-31-1672457740644/2439759_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-31-1672457740644/2439759_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-31-1672457740644/2439760_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-31-1672457740644/2439760_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-31-1672457740644/2439763_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-31-1672457740644/2439763_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-31-1672457740644/2563392_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-31-1672457740644/2563392_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-31-1672457740644/2439750_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-31-1672457740644/2439750_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-63-620-6172](tel:+82636206172)\n- [🏠www.gwanghallu.or.kr](http://www.gwanghallu.or.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.4032788125\nlongitude: 127.3795269458\ntitle: 1447, Yocheon-ro, Namwon-si, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>\nFrom Central City Bus Terminal, take an express bus to Namwon Bus Terminal.<br>From Namwon Bus Terminal Bus Stop, take Bus No. 220 and get off at Nammusaga, Standardchartered Bank (Jeil Bank) Bus Stop. <br>Walk for approx. 448 m.\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-31-1672457740644","title":"Gwanghallu Pavilion (광한루)","description":"Rebuilt in 1638 (the 16th year of King Injo), Gwanghallu Pavilion is one of the Joseon dynasty’s most exemplary structures.

The mountain boasts a variety of attractions from Hyangnobong Peak (1,029 meters), Cheonilpokpo Falls, Songdaepokpo Falls, Jangdobawi Rock, Janggunbawi Rock, and Allyeomdae Cliff.<br><br>The rugged shape of the mountain was considered ideal for building a fortress. And after Jeoksangsan became a designated site for storing Joseonwangjo Sillok (annals of the Joseon Dynasty), the fortress surrounding it was further rebuilt. The mountain is also home to Anguksa Temple, an ancient temple built in 1227 (during the 3rd year of King Chungryeol’s reign) by Monk Wolin. The mountain can easily be climbed by hiking or by vehicle; there is a paved road stretching over 15 kilometers that leads to the top of the mountain thanks to the construction of Muju Power Plant, letting tourists visit Sanjeong Lake and Anguksa Temple conveniently.","regDate":"2023-01-03","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-03-1672742201681/2719978_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-03-1672742201681"},{"id":"2023-01-03-1672738548256","title":"Jeokbyeokgang Cliffs [National Geopark] (적벽강 (전북 서해안 국가지질공원))","description":"The area around Jeokbyeokgang Cliffs features great plant distribution value, including a population of Machilus, a designated natural monument.

At the time of the survey it was discovered the tombs had already been illegally excavated, most likely during the reign of King Chungsukwang of the Goryeo dynasty. Though looters had stripped the tombs of any burial accessories, the wooden coffins were found to be relatively intact. <br><br>The coffins were severely damaged in the aftermath of the Korean War, but were later restored by the Jeonju National Museum. When they were first found, the twin tombs measured 3.1 meters high and 0.5 kilometers wide, but some of the original wood was lost during the tombs’ tumultuous history and the restoration that followed. The larger of the restored tombs now measures 30 meters in diameter and 5 meters in x_height while the smaller tomb measures 24 meters in diameter and 3.5 meters in x_height. On January 21, 1963 the tombs were designated Historic Site No. 87. <br><br>The Twin Tombs are roughly 200 meters apart, with the tomb in the east called Daewangmyo (big royal tomb) and the one in the west Sowangmyo (small royal tomb). The interiors of the tombs are done in the same style as the stone chamber tombs found in the tomb cluster of Neungsan-ri, Buyeo. Considering that the nearby Mireuksaji Temple Site was built during the reign of King Mu of Baekje dynasty, it is highly likely that the Twin Tombs are those of King Mu and his wife, Queen Seonhwa.","regDate":"2023-01-03","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-03-1672731345521/1308535_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-03-1672731345521"},{"id":"2023-01-03-1672727891410","title":"Iksan Ipjeomni Ancient Tombs (익산 입점리 고분)","description":"The Iksan Ipjeomni Ancient Tombs are a group of ancient Baekje-era tumuli located 100 meters above sea level on the northeast brow of Chilmokjae Hill in Ipjeom-ri, Iksan-si, Jeollabuk-do. The burial ground covers an area of more than 18,520 square meters and is officially listed as Historical Site No. 347. To date, a total of eight tumuli have been excavated, all of which are chamber tombs. <br><br>Surprisingly enough, the tombs were first discovered in 1986 by a high school student. While digging for arrowroot, a young man from a local high school found some pieces of gold that resembled a hat. He quickly notified the authorities and it was soon discovered that the pieces of gold were in fact valuable ancient artifacts. An emergency excavation was conducted and the eight tumuli were uncovered, but unfortunately all of the tumuli except Tomb No. 1 had been severely damaged. Tomb No. 1, which is still in relatively good condition, boasts an entrance measuring an impressive 16 meters in x_height and 2 meters in x_width. <br><br>Inside the tombs archaeologists found valuable relics from the Baekje dynasty including earthenware, jewelry (a gilt-bronze hat, gold earrings, glass beads, etc.), harnesses and ironware. Given the shapes and the types of the pieces found, historians estimate that the tumuli were built in the 5th century. Since the gilt-bronze hat is similar in shape to those found in Japan, experts believe that there was an active exchange between the Baekje people and the people of Japan.","regDate":"2023-01-03","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-03-1672727891410/573722_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-03-1672727891410"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
