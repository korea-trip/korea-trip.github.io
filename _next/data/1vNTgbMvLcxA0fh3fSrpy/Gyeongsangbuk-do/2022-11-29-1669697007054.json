The building no longer exists, but the abalone-shaped stone water canal still remains, speculated to have been built during the Unified Silla period although the exact year is unknown. The water canal has an estimated length of 10 meters, with a x_width of approximately 35 centimeters and an average depth of 26 centimeters. Based on Chinese writings from 353, it is said that drinking glasses were floated on the canal. One popular party game had guests creating poems before the glass had passed nine sections of the canel. Guests who could not do this had to drink three glasses. Modern research has shown that the site was not merely a place for fun, but also served as a meeting venue for the royal family, as well as for holding memorial services.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢  For more info +82-54-745-8484|\n|parking:|Available (Small cars: 34 spaces / Large cars: 19 spaces)|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|March-October 09:00-18:00<br>November-February 09:00-17:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 2,000 won / Teenagers 1,000 won / Children 500 won<br>Groups - Adults 1,600 won / Teenagers 800 won / Children 400 won|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Small cars 2,000 won / Large cars 4,000 won|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-29-1669697007054/179844_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-29-1669697007054/179844_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-29-1669697007054/179845_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-29-1669697007054/179845_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-29-1669697007054/1200417_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-29-1669697007054/1200417_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-29-1669697007054/1200422_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-29-1669697007054/1200422_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-29-1669697007054/1200425_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-29-1669697007054/1200425_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-29-1669697007054/1200432_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-29-1669697007054/1200432_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-29-1669697007054/1200434_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-29-1669697007054/1200434_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-54-745-8484](tel:+82547458484)\n- [üè†www.gyeongju.go.kr/tour](http://www.gyeongju.go.kr/tour)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.8073108096\nlongitude: 129.2128629747\ntitle: 816, Namsansunhwan-ro, Gyeongju-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus] <br>\nFrom Dong Seoul Bus Terminal, take an intercity bus to Gyeongju Intercity Bus Terminal.\n<br>\nFrom Gyeongju Intercity Bus Terminal, take Bus No. 500 and get off at Poseokjeong Entrance Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-29-1669697007054","title":"Gyeongju Poseokjeong Pavilion Site (Í≤ΩÏ£º Ìè¨ÏÑùÏ†ïÏßÄ)","description":"Poseokjeong Pavilion served as a separate palace where kings enjoyed banquets with nobles.
