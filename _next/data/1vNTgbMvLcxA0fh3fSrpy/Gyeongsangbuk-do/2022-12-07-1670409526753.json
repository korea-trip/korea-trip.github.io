The Turtle Rock is a volcanic rock that formed from the molten lava from Ulleungdo Islands early volcanic activity. Solidified lava flow as well as chilled margins can still be seen along the rocks slope. The western cliff of the rock is Tonggumi Village, where it serves as a home to wild juniper trees. On the northwestern side of the rock is Daepunggam Village, also a natural habitat for wild juniper trees. Both sites were designated as Natural Monuments for their significance. The juniper trees here are known to have a slower growth rate than those under normal condition due to rough winds.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-33-791-2113~4|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-07-1670409526753/1162803_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-07-1670409526753/1162803_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-07-1670409526753/1162805_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-07-1670409526753/1162805_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-07-1670409526753/1162807_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-07-1670409526753/1162807_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-07-1670409526753/1162808_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-07-1670409526753/1162808_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-07-1670409526753/1162811_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-07-1670409526753/1162811_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-07-1670409526753/1162812_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-07-1670409526753/1162812_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-07-1670409526753/1162813_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-07-1670409526753/1162813_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-33-791-2113](tel:+82337912113)\n- [🏠ulleung.go.kr](http://ulleung.go.kr/geo)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.4604695311\nlongitude: 130.8583677106\ntitle: Taeha-ri, Ulleung-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Ferry + Car]<br>\n Upon reaching the island by ferry via Dodonghang Port, visitors are recommended to tour by car.<br>\n Proceed to Dodong-gil road and stay on the main circular route along the coastal line, for about 20 km.\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-07-1670409526753","title":"Turtle Rock & Natural Wild Juniper Habitat (거북바위 및 향나무 자생지 (울릉도, 독도 국가지질공원))","description":"Turtle Rock was given its name for its rock formation that resembles the shape of turtles climbing out to the rock.
