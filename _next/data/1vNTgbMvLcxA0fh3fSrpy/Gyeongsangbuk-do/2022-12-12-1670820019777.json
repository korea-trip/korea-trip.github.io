The city of Goryeong played such a central role in the development of the confederacy that many artifacts and historic sites of the Daegaya period can still be found there today. <br><br>Some of the most prominent landmarks are the 200 gobuns (ancient tombs) that lie along the southeastern slope of Jusan Mountain in Goryeong. In ancient times, the higher and larger a tomb, the higher the social status of the person buried inside. Given this tradition and historical evidence, the largest tomb in the south has been identified as Geumnim Wangneung (Royal Tomb of King Geumnim); the other large tombs are also presumed to be those of the kings of Daegaya. The large royal tombs (over 20m in diameter) dominate the mountain ridge (the highest point) while mid-sized and smaller tombs can be found on the mountain slopes and foothills. <br><br>Historical research on Daegaya began with the excavation and partial identification of the ancient tombs of Goryeong by research teams from Kyungpook National University and Keimyung University in 1977. Excavators discovered a great number of relics‚Äîgilt-bronze crowns, swords, armor, and trinkets of gold, silver, and jade‚Äîthat shed light on the flourishing culture of Gaya. <br><br>To continue to encourage interest in the history and culture of Daegaya, officials of Goryeong-gun County established the Daegaya Royal Tomb Exhibit Hall at the foot of Jusan Mountain in Gobun-gun, Jisan-dong. The exhibition hall depicts the social structure of the era through ancient customs such as burying servants alive with their dead masters.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-54-950-6363|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-12-1670820019777/1004711_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-12-1670820019777/1004711_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-12-1670820019777/1004725_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-12-1670820019777/1004725_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-12-1670820019777/1004735_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-12-1670820019777/1004735_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-12-1670820019777/1004915_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-12-1670820019777/1004915_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-12-1670820019777/1005018_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-12-1670820019777/1005018_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-12-1670820019777/1005065_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-12-1670820019777/1005065_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-12-1670820019777/1005102_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-12-1670820019777/1005102_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-12-1670820019777/2024013_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-12-1670820019777/2024013_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-12-1670820019777/2024014_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-12-1670820019777/2024014_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-12-1670820019777/1004772_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-12-1670820019777/1004772_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-54-950-6363](tel:+82549506363)\n- [üè†tour.goryeong.go.kr</a> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br><a href=\"http://www.cha.go.kr/\" target=\"_blank\">www.cha.go.kr](http://tour.goryeong.go.kr/kor/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.7250940382\nlongitude: 128.2543717249\ntitle: San 23-1, Jisan-ri, Goryeong-eup, Goryeong-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>\nFrom Seoul \nNambu Bus Terminal, take an intercity bus to Goryeong Intercity Bus Terminal. \n<br>From Goryeong Intercity Bus Terminal, take a taxi for approx. 10 min. to Jisandong Ancient Tombs.\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-12-1670820019777","title":"Jisandong Ancient Tombs (Í≥†Î†π ÏßÄÏÇ∞Îèô Í≥†Î∂ÑÍµ∞)","description":"Goryeong was the old capital of Daegaya (42-562 AD), a city-state of the Gaya confederacy that once spanned the region now occupied by Gyeongsangnam-do Province to the south of the Korean peninsula.
