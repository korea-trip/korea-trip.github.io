The lighthouse is a round, white concrete structure rising 7.6 meters high. With a new prisim light placed in 2003, the lighthouse can reach as far as 50 kilometers away. The hiking trail up to the lighthouse is a natural, narrow path among groves of trees. The gentle slope is surrounded by uniquely shaped cliffs, so it is a popular hiking course for tourists.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-54-791-5334|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-08-1670488825762/2370066_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-08-1670488825762/2370066_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-08-1670488825762/2370067_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-08-1670488825762/2370067_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-54-791-5334](tel:+82547915334)\n- [🏠www.ulleung.go.kr](http://www.ulleung.go.kr/tour/main.htm)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5204530046\nlongitude: 130.7945824886\ntitle: 188, Taehadeungdae-gil, Ulleung-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-08-1670488825762","title":"Ulleungdo Lighthouse (울릉도 등대 (태하등대))","description":"Ulleungdo Lighthouse, sometimes called Taeha Lighthouse, was first lit in 1958 as a guiding light for boats coming to and from Ulleungdo Island.
