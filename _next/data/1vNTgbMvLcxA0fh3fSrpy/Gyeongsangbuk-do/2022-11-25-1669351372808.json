Later, much of the forest was lost due to additional building construction, road expansion, and typhoon. Only some areas in front of Jacheon Village retain the old ambience.<br><br>Orijangnim Forest was established to block the strong winds from entering the village, as well as provide bank protection and flood prevention.

Although the building structures do not carry significant meaning in architectural aspect, the distinguished space arrangement of the buildings is hard to go unnoticed.
