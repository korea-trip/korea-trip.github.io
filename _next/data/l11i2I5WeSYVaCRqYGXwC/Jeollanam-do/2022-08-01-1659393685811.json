The recreational park is located on the mid-slope of Bangjangsan Mountain. Many species of wild flowers and broad-leaved trees are distributed all over Bangjangsan Recreational Forest where an exciting paragliding contest takes place annually. This is a great place to unpack and take a break for one or two days as it has accommodation facilities, promenades and trekking courses as well as a small area for splashing in the water. It takes approximately three hours to the mountain's summit from the recreational forest. In addition, there is a trekking path that leads to the Seokjeong Hot Springs on the way down the mountain.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|accomcount:|500 people for a day|\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-61-394-5523|\n|parking:|Available|\n|usetime:|Accommodations: 15:00 - 12:00 (next day)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 1,000 won / Teenagers 600 won / Children 300 won<br>Groups - Adults 800 won / Teenagers 500 won / Children 200 won<br><br>* Groups - 20 people or more<br>* Adults (ages 19-64) / Teenagers (ages 13-18) / Children (ages 7-12)<br>* Free admission December-March|\n|Facility Utilization Fees:|Accommodations: Low Season & Weekdays / Peak Season & Weekends<br><br>[Forest Cabin] <br>- Rooms (36„é°, 5 people) 46,000 won / 85,000 won<br>- Rooms (46„é°, 8 people) 77,000 won / 134,000 won<br>- Rooms (66„é°, 11 people) 91,000 won / 151,000 won<br><br>[Forest Culture Recreation Center] <br>- Rooms (23„é°~26„é°, 4 people) 39,000 won / 68,000 won<br>- Rooms (29„é°~36„é°, 5-6 people) 50,000 won / 91,000 won<br>- Rooms (49„é°~56„é°, 8-9 people) 85,000 won / 144,000 won|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Compact cars: 1,500 won <br>Small cars: 3,000 won <br>Large vehicles: 5,000 won |\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-01-1659393685811/2040885_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659393685811/2040885_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659393685811/2040890_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659393685811/2040890_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659393685811/2040894_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659393685811/2040894_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659393685811/2040895_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659393685811/2040895_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659393685811/2040898_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659393685811/2040898_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-61-394-5523](tel:+82613945523)\n- [üè†www.huyang.go.kr](http://www.huyang.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.4451632173\nlongitude: 126.7458042490\ntitle: 353, Bangjang-ro, Jangseong-gun, Jeollanam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Train] <br>\nTake a train to Baegyangsa Station from Yongsan Station (Seoul).<br>\nTake a taxi to Bangjangsan Recreational Forest from Baegyangsa Station.\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-01-1659393685811","title":"Bangjangsan National Recreational Forest (Íµ≠Î¶Ω Î∞©Ïû•ÏÇ∞ÏûêÏó∞Ìú¥ÏñëÎ¶º)","description":"Situated between Jeollanam-do and Jeollabuk-do, Bangjangsan National Recreational Forest is the highest rising peak along the ridge starting from the west of Naejangsan Mountain.

Most dinosaur tracks found in Korea are located in coastal areas in cities like Haenam and Boseong, so the discovery in the inner region of Jeollanam-do was a first. Most prints here come from carnivorous dinaosaurs of the Cretaceous period. The site is famous for there being tracks from no fewer than five different dinosaurs, as well as for being one of the longest trails and most direct examples of the exact movements of the dinosaurs. The tracks of one dinosaur are the longest in the world, stretching for 40 meters. Based on the foot size of 20-22 centimeters with a stride of approximately 90 centimeters, it is estimated that the prints were formed by a 4-5 meter tall Koolasuchus. In addition to the canivorous dinosaurs, tracks were found of 12 herbivorous dinosaurs, as well as fossilized plants. These plants offer much assistance in the research of herbivorous dinosaur diets.","regDate":"2023-01-17","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollanam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Eco-Tourism Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-17-1673944760289/1608223_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollanam-do/2023-01-17-1673944760289"},{"id":"2023-01-17-1673933770532","title":"Dasan Chodang (Historic Site Related to Jeong Yak-yong) (Îã§ÏÇ∞Ï¥àÎãπ (Îã§ÏÇ∞ Ï†ïÏïΩÏö© Ïú†Ï†ÅÏßÄ))","description":"Dasan Chodang is the house where Jeong Yak-yong (pen-name Dasan, 1762-1836) lived during his exile.
