It also served as a banquet site for important national events and important visitors. The pond was created in 674, during the reign of King Munmu. The pond features three small islands, and a landscape of 12 small hills to the northeast. After the fall of Silla, the site was abandoned and forgotten. The pond was referred to as Anapji from the Goryeo and Joseon periods and onwards. In the 1980s, a pottery fragment with the letters ‚ÄúWolji‚Äù (a pond that reflects the moon) carved onto it was found, revealing the true name of the pond. After the discovery, the site was renamed to the current Donggung Palace and Wolji Pond.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-54-750-8655, 8650|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|09:00-22:00<br>* Last admission 30 minutes before closing. <br>* Advised to purchase tickets early as site is a famous nighttime attraction.|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 3,000 won / Teenagers 2,000 won / Children 1,000 won <br>Groups - Adults 2,400 won / Teenagers 1,600 won / Children 800 won<BR>* Groups: 30 people or more|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-27-1669534579762/1613358_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-27-1669534579762/1613358_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-27-1669534579762/1613362_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-27-1669534579762/1613362_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-27-1669534579762/2612560_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-27-1669534579762/2612560_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-27-1669534579762/2612562_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-27-1669534579762/2612562_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-54-750-8655](tel:+82547508655)\n- [üè†www.gyeongju.go.kr/tour](http://www.gyeongju.go.kr/tour)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.8352023996\nlongitude: 129.2283747104\ntitle: 102, Wonhwa-ro, Gyeongju-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-27-1669534579762","title":"Gyeongju Donggung Palace and Wolji Pond (Í≤ΩÏ£º ÎèôÍ∂ÅÍ≥º ÏõîÏßÄ)","description":"Gyeongju Donggung Palace and Wolji Pond was a secondary palace used by the crown prince of the Silla Kingdom.

He looks as if he is sitting on a cloud, while the closed eyes on the plump face give the impression that he is lost in deep thought. He seems to be watching mankind from his world above the clouds. He is holding a flower in his right hand and his left hand is held up to his chest as if he is preaching.<br><br>His robe is very thin, revealing the curves of the body, and hangs down to the base of the pedestal. The mandorla (Buddhist halo of light), which consists of both the dugwang (light radiating from the head) and hte singwang (light emanating from the Buddha‚Äôs body), is also the shrine for the statue, so the image of the Bodhisattva looks more prominent. It is presumed that this rock-carved Bodhisattva was made during the late eighth century during the Unified Silla dynasty.","regDate":"2022-12-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-13-1670927944965"},{"id":"2022-12-13-1670924193942","title":"Seated Rock-carved Buddha at Golgulam Temple (Í≤ΩÏ£º Í≥®Íµ¥Ïïî ÎßàÏï†Ïó¨ÎûòÏ¢åÏÉÅ)","description":"The Seated Rock-carved Buddha at Golgulam Temple consists of a Maebul (a Buddha carved in a cliff) at the very top of 12 Buddha images carved in natural rock caves located in a steep cliff of Girimsa Valley. A painting of the caving titled Golgulseokgul by Gyeomjae Jeongseon, a famous painter of the era, revealed that there was once a wooden room located in front of the Maebul, but today only a hint of the room remains on the rock. The head of the Buddha (Yukgye) is perched solid and high on the body with a clear profile of the face ‚Äì sharp eyes, small lips and a long and narrow nose. In contrast to the three-dimensional face, the body is broader and flatter. The neck and upper chest sections have eroded over time. The folds in the clothing are nearly parallel, and the arm area has a v-pattern wrinkle, giving it a more realistic and three-dimensional quality. Around the head of the Buddha is a lotus-shaped halo, while the body is surrounded by a rhythmic flame-like halo. The Maebul is believed to have been created during the late Unified Silla Kingdom, as it shows similar craftsmanship to Seated Stone Vairocana Buddha (National Treasure No. 995), which was created in the year 876 and is located in Chukseosa Temple.","regDate":"2022-12-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-13-1670924193942"},{"id":"2022-12-13-1670920819064","title":"Sail Spa Land (ÏÇ¨ÏùºÏò®Ï≤ú)","description":"Sail Spa Land is uniquely located at the top of a mountain.
