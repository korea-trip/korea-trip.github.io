He built a small thatched hut here for a temporary stay and continued his search. Finally, he found a perfect place and built Buseoksa Temple. He also set up another temple in the site where his small thatched hut was and called it Choamsa Temple. Choamsa Temple is located below the valley in the south of Gungmangbong Peak of Sobaeksan Mountain. After the Korean War, the temple building had to be rebuilt, but it managed to preserve some of Provincial Tangible Cultural Asset including Samcheung Seoktap (a three-storied stone pagoda; Tangible Cultural Property 126), Dongbudo (East Stupa; Tangible Cultural Property 128) and Seobudo (West Stupa; Tangible Cultural Property 129).<br><br>* Jukgyegugok Valley <br>The valley stretching from Baejeom-ni to Choamsa Temple is called Jukgyegugok which Sobaeksan Mountain surrounds like a folding screen. Near the valley, one can find famous tourist attractions such as the Sosuseowon Confucian Academy and Buseoksa Temple. Toegye Yi Hwang came up with the name Jukgyegugok inspired by the fantastic scenery of the valley and the beautiful sound of the flowing water.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<BR> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-54-633-2322|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Hiking Course:|* Baejeom-ri - Jukgye Valley - Choamsa Temple - Seongnyunamgol Village - Gungmangbong Peak - Birobong Peak<br>* In front of Baejeom Elementary school - 9 Gok - 1 Gok - Choamsa Temple- Gungmangbong Peak - Birobong Peak<br /><br>* In front of Baejeom Elementary school - 9 Gok - 1 Gok-  Gungmangbong Peak- 1 Gok - 9 Gok - n front of Baejeom Elementary school |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Not available|\n  \n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-54-633-2322](tel:+82546332322)\n- [üè†www.yeongju.go.kr](http://www.yeongju.go.kr/open_content/tour)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.9441934902\nlongitude: 128.5262409259\ntitle: 330, Jukgye-ro 315beon-gil, Yeongju-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[BUs]<BR>\nFrom Dong Seoul Bus Terminal, take an intercity bus to Yeongju Bus Terminal.\n<br>From Yeongju Bus Terminal, take Bus No. 53 bound for Sosuseowon Confucian Academy and get off at Choamsa Temple BUs Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-21-1669023570827","title":"Choamsa Temple - Yeongju (Ï¥àÏïîÏÇ¨(ÏòÅÏ£º))","description":"In search of a great place to build a Buddhist Temple invoking national security, Great Monk Uisang travelled around the country and reached this place.

He looks as if he is sitting on a cloud, while the closed eyes on the plump face give the impression that he is lost in deep thought. He seems to be watching mankind from his world above the clouds.

The mandorla (Buddhist halo of light), which consists of both the dugwang (light radiating from the head) and hte singwang (light emanating from the Buddha‚Äôs body), is also the shrine for the statue, so the image of the Bodhisattva looks more prominent. It is presumed that this rock-carved Bodhisattva was made during the late eighth century during the Unified Silla dynasty.","regDate":"2022-12-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-13-1670927944965"},{"id":"2022-12-13-1670924193942","title":"Seated Rock-carved Buddha at Golgulam Temple (Í≤ΩÏ£º Í≥®Íµ¥Ïïî ÎßàÏï†Ïó¨ÎûòÏ¢åÏÉÅ)","description":"The Seated Rock-carved Buddha at Golgulam Temple consists of a Maebul (a Buddha carved in a cliff) at the very top of 12 Buddha images carved in natural rock caves located in a steep cliff of Girimsa Valley. A painting of the caving titled Golgulseokgul by Gyeomjae Jeongseon, a famous painter of the era, revealed that there was once a wooden room located in front of the Maebul, but today only a hint of the room remains on the rock. The head of the Buddha (Yukgye) is perched solid and high on the body with a clear profile of the face ‚Äì sharp eyes, small lips and a long and narrow nose. In contrast to the three-dimensional face, the body is broader and flatter. The neck and upper chest sections have eroded over time. The folds in the clothing are nearly parallel, and the arm area has a v-pattern wrinkle, giving it a more realistic and three-dimensional quality. Around the head of the Buddha is a lotus-shaped halo, while the body is surrounded by a rhythmic flame-like halo. The Maebul is believed to have been created during the late Unified Silla Kingdom, as it shows similar craftsmanship to Seated Stone Vairocana Buddha (National Treasure No. 995), which was created in the year 876 and is located in Chukseosa Temple.","regDate":"2022-12-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-13-1670924193942"},{"id":"2022-12-13-1670920819064","title":"Sail Spa Land (ÏÇ¨ÏùºÏò®Ï≤ú)","description":"Sail Spa Land is uniquely located at the top of a mountain.
