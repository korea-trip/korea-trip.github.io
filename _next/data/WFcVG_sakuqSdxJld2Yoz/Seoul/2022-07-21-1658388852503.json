It was the principal palace for many kings of the Joseon dynasty, and is the most well-preserved of the five remaining royal Joseon palaces. The palace grounds are comprised of a public palace area, a royal family residence building, and the rear garden. Known as a place of rest for the kings, the rear garden boasts a gigantic tree that is over 300 years old, a small pond and a pavilion. <br>\n<br>\n The palace gained importance starting from the time of Seongjong, the 9th king of Joseon, when a number of kings began using it as a place of residence. Unfortunately, the palace was burned down by angry citizens in 1592 when the royal family fled their abode during the Imjin War. Thanks to Gwanghaegun, the palace was restored in 1611. Even today, it houses a number of cultural treasures, such as Injeongjeon Hall, Daejojeon Hall, Seonjeongjeon Hall, and Nakseonjae Hall. <br>\n<br>\n Changdeokgung Palace‚Äôs garden behind the inner hall, called the Secret Garden, was constructed during the reign of King Taejong and served as a rest area for the royal family members. The garden had formerly been called Bugwon and Geumwon, but was renamed Biwon Garden, or Secret Garden, after King Gojong came into power. The garden was kept as natural as possible and was touched by human hands only when absolutely necessary. Buyongjeong Pavilion, Buyongji Pond, Juhamnu Pavilion, Eosumun Gate, Yeonghwadang Hall, Bullomun Gate, Aeryeonjeong Pavilion, and Yeongyeongdang Hall are some of the many attractions that occupy the garden. The most beautiful time to see the garden is during the fall when the autumn foliage is at its peak and the leaves have just started to fall. <br>\n<br>\n Though it has been treasured by Koreans for centuries, Changdeokgung Palace was  recognized as a World Cultural Heritage site by the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Committee in December of 1997 during the committee meeting in Naples, Italy.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|expagerange:|Open to visitors of all ages|\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-2-3668-2300|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|Mondays|\n|usetime:|[Palace]<br>Feb-May, Sep-Oct 09:00-18:00<br>Jun-Aug 09:00-18:30<br>Nov-Jan 09:00-17:30<br>* Last admission: 1 hour before closing<br><br>[Secret Garden Tour (Guided tour only)]<br>Mar-May, Sep-Oct 10:00-17:30<br>Jun-Aug 10:00-18:00<br>Feb, Nov 10:00-17:00<br>Dec-Jan 10:00-16:30<br>* Last tour: 1 hr 30 min before closing<BR> * Secret Garden Tour has limited space and must travel with a guide|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|[Changdeokgung Palace]<br> Adults (ages 25-64) 3,000 won / Group (over 10 people) 2,400 won<br> * Free admission to Changdeokgung Palace: Refer to the website for free admission information.<br>  <br>[Special Ticket]<br>- Long-term admission 30,000 won (General admission only) <br>* Expires one month after date of purchase / One portrait photo must be submitted / Admission available only for purchased palace<br><br>[Secret Garden Tour]<br> Adults (ages 25-64) 8,000 won<br> Young adults (ages 19-24) & Senior citizens (ages 65 & older) 5,000 won<br> Children and Teenagers (ages 7-18) 2,500 won<br> Groups of 10 people or more 7,400 won<br> * Free admission: Children (ages 6 or under) |\n|Available Facilities:|PR Hall, ticket booth, restrooms, nursing room, etc.|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|[Changdeokgung Palace Guided Tour]<br>Languages: English, Japanese, Chinese<br>* Refer to website for schedule<br>Length of tour: Approx. 60 min<br>Start point: Inside Donhwamun Gate, in front of information map<br>* Schedule and route are subject to change due to weather conditions.|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-21-1658388852503/1568306_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658388852503/1568306_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658388852503/1568307_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658388852503/1568307_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658388852503/1568308_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658388852503/1568308_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658388852503/1568309_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658388852503/1568309_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658388852503/1568310_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658388852503/1568310_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658388852503/1568311_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658388852503/1568311_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658388852503/1568357_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658388852503/1568357_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658388852503/1568358_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658388852503/1568358_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658388852503/1568359_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658388852503/1568359_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658388852503/1994246_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658388852503/1994246_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-2-3668-2300](tel:+82236682300)\n- [üè†www.cdg.go.kr](http://www.cdg.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5809583673\nlongitude: 126.9919888278\ntitle: 99, Yulgok-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-21-1658388852503","title":"Changdeokgung Palace Complex [UNESCO World Heritage] (Ï∞ΩÎçïÍ∂ÅÍ≥º ÌõÑÏõê [Ïú†ÎÑ§Ïä§ÏΩî ÏÑ∏Í≥ÑÎ¨∏ÌôîÏú†ÏÇ∞])","description":"Changdeokgung Palace was the second royal villa built following the construction of Gyeongbokgung Palace in 1405.

The tomb features three layers of stones topped by a smooth mound, which is a tomb style originating from the Goguryeo dynasty (37 BC-AD 668).
