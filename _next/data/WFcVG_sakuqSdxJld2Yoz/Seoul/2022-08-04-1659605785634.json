{"pageProps":{"content":"![Inwangsan Mountain (Ïù∏ÏôïÏÇ∞)](/2022-08-04-1659605785634/1894462_image2_1.webp)\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> The ancient fortress walls of Seoul that connect the ritual grounds of King Taejo and Muhakdaesa to the Sajik Tunnel and Jahamun Gate still remain on the grounds of Inwangsan Mountain. Many people enjoy hiking the path that begins at Sajik Tunnel, which leads to the peak of the mountain passing the fortress walls, then hike back down to Buam-dong. The hiking course is also connected to the road in front of Cheongwadae, so hikers can also walk along the historical Palpan-ro road, Hyoja-ro road, and Gyeongbokgung Palace. The hiking path located behind Sajik Park leads to Hwanghakjeong Pavilion, where archers during the Joseon dynasty once honed their marksmanship. The Hwanghakjeong Pavilion was originally located within the Gyeonghuigung Palace, but was relocated to the mountain. From the top, a panoramic view of the surrounding area spreads as far as Inwangsan Mountain, Naksan Mountain, Namsan Mountain, and Baegaksan Mountain with Gyeongbokgung Palace at its center.\n<br><br>\nThe hiking path past Sajik Park's T-intersection is a popular walking course to nearby office workers during lunch time. A view of Cheongwadae is visible from atop Beombawi Rock (tiger's rock). For hikers seeking to walk along the ridges, it is recommended to take the path down to Hongje-dong quarry or Jahamun Gate. Hikers are recommended to take their time to fully enjoy the view of the surroundings while walking along the path of the outer walls. The stone stairway following the path past Changuimun Gate will take hikers to the path along the outer walls. This path stretches for approximately 200 meters and a set of stones used to build the city walls during the reign of King Taejo, King Sejong, and King Sukjung still remain along the way. The thick, dark-colored mosses on the stones indicate the long history of Seoul.<br><br>\n\nThe view of the refreshing landscape and Inwangsan Mountain's peak will greet the hikers once they walk back to the inner city walls through a step of stones. Hikers will be able to get a bird's-eye-view of Seoul's mountains and skyscrapers surrounding the Hangang River. The city walls along the path going down to Cheongun-dong still withhold their beauty from the past.\n<br><br>\nInwangsan Mountain stands at a x_height of 338.2 meters and spreads throughout the regions of Hongje-dong in Seodaemun-gu and Muak-dong, Nusang-dong, Ogin-dong and Buam-dong in Jongno-gu. The unique and colossal rock formations and the view of Seoul and Cheongwadae are only a few of the many charms of Inwangsan Mountain.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-2-2148-2834|\n|restdate:|Mondays (If Monday is a public holiday, then closed the day after the holiday)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Benches, small performance hall, etc.|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-04-1659605785634/1880365_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659605785634/1880365_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659605785634/1894464_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659605785634/1894464_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-2-2148-2834](tel:+82221482834)\n- [üè†tour.jongno.go.kr ](http://tour.jongno.go.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5735670596\nlongitude: 126.9640832471\ntitle: 29, Inwangsan-ro 1-gil, Jongno-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway + Bus]<br>\nGyeongbokgung Station (Seoul Subway Line 3), Exit 3.<br>\nGo straight 90 m to the Gyeongbokgung Station Bus Stop.<br>\nTake Jongno Bus No. 09 and get off at Ogin APT.

It was impossible to determine the full scale of the ancient tombs in this area due to the severity of destruction. The largest tomb, the third tomb, measures 49.6 meters from east to west, 43.7 meters from south to north, and 4 meters in x_height. The tomb features three layers of stones topped by a smooth mound, which is a tomb style originating from the Goguryeo dynasty (37 BC-AD 668). The tombs are presumed to belong to one of the earliest leaders of the Baekje dynasty (18 BC-AD 660), which was founded by the people of Goguryeo who had come down southwards to establish a new kingdom around the Hangang River basin. <br><br>The square-shaped fourth tomb features a structure similar to the third tomb. Many pieces of earthenware from the early Baekje era were found in the fourth tomb. Also excavated around this site was a gold spangle earring. The third and fourth tombs have been registered as Historic Site No. 243. The tomb site offers valuable information concerning the culture and customs of the Baekje dynasty in its golden age around the 4th century, as well as the relations between the three ancient kingdoms (Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla) around that time.","regDate":"2022-08-09","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-09-1660055975519/203889_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-08-09-1660055975519"},{"id":"2022-08-09-1660053732378","title":"Seoul Sajik Park (ÏÇ¨ÏßÅÍ≥µÏõê(ÏÑúÏö∏))","description":"Sajik Park is one of the three most popular parks in Jongno-gu along with Tapgol Park and Samcheong Park.
