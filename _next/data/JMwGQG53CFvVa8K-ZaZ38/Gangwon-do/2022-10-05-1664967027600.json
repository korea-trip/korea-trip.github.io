Also known as Arcadia, scholars and poets frequented the valley in times past, and the 5,000 square meters of Mureung Rock bears the inscribed names of some of these poets and their work.

From early in the morning, merchants across the country gather at the market to purchase fresh seafood. Dried fish are also available.<br><br>Mukho Lighthouse, located atop Dongmunsan Mountain, opened in June 1963 as an unmanned lighthouse guiding ships into Mukhohang Port. The two-story lighthouse is 12 meters tall and is made from cement. The white lighthouse stands out against the blue sea and sky to create a fantastic image. The area surrounding the lighthouse has been turned into a small park. There is a large rock inscribed with a poem about the sea near the park entrance.","regDate":"2022-10-06","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-06-1665030149840/2678609_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-06-1665030149840"},{"id":"2022-10-05-1664963402353","title":"Misiryeonggyegok Valley (미시령계곡)","description":"With Seoraksan Mountain to its northeast, Misiryeonggyegok Valley stretches from Yongdae Samgeori to Dojeokpokpo Falls at the valleys peak for approximately 4.8 kilometers.
