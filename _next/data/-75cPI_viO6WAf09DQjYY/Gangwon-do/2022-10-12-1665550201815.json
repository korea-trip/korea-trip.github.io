The cable car boarding station is located in the Small Park of Seoraksan National Park. It takes about 10 min to get to the Gwongeumseong Fortress (700m above sea level) by the cable car. One-way ticket is not available, so visitors need to buy a round-trip ticket. Visitors can also enjoy an open view of various famous attractions such as Ulsan Peak and Manmulsang Rocks beyond glass window in the cable car. The Gwongeumseong Fortress, unfolding a panoramic view of Seoraksan Mountain‚Äôs majestic scenery, bears a legend in which two generals Gwon and Kim built the fortress in one day to prevent enemy invasion during the Goryeo period. Today, the site of the fortress only remains. Many hikers come up to the summit of the fortress despite its rough course to appreciate magnificent and mysterious scenery of strange rocks and bizarre stones at Seoraksan Mountain. When you are at the summit, you can see the landscape of not only the Outer Seorak but also the Inner Seorak. Below the Gwongeumseong Fortress are Allagam Hermitage built during the Silla period and Muhaksong (Korean red pine) existed for hundreds of years. As many tourists visit the mountain at weekends and during public holidays and autumn foliage season, it is recommended to schedule your trip by considering the waiting time too.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-33-636-4300|\n|parking:|Available (Seorak-dong C1 District, Seorak-dong C2 District, Seorak-dong B1 District, Seorak-dong B2 District, Seorak-dong A District, Please note that the Sorak Cablecar Company has no part in the national park parking fees and admission fees for cultural heritage areas.)|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round) <br>* Subject to closure due to bad weather conditions or regular checkups.|\n|usetime:|(Entry Hours) Winter season (04:00‚Äì12:00), Summer season (03:00‚Äì14:00)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Activity Fees:|Seorak-dong: Restaurants, cafe, gift shop, observatory<br>Gwongeumseong Fortress: Observatory, snack bar, cafe|\n|Available Facilities:|None|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Adults: 3,500 won / Youth: 1,000 won / Children: 500 won<br />Round-trip: Adults: 11,000 won / Children: 7,000 won / Toddlers (37 months old or under): Free|\n|Reservation Info. for Foreigners:|None|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|None|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-10-12-1665550201815/1949371_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-12-1665550201815/1949371_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-12-1665550201815/1950295_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-12-1665550201815/1950295_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-12-1665550201815/1950304_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-12-1665550201815/1950304_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-12-1665550201815/1950305_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-12-1665550201815/1950305_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-12-1665550201815/1950310_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-12-1665550201815/1950310_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-12-1665550201815/1950314_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-12-1665550201815/1950314_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-12-1665550201815/1950315_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-12-1665550201815/1950315_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-12-1665550201815/1950317_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-12-1665550201815/1950317_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-33-636-4300](tel:+82336364300)\n- [üè†www.sorakcablecar.co.kr](http://www.sorakcablecar.co.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 38.1730535382\nlongitude: 128.4890711013\ntitle: 1085, Seoraksan-ro, Sokcho-si, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Sokcho Terminal, take Bus No. 7 or 7-1 and get off at Seorak-dong Sogongwon Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-10-12-1665550201815","title":"Seorak Cable Car (ÏÑ§ÏïÖÏÇ∞ ÏºÄÏù¥Î∏îÏπ¥)","description":"The ideal way to comfortably appreciate the magnificent landscape of Seoraksan Mountain is using the Seorak Cable Car.

It is 500 meters in length and 55 meters in x_width, and has an average depth of 1.2 meters. The beach is particularly known for its soft and fine sand, often considered to be the best on the east coast. Despite its excellent scenery and clear water, the beach is relatively obscure and peaceful. It is only open during the daytime between July and August. The pine trees surrounding the beach are protected areas, and visitors are prohibited from entering. Surfing is another draw of the beach, and the surf shop offers lessons and equipment rentals. Scuba diving is also available on site. An interesting insight into the folk tradition is ‚Äúanchovy flinging,‚Äù a traditional method of catching anchovies that involve about 70 people working together to pull a big net from the sea to land. This experience is offered free of charge during the opening of the beach, and requires payment for periods outside the vacation season. Prior reservation is required through the official website. The beach enjoys excellent access from Yangyang International Airport and a 20-min ride from Yangyang city center. Dongho-ri Beach Campground, Seoraksan Mountain, and Osaek District can be found nearby.","regDate":"2022-10-27","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-27-1666856392287/608515_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-27-1666856392287"},{"id":"2022-10-27-1666853444875","title":"Wonju Korea Ginseng Factory (ÏõêÏ£º Í≥†Î†§Ïù∏ÏÇºÏ∞Ω)","description":"Operated by the Korea Ginseng Corporation, the Korea Ginseng Factory makes high quality Korean ginseng.

The enemy thought that he was Taejo and beheaded him, and Taejo made his head with gold in sorrow and held a funeral for him. The Tomb of Sin Sung-gyeom consists of three mounds, which are said to have been a measure that Taejo took lest the golden head should be stolen. The location of the tomb is regarded as one of the best propitious sites for a grave in Korea, based on geomancy. Surrounded by pine trees, this site overlooks downtown Chuncheon. The tombstone, shrine, and memorial stone were built around the tomb.

According to a legend, Monks Yeongseo, Hyewon, and Yeonok all had envisioned the location in their dreams in which a white-haired heavenly man appeared and indicated them the place of the temple. Thus, the temple was re-constructed at the current location and renamed as ‚ÄúSinheungsa,‚Äù meaning ‚Äúthe temple was blessed by God (sin) and became prosper (heung). However, the Chinese character sin of the temple‚Äôs name was changed in 1995 from sin meaning god to sin meaning ‚Äúnew,‚Äù wishing that the temple will revive Buddhism again in the Yeongdong area (eastern part of the Taebaek Mountain Range). Sinheungsa Temple is home to many cultural heritages including the Geungnakbojeon Hall at Sinheungsa Temple (Treasure) and the Three-story Stone Pagoda at Hyangseongsa Temple Site (Treasure), which is standing on the opposite side of Kensington Star Hotel .
