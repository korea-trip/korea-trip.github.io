It is an ancient refrigerator only in Korea. It is located in Gyeongju, the ancient capital of the Silla Era (BC57-AD935). The appearance of this wonderful vestige is humble and simple. But you will not be disappointed at the entrance of the freezer. You can feel the cold from inside the structure. Half of Seokbinggo is underground while the other half is above ground, signifying the scientific propensity of Korea. The floor, walls, and ceiling are made of granite and have an airway. The walls are covered with limestone to keep off moisture and water. The floor is slanted to allow melted ice to funnel out. Frozen ice was popular for the upper class. From historical annals, it is assumed that Seokbinggo was made at least 1,500 years ago. Seokbbingo has been designated as National Treasure No. 66.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-54-779-6100|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-05-1670218568625/2601688_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-05-1670218568625/2601688_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-05-1670218568625/2601690_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-05-1670218568625/2601690_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-54-779-6100](tel:+82547796100)\n- [🏠www.gyeongju.go.kr/tour](http://www.gyeongju.go.kr/tour)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.8332025414\nlongitude: 129.2239418227\ntitle: Inwang-dong, Gyeongju-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus + Taxi]<br>\nFrom Seoul Express Bus Terminal, take a bus to Gyeongju Bus Terminal.<br>Take a taxi for approx. 8 min.\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-05-1670218568625","title":"Seokbinggo (Stone Ice Storage) (경주 석빙고)","description":"Seokbinggo means a freezer made of rocks.
