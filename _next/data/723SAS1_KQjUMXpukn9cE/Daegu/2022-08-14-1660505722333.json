It was built by Monk Geukdal in the 15th year of King Soji‚Äôs reign (AD 493). The original name of the temple was Yugasa Temple, but Simjiwangsa rebuilt the temple under King Heungdeok (r. AD 826-836) and named it Donghwasa Temple, \nwhich means even during the winter season, the paulownia tree still blooms. The present temple was built in 1732. <Br>\n<br>\nWhen you turn the corner, the first thing that catches your eye is the Seolbeopjeon Hall. To the left of Seolbeopjeon is Daeungjeon Hall, the main building, and a path to the right leads to Geumgang Stairs. If you turn left in the direction of Daeungjeon you will see Bongseoru Pavilion, aptly named to signify a phoenix (bonghwang in Korean) with its tail pointed downward. Past Bongseoru are stairs that are typical of the ones leading into Daeungjeon, called \"Nugak Stairs\". On either side of the stairs are railings in the shape of a dragon, and in the middle of the stairs, there is a round stone marble that resembles a dragon orb, a ball often associated with dragons.  <br><Br>\nDonghwasa‚Äôs Daeungjeon is segmented into 3 sections at the front and side, and its natural looking pillars are one of its main attractions. It includes the statues of Seokgamonibul, Amitabul, and Yaksayeoraebul inside. If you walk down the stone stairs beside Bongseoru and walk along the cement road for a while, you will find the huge Seokjoyaksa Yeoraebul. Created as a prayer for reunification, this large Buddha statue is 17m high. The stone tower, stone light,  lion statue, and the lotus flower that decorate the Buddha statue are all very large in size. Behind the statue are also stones arranged in a circular form, resembling a beautiful scroll painting. These are world-class size stone artifacts.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-53-980-7900|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Sunrise - Sunset|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Hiking Course:|* Ticket Booth - Donghwasa Temple - Budoam Hermitage - Yeombulam Hermitage - Dongbong Peak (3.5km)<br /> * Gatbawi Parking Lot - Gatbawi Rock - Jeonbonjae - Dongneung - Eunhaesa Temple (5km)<br /> * Hakmyeong-dong - Gasan - Pagyejae - Dongbong Peak - Eunhaesa Temple - Parking lot|\n|Parking Fees:|Small vehicle: 2,500 won / Large vehicle: 5,000 won|\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals: Adults 2,500 won / Teenagers 1,500 won / Children 1,000 won<br> Groups: Teenagers 1,200 won / Children 800 won<br> <br> * Groups: 30 people or more|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-14-1660505722333/655645_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-14-1660505722333/655645_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-14-1660505722333/688892_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-14-1660505722333/688892_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-14-1660505722333/1574177_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-14-1660505722333/1574177_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-14-1660505722333/1574178_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-14-1660505722333/1574178_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-14-1660505722333/1574179_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-14-1660505722333/1574179_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-14-1660505722333/1574180_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-14-1660505722333/1574180_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-14-1660505722333/1574182_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-14-1660505722333/1574182_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-14-1660505722333/655669_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-14-1660505722333/655669_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-14-1660505722333/655704_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-14-1660505722333/655704_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-14-1660505722333/655714_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-14-1660505722333/655714_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n\n- [üè†www.donghwasa.net</a> (Korean only)<br> <a href=\"https://www.templestay.com/temple_info.asp?t_id=donghwasa\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"New window popup\" class=\"web\">www.templestay.com](http://www.donghwasa.net/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.9903555744\nlongitude: 128.7034886742\ntitle: 1, Donghwasa 1-gil, Dong-gu, Daegu\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Train]<br>\nTake a train from Seoul Station to Dongdaegu Station.<br><br>\n\n[Bus]<br>\nTake Express Bus No. 1 from the bus stop in front of Dongdaegu Station.<br>\n- Get off at Entrance of Donghwasa Temple Bus Stop.\n- Walk for approx. 8 min.<br><br>\n\n[Taxi]<br>\nApprox. 20 min. from Dongdaegu Station\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-14-1660505722333","title":"Donghwasa Temple (Daegu) (ÎèôÌôîÏÇ¨(ÎåÄÍµ¨))","description":"Donghwasa Temple is located on the south side of Palgongsan Mountain, about 22km northeast of Daegu.
