Even the entrance gate is shaped like a huge dolmen and the trash cans are ancient diagonal-line patterned earthenware. Archaeological Site in Amsa-dong was excavated in 1925 when a flood washed away the soil on the banks of the Hangang River and exposed a large number of diagonal-line patterned earthenware. After several excavations, the Archaeological Site in Amsa-dong was established. <br>\n<br> The site was a location for a massive colony, thus many ancient buildings, stone axes and stone arrows have been uncovered as well as countless diagonal-line patterned earthenware.  The housing site is round with a spot in the center for fire.  The site is colossal and possesses nine mud huts, two exhibition halls displaying ancient artifacts and an open mud hut where visitors can experience life in the Neolithic Era. The site offers many attractions such as mud huts and promenades. Archaeological Site in Amsa-dong is also very educational for children and families who want to learn and experience the Neolithic Age.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-2-3425-6520|\n|parking:|Available (09:30-18:00)|\n|restdate:|New Year's Day, Mondays (Close on Tuesday if Monday is a public holiday)|\n|usetime:|09:30-18:00 (Last admission 30 min before closing) <br>* Free admission: October-March 06:00-09:00 / April-September 05:30-09:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Individual - Adults  500 won / Children 300 won<BR>Groups - Adults 400 won / Children 200 won<br><br>* Adults (ages 19-64) / Children (ages 7-18)* Groups - 30 or more people <br>* Free admission: Preschoolers (ages 6 & under), Senior citizens (ages 65 & over)|\n|Available Facilities:|Exhibition Hall No. 1, No. 2, Restoration dwellings|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Compact cars 1,000 won / small cars 2,000 won / large cars (more than 25 seats) 4,000 won|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-10-1657496332644/204021_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-10-1657496332644/204021_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-10-1657496332644/204022_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-10-1657496332644/204022_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-10-1657496332644/204024_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-10-1657496332644/204024_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-10-1657496332644/204027_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-10-1657496332644/204027_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-10-1657496332644/204028_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-10-1657496332644/204028_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-10-1657496332644/204029_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-10-1657496332644/204029_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-10-1657496332644/204032_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-10-1657496332644/204032_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-10-1657496332644/204033_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-10-1657496332644/204033_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-10-1657496332644/204035_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-10-1657496332644/204035_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-10-1657496332644/221329_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-10-1657496332644/221329_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-2-3425-6520](tel:+82234256520)\n- [üè†www.sunsa.gangdong.go.kr](http://sunsa.gangdong.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5605132450\nlongitude: 127.1309239757\ntitle: 875, Olympic-ro, Gangdong-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-10-1657496332644","title":"Archaeological Site in Amsa-dong, Seoul (ÏÑúÏö∏ ÏïîÏÇ¨Îèô Ïú†Ï†Å)","description":"The Archaeological Site in Amsa-dong reproduces the lifestyle of the Neolithic Era.

It wasn't until 1593 that the palace was used as a temporary palace of the royal family after their home was burned down during the Imjin War. King Seonjo also stayed at Deoksugung Palace after returning to the city. It became a proper palace when Gwanghaegun (1575-1641) ascended to the throne and gave this royal residence the name Gyeongungung Palace in 1611. Over the following decades, the palace alternated between being an official palace and a temporary residence. The name did not change officially to Deoksugung Palace, meaning the ‚Äúpalace of virtuous longevity,‚Äù until 1907. While the palace once encompassed a vast area with many buildings, the current palace grounds are just a small shadow of the prior splendor, with very few structures remaining.","regDate":"2022-07-22","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Palaces"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1946565_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-07-22-1658472507467"}],"navList":["Busan","Daegu","Daejeon","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
