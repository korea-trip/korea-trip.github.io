Under the pen name Yeongnang, he was active in literature until his death on September 29, 1950. Among the 80 poems he published, more than 60 were written in this place where he lived a life resisting Japanese imperialism and refusing to change his name to a Japanese name. After he moved to Seoul in 1948, his birthplace was resold several times, but the county of Gangjin-gun bought it in 1985 to restore it to its original state with a thatched-roof. The site features many of the poet’s writing materials and the site has a small well, camellia trees, jangdokdae (a platform where large clay pots used for storing food are kept), persimmon trees, and a peony garden.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-61-430-3363|\n|parking:|Available (Free)|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-02-1659446456971/1606607_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659446456971/1606607_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659446456971/1606608_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659446456971/1606608_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659446456971/1606609_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659446456971/1606609_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659446456971/1606610_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659446456971/1606610_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659446456971/1606611_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659446456971/1606611_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659446456971/1606612_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659446456971/1606612_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659446456971/1606613_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659446456971/1606613_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-61-430-3185](tel:+82614303185)\n- [🏠www.gangjin.go.kr</a> (Korean, English, Chinese, Japanese)<br><a href=\"http://www.cha.go.kr/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"web\">www.cha.go.kr](http://www.gangjin.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 34.6421208134\nlongitude: 126.7651001989\ntitle: 15, Yeongnangsaengga-gil, Gangjin-gun, Jeollanam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \nFrom Seoul Central City Bus Terminal (Express Bus Terminal Station, Subway Line 3, 7, 9), take an intercity bus bound for Gangjin.<br>\n\n<br>From Gangjin Bus Terminal, Walk about 400 m following\nthe signs for Birthplace of Yeongnang.\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-02-1659446456971","title":"Birthplace of Yeongnang (강진영랑생가)","description":"Kim Yun-sik was born on this site on January 16, 1903 as the first-born of two sons and three daughters.

It is made up of 250 smaller islands, and it is famous for a strip of dry road that appears from the middle of the sea, near the end of February and mid June of the lunar calendar.  As it resembles a passage in the Old Testament in the Book of Exodus, the event is called “The Miracle of Moses.”  When the water recedes, a road about 30-40 meter wide and 2.8-kilometer long appears and stays for about an hour before being submerged again. <br><br>Jindo Island has some legends which are still popular today, especially that of “Old Woman Bbyong of Hoedongri.” A long time ago, there were many tigers on Jindo Island. When tigers began appearing frequently in the village, the people fled to Modo Island. In the process, only the old woman Bbyong ended up remaining on the island, so the lady prayed everyday to Yongwang, the god of the ocean, to let her see her family again. Around February, Yongwang appeared to her in her dream and said, “I will send a rainbow to the sea tomorrow; ride it and cross the ocean”. The next day old woman Bbyong went out to the sea and prayed again, and the seawater parted as the rainbow road appeared.  Through this road, her family and the other villagers came back to the island. Therefore when the sea parts, the people celebrate this phenomenon by holding the Yeongdeung Festival to remember the Old Woman Bbyong. During the Festival, original folk plays of Jindo Island are performed and draws many tourists into Jindo Island.","regDate":"2023-01-24","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollanam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Eco-Tourism Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-24-1674535168286/1993038_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollanam-do/2023-01-24-1674535168286"},{"id":"2023-01-24-1674531363287","title":"Jindo Island (진도)","description":"Jindo Island is the principal island among the cluster of 230 islets in the southwestern part of the Korean peninsula.
