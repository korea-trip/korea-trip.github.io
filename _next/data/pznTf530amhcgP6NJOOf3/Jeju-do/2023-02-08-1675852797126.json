Soe means an ox, so means a pool of water and kkak means the end. This is the mouth of the Hyodoncheon Stream. As the fresh water meets the ocean, it broadens into wide, slow-flowing river. Soesokkak Estuary is lined with cliffs of curious lava formations, which are overhung with pine trees. <br>It was chosen as one of hidden picturesque scenery in Chilsip-ri, Seogwi-po, comprised of deep blue ocean, uniquely-shaped rocks formed by lava and a pine forest.<br>Soesokkak Estuary is located in Hahyo-dong on the southern side of Hallasan Mountain. The area is also well-known for its tangerines, and visitors are drawn to the area by the fresh citrus scent. Popular destinations close to Soesokkak Estuary include the famous Jusang Jeolli Cliffs and Jungmun Resort, as well as Cheonjeyeonpokpo Falls.","regDate":"2023-02-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Valleys"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-13-1676270470583/1786510_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-13-1676270470583"},{"id":"2023-02-13-1676266550850","title":"Sinyang Seopji Beach (신양 섭지해수욕장)","description":"Sinyang Seopji Beach is not yet a popular tourist attraction, leaving the fine-grained, sandy beach relatively untouched. Thanks to its quiet atmosphere, the beach gives visitors a calmer, more secluded beach experience than some of the larger beaches on Jeju. <br /><br />The 80-meter-wide, crescent-shaped beach stretches for a total length of 300 meters. Bordered by waters that are only an average of one meter deep, the beach gently slopes at a five degree angle. Known for its small waves, the beach is the perfect spot for children. <br /><br />Windsurfing is available nearby and popular tourist attractions such as Seongsan Ilchulbong Tuff Cone and Seopjikoji are located in the area.","regDate":"2023-02-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-13-1676266550850/1617251_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-13-1676266550850"},{"id":"2023-02-13-1676263230667","title":"Sinsan Park (신산공원)","description":"Sinsan Park was opened to commemorate the arrival of the Olympic Torch to Korea for the 88 Seoul Olympic Games but now serves as a resting place for local citizens.

Located just south of Seongsan Ilchulbong Tuff Cone, the cape is a popular tourist attraction. The tuff cone along with a beautiful vista of the ocean and fields of canola flowers can easily be seen from the peak of Seopjikoji. On top of the hill stands a beacon fire station, reaching 4 meters in x_height with a diameter of 9 meters, built using volcanic rocks. Behind the beacon fire station is Bulgeunoreum Volcanic Cone, vibrant with red soil. The white lighthouse atop the cone stands out in contrast. Seopjikoji has been used as a filming site for many Korean movies and dramas.","regDate":"2023-02-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-12-1676198173474/2513480_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-12-1676198173474"},{"id":"2023-02-12-1676194558158","title":"Seongsan Ilchulbong Tuff Cone [UNESCO World Heritage] (성산일출봉 [유네스코 세계문화유산])","description":"Seongsan Ilchulbong Tuff Cone rose 180 meters above sea level due to a magma flow under the sea over 5,000 years ago. It was originally a separate island, but a build-up of sand and soil has connected it to the main island.  A large crater, formed by the hot lava mixing with cold ocean water, is located at the top of Seongsan Ilchulbong Tuff Cone. The crater is about 600 meters in diameter and 90 meters deep. It has been featured in films, and was originally used for agriculture, but has now been given over to a field of silver grass. From the summit, visitors can see Udo Island, as well as take in the magnificent sunrise. The tuff cone area was designated as a natural reserve on July 19, 2000.","regDate":"2023-02-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Eco-Tourism Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-12-1676194558158"},{"id":"2023-02-12-1676191105346","title":"Seongeup Folk Village (성읍민속마을)","description":"Located at the foot of Halla Mountain on Jeju Island, Seongeup Folk Village is a small town that holds a vast amount of culture over a wide period of time from 1410 to 1914.

Among the cultural gems of the folk village are intangible cultural assets such as folk plays, native foods, local folk craftsmanship, and local dialect. Even the trees are an important part of the area’s heritage. Several zelkova and nettle trees that are hundreds of years old stand at the center of the village, preserving the dignified atmosphere of a bygone era. <br><br> The Seongeup Folk Village shows the unique culture of Jeju Island.
