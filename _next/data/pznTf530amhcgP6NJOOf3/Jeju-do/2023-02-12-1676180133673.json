Seogwipo Submarine offers safe undersea tours in its recently acquired state of the art submarine from Finland. Munseom, where the submarine travels, is home to outstanding coral reefs, colorful schools of fish, and rich seaweed. The exquisite landscape makes it one of the most beautiful places to dive as well. Going deep into the 40 meter sea-bed, visitors can see countless fish, rare iridescent coral reefs, and a surreal-looking shipwreck with schools of fish surrounding it. Over 20 years of technical knowhow and safe operation (in fact, the longest submarine tour without a single accident on record) make Seogwipo Submarine a must-see attraction on Jeju Island.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-64-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-64-732-6060|\n|parking:|Available (buses 15 parking spaces, cars 70 parking spaces)|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|07:20 - 18:40 (Operates 18 times a day in 40 min intervals)<br>November-February operates until 16:00 <BR>July-August 07:45-18:50 (operates every 35 min.) <BR>* Operation subject to change|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Tour Course Information:|Route<br>Seogwipo Port (Boarding a Passenger Ferry) – Munseom (Board the Submarine) – Diver Show – Coral Garden – Getting off the Submarine – Tour in Munseom – Seogwipo Port|\n|Facility Utilization Fees:|Adults (ages 14 and older)&nbsp;55,000  won&nbsp;<br>Children (ages 3-13)&nbsp;&nbsp;36,000  won&nbsp; <br><br> *&nbsp;Please refer to the website for discount information|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-02-12-1676180133673/1618773_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-12-1676180133673/1618773_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-12-1676180133673/1618774_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-12-1676180133673/1618774_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-12-1676180133673/1618775_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-12-1676180133673/1618775_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-64-732-6060](tel:+82647326060)\n- [🏠www.submarine.co.kr](http://www.submarine.co.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.2392291431\nlongitude: 126.5587093030\ntitle: 40, Namseongjung-ro, Seogwipo-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>\nFrom Jeju International Airport, take the Airport Limousine Bus No. 600 and get off at Seogwipo Wharf Bus Stop.<br>Transfer to a bus bound for Seobugwangwang road and get off at Seogwipo Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2023-02-12-1676180133673","title":"Seogwipo Submarine (서귀포잠수함)","description":"When it opened in 1988, Seogwipo Submarine was the first of its kind in Asia and the third in the world.

Soe means an ox, so means a pool of water and kkak means the end. This is the mouth of the Hyodoncheon Stream. As the fresh water meets the ocean, it broadens into wide, slow-flowing river. Soesokkak Estuary is lined with cliffs of curious lava formations, which are overhung with pine trees. <br>It was chosen as one of hidden picturesque scenery in Chilsip-ri, Seogwi-po, comprised of deep blue ocean, uniquely-shaped rocks formed by lava and a pine forest.<br>Soesokkak Estuary is located in Hahyo-dong on the southern side of Hallasan Mountain. The area is also well-known for its tangerines, and visitors are drawn to the area by the fresh citrus scent.

Thanks to its quiet atmosphere, the beach gives visitors a calmer, more secluded beach experience than some of the larger beaches on Jeju. <br /><br />The 80-meter-wide, crescent-shaped beach stretches for a total length of 300 meters. Bordered by waters that are only an average of one meter deep, the beach gently slopes at a five degree angle. Known for its small waves, the beach is the perfect spot for children. <br /><br />Windsurfing is available nearby and popular tourist attractions such as Seongsan Ilchulbong Tuff Cone and Seopjikoji are located in the area.","regDate":"2023-02-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-13-1676266550850/1617251_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-13-1676266550850"},{"id":"2023-02-13-1676263230667","title":"Sinsan Park (신산공원)","description":"Sinsan Park was opened to commemorate the arrival of the Olympic Torch to Korea for the 88 Seoul Olympic Games but now serves as a resting place for local citizens.

The tuff cone along with a beautiful vista of the ocean and fields of canola flowers can easily be seen from the peak of Seopjikoji. On top of the hill stands a beacon fire station, reaching 4 meters in x_height with a diameter of 9 meters, built using volcanic rocks. Behind the beacon fire station is Bulgeunoreum Volcanic Cone, vibrant with red soil. The white lighthouse atop the cone stands out in contrast. Seopjikoji has been used as a filming site for many Korean movies and dramas.","regDate":"2023-02-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-12-1676198173474/2513480_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-12-1676198173474"},{"id":"2023-02-12-1676194558158","title":"Seongsan Ilchulbong Tuff Cone [UNESCO World Heritage] (성산일출봉 [유네스코 세계문화유산])","description":"Seongsan Ilchulbong Tuff Cone rose 180 meters above sea level due to a magma flow under the sea over 5,000 years ago. It was originally a separate island, but a build-up of sand and soil has connected it to the main island.  A large crater, formed by the hot lava mixing with cold ocean water, is located at the top of Seongsan Ilchulbong Tuff Cone. The crater is about 600 meters in diameter and 90 meters deep. It has been featured in films, and was originally used for agriculture, but has now been given over to a field of silver grass. From the summit, visitors can see Udo Island, as well as take in the magnificent sunrise. The tuff cone area was designated as a natural reserve on July 19, 2000.","regDate":"2023-02-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Eco-Tourism Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-12-1676194558158"},{"id":"2023-02-12-1676191105346","title":"Seongeup Folk Village (성읍민속마을)","description":"Located at the foot of Halla Mountain on Jeju Island, Seongeup Folk Village is a small town that holds a vast amount of culture over a wide period of time from 1410 to 1914.
