The street became connected samchi, or grilled seerfish, over 40 years ago with the opening House of Inha, a home-style restaurant. Originally, the street was not known for samchi, but it became one of the most popular menus at the restuarant, with many other shops in the area following in this trend. In 2002, it was designated as the grilled seerfish street and a signboard was put up at the street entrance. Currently, there are about a dozen grilled seerfish restaurants lining the street, and each restaurant has a unique signboard of its own. The fish are imported from New Zealand, and each restaurant offers a distinct taste resulting from different grilling methods and sauces. The restaurants also sell a variety of appetizers and side dishes at affordable prices.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|expagerange:|Open to visitors of all ages|\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-32-832-3031|\n|restdate:|Varies by shop|\n|usetime:|Varies by shop|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-12-1657605089652/728363_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-12-1657605089652/728363_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-12-1657605089652/728365_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-12-1657605089652/728365_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-12-1657605089652/728366_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-12-1657605089652/728366_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-32-832-3031](tel:+82328323031)\n- [üè†itour.incheon.go.kr</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.icjg.go.kr/tour/cttu0207a01\" target=\"_blank\">www.icjg.go.kr](http://itour.incheon.go.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.4757224674\nlongitude: 126.6286721359\ntitle: 57, Uhyeon-ro 67beon-gil, Jung-gu, Incheon\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway]<br>\nDongincheon Station (Seoul \nSubway Line 1), Exit 2. <br>\nTurn right, then immediately  turn left, and then go straight for about 150 m. <br>\nTurn right at the corner onto Uhyeonno 67beon-gil. <br>\n<br>\n[Bus] <br>\nDongincheon Station Bus Stop<Br>\n- Local Bus: 2, 3, 4, 6, 6-1, 10, 11, 15, 16, 17-1, 21, 21-1, 22, 23, 24, 27, 28, 41, 42, 45, 46, or 62 <br>  \n- Express bus: 105, 112, or 306\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-12-1657605089652","title":"Dongincheon Samchi Street (ÎèôÏù∏Ï≤ú ÏÇºÏπòÍ±∞Î¶¨)","description":"Dongincheon Samchi Street is located in front of Dongincheon Station in an alley to the side of Incheon Educational and Cultural Center for Students.
