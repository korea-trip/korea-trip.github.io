The street became connected samchi, or grilled seerfish, over 40 years ago with the opening House of Inha, a home-style restaurant. Originally, the street was not known for samchi, but it became one of the most popular menus at the restuarant, with many other shops in the area following in this trend. In 2002, it was designated as the grilled seerfish street and a signboard was put up at the street entrance. Currently, there are about a dozen grilled seerfish restaurants lining the street, and each restaurant has a unique signboard of its own. The fish are imported from New Zealand, and each restaurant offers a distinct taste resulting from different grilling methods and sauces. The restaurants also sell a variety of appetizers and side dishes at affordable prices.","regDate":"2022-07-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Culture/Art/History","Experience Programs","Cultural Districts"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-12-1657605089652/728361_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-07-12-1657605089652"},{"id":"2022-07-12-1657600897567","title":"Dolmen in Bugeun-ri [UNESCO World Heritage] (Í∞ïÌôî Í≥†Ïù∏Îèå Ïú†Ï†Å [Ïú†ÎÑ§Ïä§ÏΩî ÏÑ∏Í≥ÑÎ¨∏ÌôîÏú†ÏÇ∞])","description":"Dolmen in Bugeun-ri is a dolmen site in Ganghwa that is designated as Historic Site No. 137 for its historical value representing the funeral customs of the Bronze Age.
