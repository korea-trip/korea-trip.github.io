This type of technique is frequently found in those built during the Goryeo dynasty. The distinct features and carving methods that can be observed from this particular statue are speculated to be from the 11th century. Although there is a small amount of damage on the back of the head, the statue is well-preserved overall.","regDate":"2022-12-04","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-04-1670135947112/568131_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-04-1670135947112"},{"id":"2022-12-04-1670132163357","title":"Pohang Canal (Ìè¨Ìï≠Ïö¥Ìïò)","description":"Pohang Canal, completed in January 2014, cuts between Pohangs Songdo-dong and Jungdo 1-dong, connecting the waters under Dongbindaegyo Bridge with Hyeongsangang River to the south.
