The three gates of Juheulgwan, Jogokgwan, and Joryeonggwan were built for national defence after the Imjin War (1592-1598). These three gates are designated collectively as Historic Site No. 147. The area between the three gates was designated a provincial park in 1981. The path from the first gate to the last passes through beautiful forests and takes roughly four hours round-trip. Also located within the park boundaries is Mungyeongsaejae Open Set, used for filming historical dramas.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-54-571-0709|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|January 1, the day of Seollal (Lunar New Year's Day) & Chuseok (Korean Thanksgiving Day)|\n|usetime:|Open 24 hr|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Facility Utilization Fees:|[Trolley]<br>One-way: Adults 1,000 won / Teenagers 800 won / Children 500 won<br><br>* Adults (ages 19-64) / Teenagers (ages 13-18) / Children (ages 4-12)<br>* Free admission for children ages 3 & younger and their guardian (1 person)|\n|Available Facilities:|Mungyeongsaejae Open Set, Mungyeongsaejae Ecological Center, Old Trail Museum, sledding hill, etc.|\n|Parking Fees:|Compact vehicles 1,000 won / Sedan 2,000 won /  Buses (25  seats): 4,000 won|\n|Admission Fees:|[Mungyeongsaejae Provincial Park]<br>Free<br><br>[Mungyeongsaejae Open Set]<br> Individuals: Adults 2,000 won / Teenagers 1,000 won  / Children 500 won<br> Groups: Adults 1,500 won / Teenagers 800 won / Children 400  won <br> <br> [Old Trail Museum]<br> Individuals: Adults 1,000  won / Teenagers & Children 700<br> Groups: Adults 800 won / Teenagers & Children 500 won<br><br>[Mungyeongsaejae Ecological Center]<br> Individuals: Adults 2,000  won / Teenagers & Children 1,500<br> Groups: Adults 1,500 won / Teenagers & Children 1,000 won<br><br>[Mungyeongsaejae Eco Maze Park]<br>Adults 3,000 won / Teenagers 2,000 won / Children 1,500 won<br><br>* Adults (ages 19-64) / Teenagers (ages 13-18) / Children (ages 7-12)<br>* Groups: 20 people or more|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-03-1670052938039/2005737_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-03-1670052938039/2005737_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-54-571-0709](tel:+82545710709)\n- [🏠www.gbmg.go.kr](https://www.gbmg.go.kr/tour/contents.do?mId=0101010100)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.7616532703\nlongitude: 128.0770030316\ntitle: 932, Saejae-ro, Mungyeong-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-03-1670052938039","title":"Mungyeongsaejae Provincial Park (문경새재도립공원)","description":"Mungyeongsaejae Pass, which crosses Joryeongsan Mountain, has always been the highest and most dangerous mountain pass in Korea, being reputed to be too tall for even birds to fly over.

This statue is unique as the head and the body are not carved from the same rock. The head was carved from a different rock then placed over a large rock relief of the Buddhas body. This type of technique is frequently found in those built during the Goryeo dynasty. The distinct features and carving methods that can be observed from this particular statue are speculated to be from the 11th century. Although there is a small amount of damage on the back of the head, the statue is well-preserved overall.","regDate":"2022-12-04","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-04-1670135947112/568131_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-04-1670135947112"},{"id":"2022-12-04-1670132163357","title":"Pohang Canal (포항운하)","description":"Pohang Canal, completed in January 2014, cuts between Pohangs Songdo-dong and Jungdo 1-dong, connecting the waters under Dongbindaegyo Bridge with Hyeongsangang River to the south.
