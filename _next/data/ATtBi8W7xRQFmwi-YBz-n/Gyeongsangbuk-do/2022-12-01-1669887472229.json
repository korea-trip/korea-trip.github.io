The combination of an expansive sandy beach and indigo blue waters of the East Sea creates a splendid view, drawing a large number of vacationers in the summer. <br><br>Hupohang Port is the main receiving and distributing port for fish caught in the East Sea. In the early morning, the port offers a great chance to not only see fish being hauled from boats to the fish market, but also to purchase fresh raw fish at an affordable price. On the hill north of Hupo Beach stands Hupo Lighthouse where one can get an unobstructed view of the East Sea and the Uljin area. Hupo Beach is one of the few beaches offering a splendid view of both the port and the lighthouse.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-54-789-6851|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Film Locations:|Drama \"You and I (1997)\"|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Shower booths, campground|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-01-1669887472229/187426_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-01-1669887472229/187426_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-01-1669887472229/202363_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-01-1669887472229/202363_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-01-1669887472229/202371_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-01-1669887472229/202371_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-54-789-6851](tel:+82547896851)\n- [üè†www.uljin.go.kr](http://www.uljin.go.kr/tour/index.uljin)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.6750445745\nlongitude: 129.4420091571\ntitle: Samyul-ri, Uljin-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-01-1669887472229","title":"Hupo Beach (ÌõÑÌè¨Ìï¥ÏàòÏöïÏû•)","description":"The 250-meter-long Hupo Beach is situated right by Hupohang Port.

This type of technique is frequently found in those built during the Goryeo dynasty. The distinct features and carving methods that can be observed from this particular statue are speculated to be from the 11th century. Although there is a small amount of damage on the back of the head, the statue is well-preserved overall.","regDate":"2022-12-04","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-04-1670135947112/568131_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-04-1670135947112"},{"id":"2022-12-04-1670132163357","title":"Pohang Canal (Ìè¨Ìï≠Ïö¥Ìïò)","description":"Pohang Canal, completed in January 2014, cuts between Pohangs Songdo-dong and Jungdo 1-dong, connecting the waters under Dongbindaegyo Bridge with Hyeongsangang River to the south.
