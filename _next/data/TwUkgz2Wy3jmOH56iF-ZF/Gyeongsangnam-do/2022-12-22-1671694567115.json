The Mireukdo Special Tourist Zone, with the Donam Tourist Complex as its core, is well-equipped with a variety of leisure facilities, tourist accommodations and restaurants. This district caters to visitors with yacht services and a variety of water sports such as windsurfing, kayaking and water skiing. Exceptionally popular is the ferry cruise that takes visitors to Hansando Island, which is located just off the coast of Tongyeong, and to the other scenic islands such as Bijindo and Maemuldo. <br><br>Mireukdo Island is connected to Tongyeong through an undersea tunnel, Chungmu Bridge and Tongyeong Bridge, making it even more accessible to visitors.

However, they were damaged once again during the Korean War and were abandoned until the war ended where the temple was rejuvenated and made even bigger.
