One day, the maid took her husband’s boat out to sea to harvest seaweed. Her husband dropped her off at a site  that was at a distance from the beach. After promising to pick her up later, he returned to the beach to do his work. However, the weather turned bad as strong winds and pummeing waves begun. The husband failed to rescue his wife on time and she ultimately drowned. Since then, the villagers were unable to catch any fishes and some claimed that it wasbecause of the dead maid. To soothe the spirit of the dead maid, the villagers made several wooden carvings and held religious ceremonies. Later, fishes were gradually seen appearing and the villagers were able to fish and live comfortably again. Therefore, the place where the maid died was named Aebawi Rock and the building where the religious ceremony is held twice a year was named Haesindang. The ceremony is still honored today as a traditional folk event.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-33-572-4429|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|Every 18th of each month. <br>* If this date falls on a public holiday, it’s closed on the next working day instead.|\n|usetime:|March-October 09:00-18:00<br>November-February 09:00-17:00<br>* Last admission is one hour before closing.|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Admission Fees:|Adults: 3,000 won / Group: 2,000 won <br>Teenagers:  2,000 won / Group: 1,500 won<br>Children & Senior citizens: 1,500 won / Group: 1,000 won<br><br>* Senior citizens (ages 65 & older): Proof required|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-10-10-1665385902206/1425837_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-10-1665385902206/1425837_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-10-1665385902206/1425862_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-10-1665385902206/1425862_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-10-1665385902206/1425866_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-10-1665385902206/1425866_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-10-1665385902206/1425869_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-10-1665385902206/1425869_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-10-1665385902206/1425871_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-10-1665385902206/1425871_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-10-1665385902206/1425875_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-10-1665385902206/1425875_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-10-1665385902206/1425878_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-10-1665385902206/1425878_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-10-1665385902206/1425880_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-10-1665385902206/1425880_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-10-1665385902206/1425881_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-10-1665385902206/1425881_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-10-1665385902206/1425836_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-10-1665385902206/1425836_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-33-572-4429](tel:+82335724429)\n- [🏠www.samcheok.go.kr](http://www.samcheok.go.kr/tour.web)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.2680078425\nlongitude: 129.3273124779\ntitle: 1852-6, Samcheok-ro, Wondeok-eup, Samcheok-si, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Samcheok \nIntercity Bus Terminal, take Bus No. 24 to Haesindang Park Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-10-10-1665385902206","title":"Samcheok Haesindang Park (삼척 해신당공원)","description":"Haesindang Park is home to the the nation’s largest aquarium museum,&nbsp;which exhibits  folk materials that shows the  lifestyle of fishermen of the East Sea,  an arboretum and a park that displays&nbsp;some sexual art sculptures.

Originally established as Baegamseonwon Temple in 973, the temple changed its name several times, went through construction works, and has become the current Cheongpyeongsa Temple. Yi Ja-hyeon, a scholar of the Goryeo period, built a garden here by keeping its natural topography after he left his government post. In this area, there is a pond that was built during the Goryeo period and has preserved its original form. Many cultural heritages have disappeared over the years and during the Korean War as well. The remaining cultural heritages include Hoejeonmun Gate of Cheongpyeongsa Temple (Treasure No. 164), Three-story Stone Pagoda of Cheongpyeongsa Temple (Gangwon-do Cultural Heritage Material No. 8), and Stupa of Yi Ja-hyeon (posthumous epithet  Jillakgong). Cheongpyeongsa Temple’s Hoejeonmun Gate was built instead of Sacheonwangmun Gate (the gate of the Four Guardian Kings), in order to enlighten people about the transmigration of souls. Cheongpyeongsa Temple bears a myth about a princess and a serpent. The princess suffered a lot from a serpent as she couldn’t get rid of it from her body. Then she came to Cheongpyeongsa Temple and prayed to the Buddha, and she became free from the serpent. Therefore, the Three-story Stone Pagoda of Cheongpyeongsa Temple is also called “Princess Pagoda.” Although the scale of the temple is not large, it is known for beautiful natural landscape harmonized with artificial structures, such as a pavilion and a pond. Accordingly, the area of the temple was designated as Scenic Site No. 70. Cheongpyeongsa Temple can be also reached by taking a ferry at the Soyanggang Dam Quay.","regDate":"2022-10-22","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-22-1666424746299/1780622_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-22-1666424746299"},{"id":"2022-10-22-1666421910900","title":"Chuam Suspension Bridge (추암 출렁다리)","description":"Chuam Suspension Bridge is located near Chotdae Rock, famous as a sunrise spot.
