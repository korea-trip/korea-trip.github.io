Although the exact date of construction is uncertain, it is estimated that the building was built around the same time as Daejeonghyeon in 1416.<br>\n <br> The school was originally located inside Bukseong but it was once moved outside of Dongmun and then again to the site of Seoseong. It was finally moved to Dansan Oreum where it remains to this day. At present, Daejeonghyanggyo Confucian School  consists of Daeseongjeon, Myeongryundang, Dongjae, Seojae Shinsammun, Daeseongmun, Dongmalmun and Dongjeongmun. Daeseongjeon was remodeled in 1669, 1688, and 1752. Myeongryundang was rebuilt in 1772. After several instances of remodeling and rebuilding, Daeseongjeon was remodeled again in 1993. The Confucian school was designated as the Jeju Tangible Cultural Asset No. 4 in August 1971.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-64-742-8866|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-19-1658236093306/1617302_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658236093306/1617302_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658236093306/1617303_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658236093306/1617303_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658236093306/1617305_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658236093306/1617305_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658236093306/1617306_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658236093306/1617306_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658236093306/1617307_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658236093306/1617307_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658236093306/1617308_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658236093306/1617308_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658236093306/1617309_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658236093306/1617309_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-64-742-8866](tel:+82647428866)\n- [üè†www.visitjeju.net</a> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese, Malay) <br / ><br><a href=\"http://www.cha.go.kr/\" target=\"_blank\">www.cha.go.kr](http://www.visitjeju.net/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.2392193306\nlongitude: 126.2884466303\ntitle: 165-17, Hyanggyo-ro, Andeok-myeon, Seogwipo-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \nFrom Jeju International Airport Bus Stop, take Bus No. 152 to Sagye-ri Office Bus Stop and walk for approx. 1.6km.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-19-1658236093306","title":"Daejeonghyanggyo Confucian School (ÎåÄÏ†ïÌñ•Íµê)","description":"Daejeonghyanggyo was a Confucian school during Joseon Dynasty.

The tunnel has a spectacular and mystical beauty with countless stalactites and stalagmites, as well as stalactite columns. The particularly thin stalactites and stalactic columns in this cave are well-known for their uniqueness and beauty. Although this is a relatively small lava tunnel, its exotic colors and the richness of the secondary topological formations make it extraordinary in terms of research value.

Records show people have been living on the islands since as long as 1271, during the reign of Goryeo King Wonjong, at which point they were referred to as Hupungdo Islands, serving as a safe harbor for ships sailing between Jeju and the mainland. The name changed to Chujado Islands during the Joseon dynasty due to the lush forest of walnut trees, chuja in the Jeollanam-do dialect.

Legend has it that the pond was created by the water raining down off of a dragon that ascended to heaven.
