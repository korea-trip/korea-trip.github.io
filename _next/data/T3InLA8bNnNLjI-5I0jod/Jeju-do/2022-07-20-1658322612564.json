The tunnel has a spectacular and mystical beauty with countless stalactites and stalagmites, as well as stalactite columns. The particularly thin stalactites and stalactic columns in this cave are well-known for their uniqueness and beauty. Although this is a relatively small lava tunnel, its exotic colors and the richness of the secondary topological formations make it extraordinary in terms of research value.

Records show people have been living on the islands since as long as 1271, during the reign of Goryeo King Wonjong, at which point they were referred to as Hupungdo Islands, serving as a safe harbor for ships sailing between Jeju and the mainland. The name changed to Chujado Islands during the Joseon dynasty due to the lush forest of walnut trees, chuja in the Jeollanam-do dialect.

Legend has it that the pond was created by the water raining down off of a dragon that ascended to heaven.
