Cheongwansan Mountain is a rocky mountain with steep peaks. Red camellia flowers bloom in spring, while in fall, silver grass blankets the area, creating a spectacular scene. The mountain peak offers an incredible ocean view due to the mountains close location to the coast. To the south, the vast Dadohae Sea comes into view, and hikers may even get a glimpse of Hallasan Mountain from afar on a clear sunny day. A landscape of different mountain ridges can be seen to the north, namely Wolchulsan Mountain in Yeongam, Jeamsan Mountain in Jangheung, and Mudeungsan Mountain in Gwangju. <br><br> Cheongwansa Temple is located within a few hundred meters of the peak of the mountain. The recreational park is equipped with convenient facilities and a well-managed 7-kilometer-long hiking trail, serving as a great vacation spot for weekend getaways.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-61-867-6974|\n|opendate:|1995|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|Tuesdays|\n|usetime:|[Accommodations] Check in 15:00 / Check out 12:00 <br>[Park hours] 09:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals: Adults 1,000 won / Teenagers 600 won / Children 300 won<br>Groups: Adults 800 won / Teenagers 500 won / Children 200 won<br><br>[Accommodations]<BR>House of Forest: 40,000-154,000 won<BR>Yeonlip-dong: 40,000-94,000 won|\n|Available Facilities:|Accommodations, camping ground|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-15-1673768136110/2704939_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-15-1673768136110/2704939_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-15-1673768136110/2704940_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-15-1673768136110/2704940_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-15-1673768136110/2704941_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-15-1673768136110/2704941_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-15-1673768136110/2704943_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-15-1673768136110/2704943_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-15-1673768136110/2704945_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-15-1673768136110/2704945_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-15-1673768136110/2704946_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-15-1673768136110/2704946_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-61-867-6974](tel:+82618676974)\n- [🏠www.foresttrip.go.kr](https://www.foresttrip.go.kr/indvz/main.do?hmpgId=0196)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 34.5451339297\nlongitude: 126.8998851572\ntitle: 842-1150, Chilgwan-ro, Jangheung-gun, Jeollanam-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-15-1673768136110","title":"Cheongwansan National Recreational Forest (국립 천관산자연휴양림)","description":"Cheongwansan National Recreational Forest is located at the entrance of one of the five great mountains of the Jeolla region.

Thanks to these stately trees, in 2002 the Korea Forest Service selected the boulevard as one of the most beautiful roads in Korea.
