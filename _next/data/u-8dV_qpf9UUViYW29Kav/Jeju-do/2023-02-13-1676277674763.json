The road from Sanbanggulsa Temple in Southern Jeju to Songaksan Mountain is a famous coastal drive with breathtaking scenic views. Though not as enormous as Hallasan Mountain, the view from the peak of Songaksan is truly scenic. From the summit, one can see nearby islands such as Marado, Gapado, and Hyeongjeseom, and as far as Hallasan Mountain and the Pacific Ocean. <br><br> The main peak rises 104 meters above sea level. To the northwest of the main peak is an expansive prairie with several peaks. There is a crater about 500 meters in diameter and 80 meters in depth, with some blackish volcanic ash still remaining inside. Looking along the jagged coastline, one can spot the large man-made caves built during the Japanese occupation. The seashore at the base of Songaksan Mountain is a famous fishing ground and diverse fish such as sawedged perch and black porgy are caught here.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ Jeju Travel Hotline: +82-64-740-6000|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Songaksan Mountain Observatory|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-02-13-1676277674763/1620229_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-13-1676277674763/1620229_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-13-1676277674763/1620231_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-13-1676277674763/1620231_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-13-1676277674763/1620233_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-13-1676277674763/1620233_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-13-1676277674763/1999149_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-13-1676277674763/1999149_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-13-1676277674763/2653603_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-13-1676277674763/2653603_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-13-1676277674763/2653604_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-13-1676277674763/2653604_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-13-1676277674763/2653606_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-13-1676277674763/2653606_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-13-1676277674763/2653607_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-13-1676277674763/2653607_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-13-1676277674763/2653608_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-13-1676277674763/2653608_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-13-1676277674763/1620232_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-13-1676277674763/1620232_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-64-740-6000](tel:+82647406000)\n- [üè†www.visitjeju.net](http://www.visitjeju.net/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.1994515348\nlongitude: 126.2907750868\ntitle: Songakgwangwang-ro, Seogwipo-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Jeju International Airport, take Bus No. 100 to Jeju Bus Terminal. <br>\nFrom Jeju Bus Terminal, take a local bus bound for Pyeonghwa-ro to Moseul Bus Stop. <br>\nFrom Moseul Bus Stop, take a local bus bound for Sanisudong and get off at Songaksan Mountain.\n","data":{"id":"2023-02-13-1676277674763","title":"Songaksan Mountain (ÏÜ°ÏïÖÏÇ∞)","description":"Songaksan Mountain is also called 99 Bong (99 Peaks) due to its 99 small peaks.
