The temple is widely believed to have been first built during the Tamra dynasty (BC 476~AD 1005), which was prior to the Goryeo dynasty (AD 918~1392). However, there is no concrete evidence suggesting the exact year of construction or the temple‚Äôs original builder. In the early 1700s, when leaders of the Joseon dynasty proclaimed Confucianism as the national religion and executed a policy to destroy all the Buddhist temples in the Jeju area, where Gwaneumsa Temple was demolished. It was rebuilt in 1912 by a Buddhist nun, Anbongryeokwan, and renovated in 1964. <br><br>\n\nThe temple consists of the main shrine, Myeongbujeong Hall, a bell tower, Sanshingak Pavilion, and Bulimun Gate. There is also a Buddhist school run by the Gwaneumsa Temple located in downtown Jeju.<br><br>\n\nThere are many tourist spots near the temple such as a wooden seated Buddhist goddess statue that was designated a tangible cultural asset of Jeju-do in 1999. Other popular destinations include Jeju Natural Monument No. 50, a cherry blossom tree habitat, and the nearby ‚Äú4.3 Historic Site‚Äù commemorating the civil revolution many years ago on April 3rd.<br><br>\n\nAlso located close to the temple are the Mokseokwan Arboretum, Sancheondan, Halla Mountain, Uerimok Valley, Tamra Valley, and Gewaloreum Hill.
