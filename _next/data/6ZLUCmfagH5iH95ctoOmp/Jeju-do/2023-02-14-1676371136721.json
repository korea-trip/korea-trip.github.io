There are many legends surrounding the rock. One legend has it that a dragon stealing precious jade from Hallasan Mountain was shot down by an arrow from the mountain deity. When he fell down, his body immediately sank into the ocean and his head rapidly froze looking at the sky. Another legend has it that a white horse, who dreamed of being a dragon and ascending to the sky, came to be caught by a soldier and froze into the rock.<br><br>From Yongduam Rock, visitors can see haenyeo (female divers) working at catching seafood. Near the rock are various cafes, bars, and restaurants. The coastal road between here and Aewol-eup is popular among couples. Cafes and seafood restaurants began to appear there five years ago and now form a pleasant caf√© village.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ Jeju Travel Hotline: +82-64-740-6000|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Restaurants, gift shop, snack bar, restroom, drinking fountain, Tourist Information Center, etc.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Available in English, Japanese, Chinese |\n  \n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-64-740-6000](tel:+82647406000)\n- [üè†www.visitjeju.net](http://www.visitjeju.net/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.5158033889\nlongitude: 126.5119710049\ntitle: Yongduam-gil, Jeju-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Jeju International Airport, take a bus bound for Jeju-si Jungang-ro and get off at Yongdam Rotary.<br>\nWalk toward the beach for 5-10 minutes.<br><br>\n\n[Taxi]<br>\nApprox. 10 min from Jeju International Airport\n","data":{"id":"2023-02-14-1676371136721","title":"Yongduam Rock (Ïö©ÎëêÏïî)","description":"Situated on the northern coast in downtown Jeju, Yongduam Rock is an estimated 10-meter-tall stone that has been worn down over time by strong winds and waves into a shape resembling a dragons head.

With no entrance as such, the cave is not open to the general public and thus its original form remains preserved to this day, giving it a high geological value. <Br><Br> Although the Dangcheomuldonggul Cave is technically a lava tube, it resembles a limestone cave due to the secondary geological formations of lime substances that have accumulated in the ground above the tube. The tunnel has a spectacular and mystical beauty with countless stalactites and stalagmites, as well as stalactite columns. The particularly thin stalactites and stalactic columns in this cave are well-known for their uniqueness and beauty. Although this is a relatively small lava tunnel, its exotic colors and the richness of the secondary topological formations make it extraordinary in terms of research value. This cave has been designated natural monument.<Br><Br>* The UNESCO World Heritage inscribed Geomun Oreum Lava Tube System consists of Bengdwigul, Manjanggul Cave, Gimnyeonggul, Yongcheondonggul and Dangcheomuldonggul Caves.","regDate":"2023-02-15","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-15-1676450494241"},{"id":"2023-02-15-1676446569108","title":"Chujado Islands (Ï∂îÏûêÎèÑ)","description":"Located about 45 kilometers from Jeju Island and 35 kilometers from the Korean Peninsula, Chujado Islands is comprised of four inhabitated islands, called Sangchujado, Hachujado, Chupodo, and Hoenggando, as well as 38 uninhabited islands.

The name changed to Chujado Islands during the Joseon dynasty due to the lush forest of walnut trees, chuja in the Jeollanam-do dialect.
