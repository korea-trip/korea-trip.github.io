It was built under the leadership of Japanese General Kato Kiyomasa  in 1592-1593 at the beginning of the Imjinwaeran War (Japanese invasion, 1592-1598). The main fortress is located on a mountaintop 200 meters above sea level, a  second fortress is halfway down the mountain, and a  third fortress is located at the bottom of the mountain. The  whole fortress is rectangular shaped. The fortress wall is 6 meters high and slants at an angle of 15 degrees.<br> <br>In 1594, a Buddhist monk named&nbsp;Samyeong-daesa came to Seosaengpo Waeseong Fortress four times to negotiate for peace, but he failed each time. In 1598, the fortress was taken over by Korea with the assistance of General Magwi of the Ming dynasty. A year later, Changpyodang Shrine was built in honor of 53 Koreans who died during battles against the Japanese invading forces. However, the shrine was destroyed during the Japanese imperialism period and no trace of it remains. It is possible to tell from Seosaengpo Jinseongdo (a map drawn up in 1872) that the fortress was also partially used by  Korean forces.","regDate":"2022-08-19","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Ulsan","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Fortresses"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-19-1660914228428/217707_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Ulsan/2022-08-19-1660914228428"},{"id":"2022-08-19-1660908851329","title":"Seongnamsa Temple (ÏÑùÎÇ®ÏÇ¨ Ïö∏ÏÇ∞)","description":"The name of the temple is believed to have originated from the fact that it is located south of Gajisan Mountain or Seokansan Mountain.
