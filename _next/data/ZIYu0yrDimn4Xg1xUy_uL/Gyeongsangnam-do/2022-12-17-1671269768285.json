It was initially used by U.S. soldiers when a prisoner-of-war camp was established in Geoje in the aftermath of the Korean War. After the beach was opened to the public in the 1970s, it became better known for its natural beauty than its military history. The beach is relatively shallow with warm water and stretches 1.1 kilometers long and has a x_width of 30 meters. It has many nearby attractions such as Mangsan Mountain, Sujeongbong Peak, Anseom Island, and Yundolseom Island, creating a beautiful view.<br>Situated farther inland, partially encircled by the coastline, the water at Gujora Beach is calm and serene. A number of restaurants can be found nearby, mainly selling fresh <em>hoe</em> (sliced raw fish) as well as famous local produce such as anchovies and seaweed. Visitors can enjoy the nearby attractions such as Gujora Fortress as well as Haegeumgang, Naedo, and Oedo Islands by taking a cruise tour.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-55-639-4178|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Open 24 hr|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Shower booths, drinking fountain, camping site, etc.|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-17-1671269768285/583499_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-17-1671269768285/583499_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-17-1671269768285/583518_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-17-1671269768285/583518_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-17-1671269768285/747563_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-17-1671269768285/747563_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-17-1671269768285/747566_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-17-1671269768285/747566_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-55-639-4178](tel:+82556394178)\n- [üè†tour.geoje.go.kr](http://tour.geoje.go.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 34.8079772705\nlongitude: 128.6922330595\ntitle: 2056, Geoje-daero, Geoje-si, Gyeongsangnam-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-17-1671269768285","title":"Gujora Beach (Íµ¨Ï°∞ÎùºÌï¥ÏàòÏöïÏû•)","description":"Gujora Beach is not only known for its natural beauty and crystal clear water, but also as a beach that can be reached conveniently.

The footprints are deeply imprinted in the wide sheets of rocks arrayed along Dongdaeman Beach. Researchers believe that these enormous footprints belong to a species of huge pterosaur, and visitors can see about 60 smaller footprints that are believed to belong to early humans. The dinosaur footprints and other cretaceous fossils are located along the cape by the shore, so you must time your visit well to see them. According to paleontologists, the footprints are the evidence of three specimens of herbivorous  sauropoda, which walked on two 60 centimeter-long feet; two specimens of ornithopoda, which were also herbivores, that had three toes on each foot; and one specimen of another ornithopod species, a carnivore that had sharp claws and walked on two feet. The layout of the footprints alludes to a situation where the herbivores were walking in a group followed by a carnivore preparing for an attack! <br><br>","regDate":"2022-12-27","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Eco-Tourism Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-27-1672133762383/212944_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-27-1672133762383"},{"id":"2022-12-27-1672130246490","title":"DPIRANG (ÎîîÌîºÎûë)","description":"DPIRANG is a digital nighttime theme park in Nammangsan Park that consists of 15 walking paths decorated with lights.

On the hilltops, which were viewed as prime burial places, are the tombs of kings and rulers; on the slopes are the tombs of the lower classes. <br><br>A total of 136 tumuli were found in the Daesong-dong area. Further investigation of the tumuli revealed several important and interesting facts. First, from the end of the third century, men and horses were buried alive along with the dead. Also, weapons were bent and buried as well, with many of these artifacts being unearthed among the tumuli. Other materials found in the tumuli such as cylindrical bronze items, pinwheel-shaped bronze items, and jasper items showed that Gaya was involved in trade with Japan. The Daeseong-dong Tumuli is significant in that it gives a glimpse into the political and social structure of the Gaya Kingdom, and the cultural exchange between Korea, China, and Japan.","regDate":"2022-12-27","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-27-1672119336198"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
