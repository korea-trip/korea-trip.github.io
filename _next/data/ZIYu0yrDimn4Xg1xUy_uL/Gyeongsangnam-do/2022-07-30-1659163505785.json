{"pageProps":{"content":"![Baenaegol Valley (Î∞∞ÎÇ¥Í≥®)](/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228175_image2_1.webp)\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> Baenaegol Valley is located at the heart of the mountainous region affectionately known as the Yeongnam Alps. The valley derives its name ‚ÄúBaenaegol,‚Äù meaning ‚Äúthe valley of pears,‚Äù from the wild pear trees that grow in large numbers along the valley.<br><br>\n\nThe valley covers nearly 8 kilometers of land between the range connecting Sinbulsan Mountain and Yeongchuksan Mountain and the western range connecting Cheonhwangsan Mountain and Jaeyaksan Mountain in Miryang. It is a popular vacation destination in the summer. Also, many tourists come to drink the water containing acer mono sap, which is known to be produced in this region during the springtime.\n<br><br>\nBaenaegol Valley is just a short distance away from downtown Yangsan. The valley provides an opportunity to enjoy nature away from the hustle and bustle of the city center. The long valley is wedged between highlands, which results in at least two hours less of sunshine than other regions, so it feels cooler in the summer months. Strawberries are also widely grown in the area.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-55-382-4112|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228158_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228158_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228159_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228159_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228163_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228163_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228166_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228166_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228185_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228185_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228187_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228187_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-55-382-4112](tel:+82553824112)\n- [üè†www.yangsan.go.kr](http://www.yangsan.go.kr/tour)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.4564540524\nlongitude: 128.9660138589\ntitle: Wondong-myeon, Yangsan-si, Gyeongsangnam-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-30-1659163505785","title":"Baenaegol Valley (Î∞∞ÎÇ¥Í≥®)","description":"Baenaegol Valley is located at the heart of the mountainous region affectionately known as the Yeongnam Alps.

The footprints are deeply imprinted in the wide sheets of rocks arrayed along Dongdaeman Beach. Researchers believe that these enormous footprints belong to a species of huge pterosaur, and visitors can see about 60 smaller footprints that are believed to belong to early humans. The dinosaur footprints and other cretaceous fossils are located along the cape by the shore, so you must time your visit well to see them. According to paleontologists, the footprints are the evidence of three specimens of herbivorous  sauropoda, which walked on two 60 centimeter-long feet; two specimens of ornithopoda, which were also herbivores, that had three toes on each foot; and one specimen of another ornithopod species, a carnivore that had sharp claws and walked on two feet. The layout of the footprints alludes to a situation where the herbivores were walking in a group followed by a carnivore preparing for an attack! <br><br>","regDate":"2022-12-27","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Eco-Tourism Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-27-1672133762383/212944_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-27-1672133762383"},{"id":"2022-12-27-1672130246490","title":"DPIRANG (ÎîîÌîºÎûë)","description":"DPIRANG is a digital nighttime theme park in Nammangsan Park that consists of 15 walking paths decorated with lights.

On the hilltops, which were viewed as prime burial places, are the tombs of kings and rulers; on the slopes are the tombs of the lower classes. <br><br>A total of 136 tumuli were found in the Daesong-dong area. Further investigation of the tumuli revealed several important and interesting facts. First, from the end of the third century, men and horses were buried alive along with the dead. Also, weapons were bent and buried as well, with many of these artifacts being unearthed among the tumuli. Other materials found in the tumuli such as cylindrical bronze items, pinwheel-shaped bronze items, and jasper items showed that Gaya was involved in trade with Japan. The Daeseong-dong Tumuli is significant in that it gives a glimpse into the political and social structure of the Gaya Kingdom, and the cultural exchange between Korea, China, and Japan.","regDate":"2022-12-27","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-27-1672119336198"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
