Due to its tough topography, Hansingyegok Valley has been less visited and thus still has rather untouched forests. Only hikers with stamina can trail the course from Baengmu-dong to Hansingyegok Valley to Seseok. During the summer season, the valley area is an optimal vacationing spot due to its thick forests and cold, clear water. It‚Äôs a great spot for seeing the autumn foliage and for hiking in the winter snow.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-55-970-1000|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Parking Fees:|*Up to first 1 hr: <br>Compact cars 500 won / mid to small sized cars 1,100 won / large vehicles 2,000 won<br>*After exceeding 1 hr limit (for every additional 10 min.): <br>Compact cars 100 won / mid to small sized cars 250-300 won / large vehicles 400-500 won<br><br>[Fixed rate] <br>Compact cars 2,000 won <br>mid to small sized cars 4,000~5,000 won <br>large vehicles 6,000~7,500 won <br>* Regular shuttle buses are exception (monthly parking users are charged separately.)|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-19-1671428172263/1978664_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-19-1671428172263/1978664_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-19-1671428172263/1978666_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-19-1671428172263/1978666_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-19-1671428172263/1978669_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-19-1671428172263/1978669_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-19-1671428172263/1978671_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-19-1671428172263/1978671_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-55-970-1000](tel:+82559701000)\n- [üè†http://jiri.knps.or.kr ](http://jiri.knps.or.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.3643829052\nlongitude: 127.6805736086\ntitle: Gangcheong-gil, Macheon-myeon, Hamyang-gun, Gyeongsangnam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \nFrom Dong Seoul Bus Terminal, take a bus to Hamyang Bus Terminal.\nFrom Hamyang Bus Terminal Bus Stop, take a bus headed for Baengmu-dong.\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-19-1671428172263","title":"Hansingyegok Valley (Baengmudonggyegok Valley) (ÌïúÏã†Í≥ÑÍ≥°(Î∞±Î¨¥ÎèôÍ≥ÑÍ≥°))","description":"Located in Hamyang-gun, Gyeongnam, Hansingyegok Valley starts from Chotdaebong Peak and Yeongsinbong Peak of Jirisan Mountain, runs down to meet with Hansinjigyegok Valley at Ganesopokpo Falls and continues on to Baengmu-dong.

The footprints are deeply imprinted in the wide sheets of rocks arrayed along Dongdaeman Beach. Researchers believe that these enormous footprints belong to a species of huge pterosaur, and visitors can see about 60 smaller footprints that are believed to belong to early humans. The dinosaur footprints and other cretaceous fossils are located along the cape by the shore, so you must time your visit well to see them. According to paleontologists, the footprints are the evidence of three specimens of herbivorous  sauropoda, which walked on two 60 centimeter-long feet; two specimens of ornithopoda, which were also herbivores, that had three toes on each foot; and one specimen of another ornithopod species, a carnivore that had sharp claws and walked on two feet. The layout of the footprints alludes to a situation where the herbivores were walking in a group followed by a carnivore preparing for an attack! <br><br>","regDate":"2022-12-27","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Eco-Tourism Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-27-1672133762383/212944_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-27-1672133762383"},{"id":"2022-12-27-1672130246490","title":"DPIRANG (ÎîîÌîºÎûë)","description":"DPIRANG is a digital nighttime theme park in Nammangsan Park that consists of 15 walking paths decorated with lights.

On the hilltops, which were viewed as prime burial places, are the tombs of kings and rulers; on the slopes are the tombs of the lower classes. <br><br>A total of 136 tumuli were found in the Daesong-dong area. Further investigation of the tumuli revealed several important and interesting facts. First, from the end of the third century, men and horses were buried alive along with the dead. Also, weapons were bent and buried as well, with many of these artifacts being unearthed among the tumuli. Other materials found in the tumuli such as cylindrical bronze items, pinwheel-shaped bronze items, and jasper items showed that Gaya was involved in trade with Japan.
