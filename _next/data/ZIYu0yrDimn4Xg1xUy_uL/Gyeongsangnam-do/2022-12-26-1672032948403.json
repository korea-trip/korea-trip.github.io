It is the longest tourist cable car in Korea, stretching over a distance of 1,975 meters. Traveling at a speed of 4 meters per second, the cable car takes 9 minutes to travel from one station to the next. Despite the distance, there is only one midway support post, designed to create the lowest level of natural disturbance, as well as increase the view for passengers. There are 47 gondolas able to seat 8 passengers each, so there is very little wait time. Visitors traveling with pets can also bring their pets aboard, as the cable car has opened as a pet-friendly attraction.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-1544-3303|\n|parking:|Available (Small-sized car: 288 spaces / Large-sized car: 11 spaces)|\n|restdate:|2nd & 4th Monday of every month (closed the following day if Monday is a public holiday)|\n|usetime:|[October-March] 09:30-16:00<br>[April & September] 09:30-17:00<br>[May-August] 09:30-18:00 <br><br>* Schedule subject to change; inquire in advance.<br>* Ticketing may end 2-3 hours before closing time.|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Facility Utilization Fees:|[Individuals]<br>Adults: Round-trip 14,000 won / One-way 10,500 won<br>Children: Round-trip 10,000 won / One-way 8,000 won<br><br>[Groups]<br>Adults: Round-trip 13,000 won / One-way 10,000 won<br>Children: Round-trip 9,500 won / One-way 7,500 won<br><br>* Adults (ages 13 and older) / Children (ages 4-12)<br> * Group: 25 people or more|\n|Available Facilities:|Lower Station<br>- Station, rest area, observatory, fishery market, ticket booth, tourism information center, parking lot<br><br>Upper Station<br>- Station, rest area (snack bar), restroom, management office, observatory|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-26-1672032948403/1204865_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-26-1672032948403/1204865_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-26-1672032948403/1204868_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-26-1672032948403/1204868_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-26-1672032948403/1204869_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-26-1672032948403/1204869_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-26-1672032948403/1823752_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-26-1672032948403/1823752_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-1544-3303](tel:+8215443303)\n- [üè†cablecar.ttdc.kr](http://cablecar.ttdc.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 34.8266120596\nlongitude: 128.4250363662\ntitle: 205, Balgae-ro, Tongyeong-si, Gyeongsangnam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Seoul Express Bus Terminal or Seoul Nambu Terminal, take a bus to Tongyeong Intercity Bus Terminal.\n<br>\nFrom Tongyeong Intercity Bus Terminal Bus Stop, take Bus No. 141 and get off at Tongyeong Cable Car Ground Station Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-26-1672032948403","title":"Tongyeong Cable Car (ÌÜµÏòÅÏºÄÏù¥Î∏îÏπ¥)","description":"Tongyeong Cable Car is the only dual-cable automatic circulating gondola system in Korea, built with the most recent technology.

The footprints are deeply imprinted in the wide sheets of rocks arrayed along Dongdaeman Beach. Researchers believe that these enormous footprints belong to a species of huge pterosaur, and visitors can see about 60 smaller footprints that are believed to belong to early humans. The dinosaur footprints and other cretaceous fossils are located along the cape by the shore, so you must time your visit well to see them. According to paleontologists, the footprints are the evidence of three specimens of herbivorous  sauropoda, which walked on two 60 centimeter-long feet; two specimens of ornithopoda, which were also herbivores, that had three toes on each foot; and one specimen of another ornithopod species, a carnivore that had sharp claws and walked on two feet. The layout of the footprints alludes to a situation where the herbivores were walking in a group followed by a carnivore preparing for an attack! <br><br>","regDate":"2022-12-27","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Eco-Tourism Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-27-1672133762383/212944_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-27-1672133762383"},{"id":"2022-12-27-1672130246490","title":"DPIRANG (ÎîîÌîºÎûë)","description":"DPIRANG is a digital nighttime theme park in Nammangsan Park that consists of 15 walking paths decorated with lights.

The Daeseong-dong Tumuli are located in the center of the shell mounds of Hoehyeon-ri, the location of the founding of the Gaya Kingdom according to local legend.<br><br>The tumuli relics were excavated by researchers from the Kyungsung University Museum from 1990 to 1992 and were found to be the common burial ground of the dominant class of the Gaya Kingdom. On the hilltops, which were viewed as prime burial places, are the tombs of kings and rulers; on the slopes are the tombs of the lower classes. <br><br>A total of 136 tumuli were found in the Daesong-dong area. Further investigation of the tumuli revealed several important and interesting facts. First, from the end of the third century, men and horses were buried alive along with the dead. Also, weapons were bent and buried as well, with many of these artifacts being unearthed among the tumuli. Other materials found in the tumuli such as cylindrical bronze items, pinwheel-shaped bronze items, and jasper items showed that Gaya was involved in trade with Japan. The Daeseong-dong Tumuli is significant in that it gives a glimpse into the political and social structure of the Gaya Kingdom, and the cultural exchange between Korea, China, and Japan.","regDate":"2022-12-27","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-27-1672119336198"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
