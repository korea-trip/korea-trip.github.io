Not only is it popular as the largest summer vacation spot, but it also attracts people even in spring, autumn and winter for its variety of festivals and events, such as the Busan International Film Festival, the International Yacht Race and the Haeundae Sunrise Festival. These festivals help keep Haeundae busy as a popular tourist site all year round. <br><br>\nWith Haeundae Beach at its center, Haeundae Special Tourist Zone offers diverse marine leisure activities and fresh seafood. The zone has transformed itself from a typical vacation spot into a destination where one can stay long-term while enjoying leisure activities and cultural events. Today, the zone attracts an increasing number of tourists from around the globe. <br><br>\nThe zone not only has natural resources, such as Haeundae Beach, Dongbaekseom Island, Dalmaji Hill and sea water hot springs, but also a convention center and IT complex. Well-equipped with cultural facilities, including movie sets, art galleries and aquariums, it is a qualified destination for MICE (Meeting, Incentive tour, Convention and Exhibition) tourists. <br><br>\nThe coastal drive course is another way to enjoy Haeundae Beach.
