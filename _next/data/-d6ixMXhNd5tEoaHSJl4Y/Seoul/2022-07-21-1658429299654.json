In memory of these soldiers, Emperor Gojong built the Jangchungdan Shrine in November 1900 at the current site of the Shilla Hotel guesthouse. The shrine was lost during the Korean War and the area was renovated into a park in 1919.<br><br>On September 22, 1984, Jangchungdan Park was designated the 374th neighborhood park of Korea and part of the park was merged with Namsan Park. The remaining area retained the name “Jangchungdan Park” and is still home to cultural assets such as the Jangchungdan Memorial Stone, Supyogyo, Seungjeongjeon, Gwanseongmyo, and Waryongmyo. The park is considered a landmark of patriotism since it contains the 1919 Independence Movement of Korea Memorial Stone and other monuments dedicated to people such as Han Yong-un, Yu Gwan-sun, and Gim Yong-hwan who fought for the independence of Korea.","regDate":"2022-08-04","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-04-1659623660561/1945785_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-08-04-1659623660561"},{"id":"2022-08-04-1659621118461","title":"Jangchung-dong Jokbal Street (장충동 족발 골목)","description":"The phenomenon of Jangchungdong Jokbal Street started 50 years ago with the opening of two Korean jokbal (steamed pig trotters) restaurants, followed by the influx of new jokbal restaurants during the late 70s and early 80s. <br>Today, the jokbal restaurants continue to serve one of the most sought Korean food from the main road and the alleyways of the Jangchungdong 1(il)-ga Street area.","regDate":"2022-08-04","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Experience Programs","Cultural Districts"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-04-1659621118461/696569_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-08-04-1659621118461"},{"id":"2022-08-04-1659618367261","title":"Jamsil Special Tourist Zone (잠실 관광특구)","description":"Jamsil Special Tourist Zone includes Lotte World, Lotte World Tower, along with various amusement facilities, shopping malls, and historic sites in the nearby area.
