However, other documents seem to state that Neungin Daedeuk, a disciple of Monk Uisang, established the temple. During the Korean War, many documents related to the temple were destroyed, so much of the history has been lost. In 1972, while reconstruction work was being done on Geungnakjeon Hall, records were discovered stating the hall was repaired in 1363. This discovery gave concrete evidence that Geungnakjeon Hall is the oldest wooden building in the nation.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|expagerange:|Preschoolers accompanied by parent and older|\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-54-853-4181|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Not available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-29-1659084304406/2654213_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659084304406/2654213_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659084304406/2654214_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659084304406/2654214_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659084304406/2654215_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659084304406/2654215_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659084304406/2654217_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659084304406/2654217_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659084304406/2654218_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659084304406/2654218_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659084304406/2654219_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659084304406/2654219_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-54-853-4181](tel:+82548534181)\n- [üè†www.bongjeongsa.org</a><br><a href=\" https://www.templestay.com/temple_info.asp?t_id=bongjeongsa \" target=\"_blank\">www.templestay.com</a><br><a href=\"http://www.tourandong.com/public/sub1/sub1_3.cshtml?seq=1345&idx=2\" target=\"_blank\">www.tourandong.com](http://www.bongjeongsa.org/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.6555679404\nlongitude: 128.6596013369\ntitle: 222, Bongjeongsa-gil, Andong-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-29-1659084304406","title":"Bongjeongsa Temple [UNESCO World Heritage] (Î¥âÏ†ïÏÇ¨ [Ïú†ÎÑ§Ïä§ÏΩî ÏÑ∏Í≥ÑÎ¨∏ÌôîÏú†ÏÇ∞])","description":"Bongjeongsa Temple is believed to have been built in 672 by the Great Buddist Monk Uisang.
