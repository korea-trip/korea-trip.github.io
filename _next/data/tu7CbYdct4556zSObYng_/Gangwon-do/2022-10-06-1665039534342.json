The uppermost section, known as Gaetmaeul Beach, is 310 meters long and 69 meters wide and is ideal for a quiet and peaceful vacation. It is also a treasure trove of biodiversity and hosts interesting events that change every year. The second beach right below is Namae 3-ri Beach, a 504 meter-long, 77 meter-wide beach with shallow waters and fine sand and a host of accommodations and amenities serving tourists. The southernmost beach is Namae 1-ri Beach, a small beach that is 396 meters in length and 36 meters in x_width. It is a popular fishing site because of the large number of rocks along the shore, and its relative obscurity keeps the beach clean and tidy. The nearby Namaehang Port is said to be one of the “Three Beautiful Ports on the East Coast,” and a famous sunrise spot. Namaehang Skywalk and Undersea Experiential Learning Center can be found nearby as well.","regDate":"2022-10-06","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-06-1665046509526/2711369_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-06-1665046509526"},{"id":"2022-10-06-1665042428834","title":"Naksansa Temple (낙산사)","description":"This ancient temple was built in the 11th year of King Munmu’s reign of Silla (671) by the Buddhist monk Uisang. Naksansa Temple is one of the foremost sights of Yangyang, and one of the most historic sites in the region. Along with Ganghwa’s Bomunsa Temple and Namhae’s Boriam Hermitage, it is said to be one of the three centers of the cult of Avalokitesvara in Korea. Its handsome view overlooking the East Sea has earned it a spot in the Eight Sights of Gwandong (eight famous sights in Yeongdong region of Gangwon-do), documented throughout the ages in many classic literature and poetry. Today’s Naksansa Temple is a product of many restorations and expansions, and has many examples of cultural heritage within its walls. There is a 16 meter-tall statue of the Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva to Uisangdae, a pavilion built to overlook the sunrise over the East Sea on a coastal cliff, Hongnyeonam Hermitage, built over the crashing waves, Seven-story Stone Pagoda of Naksansa Temple, Yangyang (Treasure No. 499), a Joseon-era pagoda with Goryeo-era style, and Stupa, Stele, and Reliquaries of Naksansa Temple, Yangyang (Treasure No. 1723), including a number of sarira. A mountain fire in 2005 resulted in the loss of 20 buildings, including the building that housed its bronze bell (formerly Treasure No. 479 of Korea). The temple also operates templestay programs available through its website.","regDate":"2022-10-06","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-06-1665042428834/2711347_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-06-1665042428834"},{"id":"2022-10-06-1665036082838","title":"Naerincheon River Pothole-Gangwon Peace National Geopark (내린천 포트홀-강원평화지역 국가지질공원)","description":"Naerincheon River starts out as a small stream on Bungnyongsan Mountain and flows down Sogyebangsan Mountain before joining with other small valley streams to create the larger river that most people know. The river has created a valley with many interesting and uniquely shaped rocks as it flowed down the mountainside over the years. The waters are so pure, the small pebbles and sand lining the bottom of the stream can be seen clearly. There are a number of areas along the stream perfect for relaxing and enjoying some time in nature. Many families visit and enjoy fishing and the pure environment. The river is also well-known for rafting.","regDate":"2022-10-06","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Valleys"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-06-1665036082838/2616266_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-06-1665036082838","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Gangwon-do/2022-10-06-1665036082838"},{"id":"2022-10-06-1665033039678","title":"Mureunggyegok Valley (무릉계곡)","description":"Mureunggyegok Valley, between Dutasan Mountain and Cheongoksan Mountain, refers to a four-kilometer stretch from Hoamso Pond to Yongchupokpo Falls upstream. The waters of Mureunggyegok Valley flow over wide sheets of rock and into the cracks between them, forming large and particularly nice ponds along the path. Starting at Mureung Rock, a wide sheet of single rock on which hundreds can sit, the valley trail twists and turns as it passes Samhwasa Temple, Haksodae, Ongnyudong, and Seonnyeotang Ravine, all the way to Ssangpokpo and Yongchupokpo Falls, providing breathtaking scenery along the way. Also known as Arcadia, scholars and poets frequented the valley in times past, and the 5,000 square meters of Mureung Rock bears the inscribed names of some of these poets and their work. The valley offers a medley of curious-looking rocks and stones, and other odd scenery that attracts many tourists.","regDate":"2022-10-06","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Valleys"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-06-1665033039678/2660876_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-06-1665033039678","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Gangwon-do/2022-10-06-1665033039678"},{"id":"2022-10-06-1665030149840","title":"Mukhohang Port (묵호항)","description":"Situated in Donghae, Mukhohang Port opened in 1941 and used to be the most prolific trading port on the east coast. However, with the steady change in the economy, it has now become a center of fishing. A large wholesale seafood market at the port offers a wide array of freshly caught seafood. From early in the morning, merchants across the country gather at the market to purchase fresh seafood. Dried fish are also available.<br><br>Mukho Lighthouse, located atop Dongmunsan Mountain, opened in June 1963 as an unmanned lighthouse guiding ships into Mukhohang Port. The two-story lighthouse is 12 meters tall and is made from cement. The white lighthouse stands out against the blue sea and sky to create a fantastic image. The area surrounding the lighthouse has been turned into a small park.
