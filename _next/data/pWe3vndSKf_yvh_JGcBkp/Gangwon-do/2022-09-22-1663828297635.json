Walking up along the wooden deck trail among the bamboo grove leads you to the observatory, which offers an open view of the deep blue East Sea, the Cheongchoho Lake, which is home to migratory birds, and the magnificent scenery of Seoraksan Mountain. Viewed from the high tower, the East Sea unfolds its boundless ocean and sometimes it looks like a calm lake but can become an energetic ocean full of vitality. Built in 1957, Sokcho Lighthouse still lights up for ships at night. The bright light and sound of the beacon, which has been in service since the lighthouse’s establishment, can show the waterway to a boat, which is about 35 km away from the lighthouse. Right next to the observatory, Yeonggeumjeong Pavilion is situated.","regDate":"2022-10-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-13-1665647612612/2711170_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-13-1665647612612"},{"id":"2022-10-13-1665645019170","title":"Sokcho Expo Tower (속초 엑스포타워)","description":"Sokcho Expo Tower in the area of Cheongchoho Lake, Joyang-dong, is an observatory tower set in a park surrounded by mountains and lakes. <br><br>The tower is 73.4m in x_height and can accommodate up to 100 visitors at once.
