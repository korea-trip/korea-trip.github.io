It is here that Jeongseon Arirang, the No. 1 Intangible Cultural Asset of Gangwon-do, originated. The area has long been famous for its beautiful, clean mountains and rivers. Its name is derived from the Korean word <em>eoureojida,</em> meaning \"to meet\" as the waters of Pyeongchang and Samcheok unite in this area.<br>\n<br>Part of the upper stream of Namhangang River, Auraji was a famous starting point of log rafts transporting timber to Hanyang, the original name of Seoul. In the old days, one could always hear the singing of boatmen who came from all over the nation. The lyrics of Jeongseon Arirang reveal the sadness and longing of a woman awaiting her husband who left for business to a far-away place or left to transport timber.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(English, Korean, Japanese, Chinese)<br>• For more info: +82-1544-9053|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-24-1658635599656/1583475_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658635599656/1583475_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658635599656/175656_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658635599656/175656_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658635599656/179487_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658635599656/179487_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658635599656/179492_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658635599656/179492_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658635599656/2365263_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658635599656/2365263_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658635599656/2365265_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658635599656/2365265_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658635599656/2395942_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658635599656/2395942_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658635599656/2395943_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658635599656/2395943_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-1544-9053](tel:+8215449053)\n- [🏠www.ariaritour.com](http://www.ariaritour.com)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.4758305379\nlongitude: 128.7239879300\ntitle: 69, Auraji-gil, Jeongseon-gun, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Dong Seoul Bus Terminal, take a bus to Jeongseon Bus Terminal.<BR>From Jeongseon Bus Terminal Bus Stop, take a local bus bound for Yeoryang.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-24-1658635599656","title":"Auraji Lake (아우라지)","description":"Auraji is the name of a lake located in Yeoryang-myeon in Jeongseon-gun.

Viewed from the high tower, the East Sea unfolds its boundless ocean and sometimes it looks like a calm lake but can become an energetic ocean full of vitality. Built in 1957, Sokcho Lighthouse still lights up for ships at night. The bright light and sound of the beacon, which has been in service since the lighthouse’s establishment, can show the waterway to a boat, which is about 35 km away from the lighthouse. Right next to the observatory, Yeonggeumjeong Pavilion is situated.","regDate":"2022-10-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-13-1665647612612/2711170_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-13-1665647612612"},{"id":"2022-10-13-1665645019170","title":"Sokcho Expo Tower (속초 엑스포타워)","description":"Sokcho Expo Tower in the area of Cheongchoho Lake, Joyang-dong, is an observatory tower set in a park surrounded by mountains and lakes. <br><br>The tower is 73.4m in x_height and can accommodate up to 100 visitors at once.
