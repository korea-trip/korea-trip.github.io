The present temple is largely the result of reconstruction efforts completed in the 1970s. One of the most prized treasures at the temple is the Ijo-dongjong Bell, considered a major cultural asset. <br><br>Naejangsan Temple is a representative temple of Jeollabuk-do along with Geumsansa Temple on Moaksan Mountain.

The sprawling fields of reeds along the East Ridge are also a major draw, undulating like waves of gold in the crisp autumn wind. In particular, the east hiking path on Jangansan Mountain is lined with a wide field of silver grass making it popular among hikers.","regDate":"2023-01-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Nature","Natural Sites","County Parks"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-13-1673592009100"},{"id":"2023-01-13-1673588176159","title":"Jaman Mural Village (자만벽화마을)","description":"Jaman Mural Village is located in the ridge between Omokdae and Imokdae along the foot of Seungamsan Mountain’s Jungbawi Rock.
