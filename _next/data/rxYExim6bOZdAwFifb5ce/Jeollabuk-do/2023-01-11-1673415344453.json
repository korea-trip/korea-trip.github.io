The park has some noteworthy sightseeing attractions such as Wibongpokpo Falls, Wibongsa Temple, and Dongsang Reservoir. Winbongsanseong County Park was founded at the site of Winbongsanseong Fortress, which was built under King Sukjongs rule in 1675 as a refuge site to safekeep the portrait of Joeson dynastys founder King Taejo and the royal familys ancestral tablet in times of war or other national emergency. They are originally enshrined in Gyeonggijeon Shrine and Jogyeongmyo Shrine, and when Jeonju had fallen during the Donghak Peasant Revolution, the portrait and tablet were moved to a small palace inside the fortress. The original fortress walls were 16 kilometers in circumference with three gates in the north, east, and west, but only a half-moon shaped western gate remains standing today.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-63-240-4224|\n|restdate:|* Subject to closure during adverse weather conditions|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Natural Preservation Period (closed to public):|February 1 - May 15 / November 1 - December 15|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-11-1673415344453/1606413_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-11-1673415344453/1606413_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-11-1673415344453/1606414_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-11-1673415344453/1606414_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-11-1673415344453/1606415_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-11-1673415344453/1606415_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-11-1673415344453/1606416_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-11-1673415344453/1606416_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-11-1673415344453/1606417_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-11-1673415344453/1606417_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-63-240-4224](tel:+82632404224)\n- [üè†www.wanju.go.kr ](http://www.wanju.go.kr/tour/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.9051224481\nlongitude: 127.2528722878\ntitle: Daeheung-ri, Wanju-gun, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-11-1673415344453","title":"Wibongsanseong County Park (ÏúÑÎ¥âÏÇ∞ÏÑ±Íµ∞Î¶ΩÍ≥µÏõê)","description":"Wibongsanseong County Park is located north of Jeonju, past Songgwangsa Temple through a tunnel of cherry trees.

The present temple is largely the result of reconstruction efforts completed in the 1970s. One of the most prized treasures at the temple is the Ijo-dongjong Bell, considered a major cultural asset. <br><br>Naejangsan Temple is a representative temple of Jeollabuk-do along with Geumsansa Temple on Moaksan Mountain.
