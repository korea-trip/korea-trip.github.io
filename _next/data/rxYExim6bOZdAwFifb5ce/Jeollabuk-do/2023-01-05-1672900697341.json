The present temple is largely the result of reconstruction efforts completed in the 1970s. One of the most prized treasures at the temple is the Ijo-dongjong Bell, considered a major cultural asset. <br><br>Naejangsan Temple is a representative temple of Jeollabuk-do along with Geumsansa Temple on Moaksan Mountain.
