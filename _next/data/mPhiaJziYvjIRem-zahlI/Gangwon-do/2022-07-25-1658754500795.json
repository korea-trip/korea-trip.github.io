Chuncheon-style dakgalbi originates from the story in which people marinated chicken instead of pork and grilled it with charcoal like pork ribs in the 1960s. Later, various vegetables, such as cabbage and onion, were added to the dish and stir-fried together on an iron plate. As people can eat it plenty at a reasonable price, dakgalbi has been popular among college students and soldiers, and at this time, dakgalbi earned its nicknames such as ‚ÄúPeople‚Äôs galbi (ribs)‚Äù, and ‚ÄúCollege students‚Äô galbi.‚Äù The Dakgalbi Alley was established as dakgalbi restaurants were opened one by one on the backstreet of Myeongdong in Chuncheon, in the 1970s to 1980s. Currently, this 150 m-long alley is packed with dakgalbi restaurants on both sides. Along with charcoal-grilled spicy chicken and spicy griddled chicken, customers can try Chuncheon buckwheat noodles, which are also a famous local delicacy. The information panel explaining the history of Chuncheon spicy stir-fried chicken is installed in the alley.
