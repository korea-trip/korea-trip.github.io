However, it is now known that the temple was built after King Sukjong, the 19th King of the Joseon dynasty (1392-1910), who reigned from 1674 to 1720, because of the architectural style of Daeungjeon Hall. There is a legend that the Guryongsa Temple site was originally a lake where nine dragons lived. The name Guryong comes from the story that the lake was filled up to build the temple on it.
