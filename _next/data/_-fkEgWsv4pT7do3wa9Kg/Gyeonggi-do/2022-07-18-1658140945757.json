These rocks are basaltic, and are commonly called gombo (a face with chicken pox marks) rock because they are covered with small holes that form from air bubbles when volcanic lava cools rapidly. The surrounding scenery of the Hantangang River area is truly breathtaking and is also the site of a famous amusement park. The Hantangang River Resort, located in the lower region of the Hantangang River, stretches along 1.5 kilometers of the river's shore between the Saranggyo Bridge and the Hantangyo Bridge in Jeongok-ri, Yeoncheon-gun. The Hantangang River flows from the Pyeonggang River in North Korea and through through Cheorwon, Pocheon and Yeoncheon and eventually joins the Imjingang River. The river features many scenic points including a large valley with cliffs that consist of many rare rocks. The resort is a great place for rest and relaxation, and has facilities for the whole family, maintaining campsites for cars and motor homes, a dinosaur-themed Children’s Character Park, Children’s Transportation Land, a water park, an ecological pond, and a soccer field. Additionally, the Goseokjeong Pavilion and Sundam Valley are located nearby upstream.","regDate":"2022-09-15","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Tourist Complexes"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-15-1663223162380/2431947_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-09-15-1663223162380"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
