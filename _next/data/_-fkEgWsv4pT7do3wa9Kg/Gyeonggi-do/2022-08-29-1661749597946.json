{"pageProps":{"content":"![Jarasum Island (ÏûêÎùºÏÑ¨)](/2022-08-29-1661749597946/2482681_image2_1.webp)\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> Located in Gapyeong, Gyeonggi-do, Jarasum Island is an island formed on the Bukhangang River as a result of the construction of the Cheongpyeong Dam in 1943. The name &lsquo;Jarasum&rsquo; comes from the fact that it faces a hill that resembles a Jara (Korean word for soft-shelled turtle). Jarasum consists of four islands called Dongdo, Seodo, Jungdo, and Namdo, and has various leisure and park facilities. Visitors can find a car camping site and the filming location of the popular TV drama series 'Iris' on Seodo (west island), and an eco-cultural park with a grass plaza of over 100 meters in diameter on Jungdo (central island). There is also an ecosystem theme park called Ehwawon Garden at the westernmost tip of the Jarasum Campground. A popular camping spot, Jaraseom Island is also widely known as the venue of the annual Jarasum International Jazz Festival.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-31-580-4632|\n|parking:|Public parking lot available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Jaraseom Island camping site, Eco & Culture Park, 'Iris' filming location, ecosystem theme park (Ewhawon), etc.|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-29-1661749597946/2431922_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661749597946/2431922_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-29-1661749597946/2431928_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661749597946/2431928_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-29-1661749597946/2431929_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661749597946/2431929_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-29-1661749597946/2482665_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661749597946/2482665_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-29-1661749597946/2482668_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661749597946/2482668_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-29-1661749597946/2482669_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661749597946/2482669_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-29-1661749597946/2482671_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661749597946/2482671_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-29-1661749597946/2482677_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661749597946/2482677_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-29-1661749597946/2560407_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661749597946/2560407_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-29-1661749597946/2560394_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661749597946/2560394_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-31-580-4632](tel:+82315804632)\n- [üè†www.jarasum.net](http://www.jarasum.net)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.8208928790\nlongitude: 127.5210475885\ntitle: 60, Jaraseom-ro, Gapyeong-gun, Gyeonggi-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway]<br>\nFrom  Sangbong Station (Seoul Subway Line 7, Gyeongui-Jungang Line), transfer to Gyeongchun Line and get off at Gapyeong Station. <BR>\nWalk for approx. 15 min.<BR>\n<br>\n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Sangbong Bus Terminal or Dong Seoul Bus Terminal, take an intercity bus to Gapyeong Bus Terminal.<br>\nWalk for approx. 15 min.\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-29-1661749597946","title":"Jarasum Island (ÏûêÎùºÏÑ¨)","description":"Located in Gapyeong, Gyeonggi-do, Jarasum Island is an island formed on the Bukhangang River as a result of the construction of the Cheongpyeong Dam in 1943.

These rocks are basaltic, and are commonly called gombo (a face with chicken pox marks) rock because they are covered with small holes that form from air bubbles when volcanic lava cools rapidly. The surrounding scenery of the Hantangang River area is truly breathtaking and is also the site of a famous amusement park. The Hantangang River Resort, located in the lower region of the Hantangang River, stretches along 1.5 kilometers of the river's shore between the Saranggyo Bridge and the Hantangyo Bridge in Jeongok-ri, Yeoncheon-gun. The Hantangang River flows from the Pyeonggang River in North Korea and through through Cheorwon, Pocheon and Yeoncheon and eventually joins the Imjingang River. The river features many scenic points including a large valley with cliffs that consist of many rare rocks. The resort is a great place for rest and relaxation, and has facilities for the whole family, maintaining campsites for cars and motor homes, a dinosaur-themed Children‚Äôs Character Park, Children‚Äôs Transportation Land, a water park, an ecological pond, and a soccer field. Additionally, the Goseokjeong Pavilion and Sundam Valley are located nearby upstream.","regDate":"2022-09-15","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Tourist Complexes"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-15-1663223162380/2431947_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-09-15-1663223162380"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
