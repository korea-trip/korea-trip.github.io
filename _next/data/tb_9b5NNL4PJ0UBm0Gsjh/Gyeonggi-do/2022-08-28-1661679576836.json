Janganmun Gate served as the main gate because the king would pass from this gate when arriving from Hanyang, the capital city, now modern-day Seoul. It is interesting to note that this gate is larger than Sungryemun Gate in Seoul.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-031-228-4416|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|March-October 09:00-18:00<br>November-February 09:00-17:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|[Suwon Hawseong Fortress]<br>Adults: Individuals 1,000 won / Groups 700 won<br>Teenagers: Individuals 700 won / Groups 500 won<br>Children: Individuals 500 won / Groups 300 won<br><br>[Hwaseong Haenggung Palace] <br>Adults: Individuals 1,500 won / Groups 1,200 won<br>Teenagers: Individuals 1,000 won / Groups 800 won<br>Children: Individuals 700 won / Groups 500 won<br><br>* Groups: 20 persons or more|\n|Parking Fees:|Small/Mid-sized car 2,000 won for 3 hours / 10,000 won for one-day<br>Large-sized car 4,000 won for 3 hours / 15,000 won for one-day<br>* 200 won for each additional 10 minutes after 3 hours|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|English, Japanese|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-28-1661679576836/734408_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-28-1661679576836/734408_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-28-1661679576836/734409_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-28-1661679576836/734409_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-28-1661679576836/734411_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-28-1661679576836/734411_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-28-1661679576836/734412_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-28-1661679576836/734412_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-28-1661679576836/1092241_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-28-1661679576836/1092241_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-28-1661679576836/2514364_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-28-1661679576836/2514364_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-28-1661679576836/2514365_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-28-1661679576836/2514365_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-28-1661679576836/2514366_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-28-1661679576836/2514366_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-28-1661679576836/2514367_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-28-1661679576836/2514367_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-031-228-4416](tel:+820312284416)\n- [üè†suwon.go.kr</a> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br><a href=\"http://www.swcf.or.kr/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"web\">www.swcf.or.kr](http://www.suwon.go.kr/web/visitsuwon/index.do)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.2888704361\nlongitude: 127.0142422513\ntitle: 910, Jeongjo-ro, Paldal-gu, Suwon-si, Gyeonggi-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nSuwon Station (Seoul Subway Line 1), Underground Shopping Mall Exit 3.
