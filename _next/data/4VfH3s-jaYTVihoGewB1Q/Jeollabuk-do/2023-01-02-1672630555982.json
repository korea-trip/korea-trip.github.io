The temple is widely believed to have been established by the great monk Uisang Daesa during the 16th year of King Munmu (676). However, some experts site the existence of the Namgeunseok stone animal sculpture as proof that the temple was originally the private temple of King Beop of the Baekje Kingdom. <br><br>Throughout history, the temple has had many names—Guksinsa, Gwisinsa, Gusunsa, and Gwisinsa (same English spelling, different meaning)—but not much is known about when the temple was called by which name. On the temple grounds are a 3-story stone pagoda and some stone sculptures including seoksu (animal statues) and budo (a stupa in honor of a great master). Inside the temple are Daejeokgwangjeon Hall (Treasure No.826), Myeongbujeon Hall, and Gongyangjib Chamber (a chamber for Buddhist offerings).\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-63-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-63-548-0917|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Not available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-02-1672630555982/176743_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-02-1672630555982/176743_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-02-1672630555982/176744_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-02-1672630555982/176744_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-02-1672630555982/612500_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-02-1672630555982/612500_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-02-1672630555982/196929_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-02-1672630555982/196929_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-63-548-0917](tel:+82635480917)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.7453148338\nlongitude: 127.0470225669\ntitle: 40, Cheongdo 6-gil, Gimje-si, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>\nFrom Jeonju Intercity/Express Bus Terminal, take Bus No. 79 and get off at Cheongdo-ri Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-02-1672630555982","title":"Gwisinsa Temple - Gimje (귀신사 - 김제)","description":"Gwisinsa, located in Cheongdo Village, Geumsan-myeon, Gimje-si, is now a temple of the Jogye Order, but once belonged to the Haweom Order.
