The park is one of the largest film and television studio sets in Korea.<br><br>The theme park is located in Gahori, Yongju-myeon (Hapcheon) and covers an area of over 231,406.00„é°.

However, they were damaged once again during the Korean War and were abandoned until the war ended where the temple was rejuvenated and made even bigger. Located nearby are Geoyeonjeong and Gunjajeong Halls that are believed to have been the studying venue of scholars. <br><br> * Daewonsa Valley<br> The two-kilometer-long valley that stretches from the parking lot at the entrance to Daewon Temple to the temple itself is surrounded by high hills and curious-looking rocks. The clean water that oozes out through craters between the rocks generates unusual scenery.

Somakgol Valley is known to be the place where the last king of Garak Kingdom came to feed his cows and horses.","regDate":"2022-12-24","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-24-1671863872959/793142_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-24-1671863872959"},{"id":"2022-12-24-1671860171377","title":"Pyeongsari Park (ÌèâÏÇ¨Î¶¨Í≥µÏõê)","description":"Situated along Seomjingang River between Gurye and Hadong, Pyeongsari Park was built for the enjoyment of summer tourists to the area.
