The island boasts fertile soil, abundant schools of fish, and scenic sights; local heritages (female divers, stone walls, and stone tombs) as well as natural attractions abound on the island, making it a miniature of Jeju Island. The island is also full of amenities and tourism outlets  fishing, bike trails, sand massages, submarine tours and cruises. At the highest point of the island, Udobong Peak (alt. 132 meters), visitors can see a panoramic view of the island as well as Seongsan Ilchulbong Tuff Cone and the main island. Rhodolith Beach (a white beach designated Natural Monument) has appeared regularly in films and TV commercials thanks to its breathtaking white sand and emerald sea.
