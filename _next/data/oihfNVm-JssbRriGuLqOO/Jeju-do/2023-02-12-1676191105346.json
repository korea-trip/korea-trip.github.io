Cultural properties in the folk village have been handed down from generation to generation and include treasures such as residential houses, Confucian shrines and schools, ancient government offices, stone statues, large millstones (pulled by horses or ox), fortress ruins, and stone monuments. Among the cultural gems of the folk village are intangible cultural assets such as folk plays, native foods, local folk craftsmanship, and local dialect.

Several zelkova and nettle trees that are hundreds of years old stand at the center of the village, preserving the dignified atmosphere of a bygone era. <br><br> The Seongeup Folk Village shows the unique culture of Jeju Island. The local tongsi (traditional Jeju restroom) are especially well-known characteristics of Jeju folk culture.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-64-710-6797|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Tour Course Information:|South Gate → Yeonjamae (ox-pulled millstone) & Gopyeongo’s old house → Gosangeun’s old house → Bangjuk → Jeongeuihyeon → zelkova tree & hackberry tree → lgwanheon (ancient administration building) → Leeyeongsuk’s old house → Jeongui Hyanggyo→ Hanbongil’s old house → South Gate|\n|Available Facilities:|Accomodation, restaurants etc.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-02-12-1676191105346/898566_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-12-1676191105346/898566_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-12-1676191105346/898575_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-12-1676191105346/898575_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-12-1676191105346/2364389_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-12-1676191105346/2364389_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-12-1676191105346/2364393_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-12-1676191105346/2364393_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-12-1676191105346/2455556_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-12-1676191105346/2455556_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-12-1676191105346/2455561_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-12-1676191105346/2455561_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-12-1676191105346/2455562_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-12-1676191105346/2455562_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-12-1676191105346/2455564_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-12-1676191105346/2455564_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-12-1676191105346/2455570_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-12-1676191105346/2455570_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-12-1676191105346/898556_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-12-1676191105346/898556_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-64-710-6797](tel:+82647106797)\n- [🏠www.visitjeju.net](http://www.visitjeju.net/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.3845391870\nlongitude: 126.8003906281\ntitle: 19, Seongeupjeonguihyeon-ro, Seogwipo-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Jeju Intercity Bus Terminal take an Intercity Bus to Beonnyeong-ro.<br>\nGet off at Seongeup 1(il)-ri Office Bus Stop. <br>\nGo around the corner and walk along the road for about 200m.\n","data":{"id":"2023-02-12-1676191105346","title":"Seongeup Folk Village (성읍민속마을)","description":"Located at the foot of Halla Mountain on Jeju Island, Seongeup Folk Village is a small town that holds a vast amount of culture over a wide period of time from 1410 to 1914.

The island boasts fertile soil, abundant schools of fish, and scenic sights; local heritages (female divers, stone walls, and stone tombs) as well as natural attractions abound on the island, making it a miniature of Jeju Island. The island is also full of amenities and tourism outlets  fishing, bike trails, sand massages, submarine tours and cruises.
