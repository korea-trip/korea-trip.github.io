The length of the island is 3.8 kilometers and the circumference is 17 kilometers. People have lived in Udo Island since the Joseon period, with most living as a farmer or working in the fishing industry. The island boasts fertile soil, abundant schools of fish, and scenic sights; local heritages (female divers, stone walls, and stone tombs) as well as natural attractions abound on the island, making it a miniature of Jeju Island. The island is also full of amenities and tourism outlets  fishing, bike trails, sand massages, submarine tours and cruises. At the highest point of the island, Udobong Peak (alt. 132 meters), visitors can see a panoramic view of the island as well as Seongsan Ilchulbong Tuff Cone and the main island. Rhodolith Beach (a white beach designated Natural Monument) has appeared regularly in films and TV commercials thanks to its breathtaking white sand and emerald sea. The sea around the beach showcases different colors depending on the water level. This makes Rhodolith Beach one of the most popular tourist attractions in Jeju-do, along with Hallasan Mountain. To protect the exquisite nature and promote maritime tourism, Bukjeju County designated two ports on the island (Udo Port and Haumokdong Port) and the sea surrounding it (25,863 ㎢) as Udo Maritime Park in January 2001. Visitors can appreciate maritime tourism at its best including a trip under the sea by submarine.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br> • Jeju Travel Hotline: +82-64-740-6000|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Film Locations:|Movie \"Little Mermaid (2004)\"|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-02-14-1676349661718/2364394_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-14-1676349661718/2364394_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-14-1676349661718/2364395_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-14-1676349661718/2364395_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-14-1676349661718/2364397_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-14-1676349661718/2364397_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-14-1676349661718/2364398_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-14-1676349661718/2364398_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-14-1676349661718/2364399_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-14-1676349661718/2364399_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-14-1676349661718/2654835_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-14-1676349661718/2654835_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-64-740-6000](tel:+82647406000)\n- [🏠https://www.visitjeju.net/kr/detail/view?contentsid=CONT_000000000500477\"title=\"새창: 비짓제주\"target=\"_blank\"><br>www.visitjeju.net](<br>https://www.visitjeju.net/kr/detail/view?contentsid=CONT_000000000500477)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.5065059625\nlongitude: 126.9533995648\ntitle: 153, Udo-ro, Jeju-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2023-02-14-1676349661718","title":"Udo Island - Udo Maritime Park (우도(해양도립공원))","description":"Situated 3.8 kilometers off the northeast coast of Jeju Island, Udo Island was named because it resembles a lying cow.

The cave measures approximately 400 meters in length, 6 meters in x_width, and 3 meters in x_height. It is thought to have been created by lava that erupted from Hallasan Mountain some 25 million years ago. <br><br>One of the unique features of this particular cave is that it has features of both a lava tube and a limestone cave. The entire area surrounding the cave is a huge stratum of seashells and sand, while the interior is a mystical mix of stalactites and stalagmites. Lime covers the cave walls in a series of natural swirls and streaks, bringing to mind the strokes of an abstract painting. Since the cave stays at a constant 17-18℃ throughout the year, it’s a welcome escape from the heat in the summer and a great place to warm up in the winter. <br><br>The cave gets its name from its two branches, which are said to look like the paths of two dragons (‘Ssangyong’ meaning ‘two dragons’ in Korean). It is thought that Ssangyonggul Cave and Hyeopjaegul Cave were once one cave since the second entrance of Ssangyonggul Cave is so close to the end of Hyeopjaegul Cave.","regDate":"2023-02-18","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-18-1676712970362/218751_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-18-1676712970362"},{"id":"2023-02-18-1676709536401","title":"Snoopy Garden (스누피가든)","description":"Snoopy Garden House is where visitors can meet Snoopy and friends from the popular American comic series Peanuts.

Each hole is separated from the other holes by a few meters.<br><br> Legend has it that Samseonghyeol is the place where three demigods, the founding fathers of Tamna (the former name of Jeju), first appeared. They lived by hunting and gathering until&nbsp;they married three princesses from Byeokrangguk, whom came to shore in a wooden box. The three princesses brought with them a calf, pony, and five different seeds that eventually helped to establish agriculture in Jeju.<br><br> Curiously, the three holes are not percolated by rain or snow.  The ancient trees surrounding the holes look as if they are bowing to them, often surprising visitors.
