The cave measures approximately 400 meters in length, 6 meters in x_width, and 3 meters in x_height. It is thought to have been created by lava that erupted from Hallasan Mountain some 25 million years ago. <br><br>One of the unique features of this particular cave is that it has features of both a lava tube and a limestone cave. The entire area surrounding the cave is a huge stratum of seashells and sand, while the interior is a mystical mix of stalactites and stalagmites. Lime covers the cave walls in a series of natural swirls and streaks, bringing to mind the strokes of an abstract painting. Since the cave stays at a constant 17-18℃ throughout the year, it’s a welcome escape from the heat in the summer and a great place to warm up in the winter. <br><br>The cave gets its name from its two branches, which are said to look like the paths of two dragons (‘Ssangyong’ meaning ‘two dragons’ in Korean). It is thought that Ssangyonggul Cave and Hyeopjaegul Cave were once one cave since the second entrance of Ssangyonggul Cave is so close to the end of Hyeopjaegul Cave.","regDate":"2023-02-18","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-18-1676712970362/218751_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-18-1676712970362"},{"id":"2023-02-18-1676709536401","title":"Snoopy Garden (스누피가든)","description":"Snoopy Garden House is where visitors can meet Snoopy and friends from the popular American comic series Peanuts.

The word “Samseonghyeol” means “three clans holes”, referring to the three 品 shaped holes in the middle of the forest. Each hole is separated from the other holes by a few meters.<br><br> Legend has it that Samseonghyeol is the place where three demigods, the founding fathers of Tamna (the former name of Jeju), first appeared. They lived by hunting and gathering until&nbsp;they married three princesses from Byeokrangguk, whom came to shore in a wooden box. The three princesses brought with them a calf, pony, and five different seeds that eventually helped to establish agriculture in Jeju.<br><br> Curiously, the three holes are not percolated by rain or snow.  The ancient trees surrounding the holes look as if they are bowing to them, often surprising visitors.
