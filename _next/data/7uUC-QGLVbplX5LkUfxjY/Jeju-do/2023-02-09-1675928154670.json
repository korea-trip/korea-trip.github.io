The original buildings of the government complex were all burned to the ground in 1434 and rebuilt shortly afterward, with continual work done throughout the Joseon period. However, it was systemically destroyed during the Japanese colonial period (1910-1945) with the exception of Gwandeokjeong Pavilion, which remained intact. The current Jeju-mok Government Office was restored in December 2002 following four extensive excavation projects from 1991 to 1998, which were performed to to find its structures as well as locations of buildings, based on expert opinions as well as old documents.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-64-710-6714|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 1,500 won / Teenagers 800 won / Children 400 won<br />Groups - Adults 1,000 won / Teenagers 600 won / Children 300 won<br /><br>* Groups: 10 people or more<br />* Free admission: Preschoolers (ages 6 and younger), senior citizens (ages 65 and older)|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-02-09-1675928154670/2517308_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-09-1675928154670/2517308_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-09-1675928154670/2517372_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-09-1675928154670/2517372_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-09-1675928154670/2517377_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-09-1675928154670/2517377_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-09-1675928154670/2517378_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-09-1675928154670/2517378_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-09-1675928154670/2517380_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-09-1675928154670/2517380_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-09-1675928154670/2517381_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-09-1675928154670/2517381_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-09-1675928154670/2517382_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-09-1675928154670/2517382_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-09-1675928154670/2517385_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-09-1675928154670/2517385_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-09-1675928154670/2517391_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-09-1675928154670/2517391_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-09-1675928154670/2517304_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-09-1675928154670/2517304_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-64-710-6714](tel:+82647106714)\n- [üè†www.cha.go.kr](http://www.cha.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.5137037819\nlongitude: 126.5220646195\ntitle: 25, Gwandeok-ro, Jeju-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nTake Bus No. 100, 200, or 300 and get off at Gwandeokjeong Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2023-02-09-1675928154670","title":"Jeju-mok Government Office (Ï†úÏ£ºÎ™©Í¥ÄÏïÑ)","description":"Jeju-mok Government Office is the former central government office where the magistrate of Jeju presided over political and administrative affairs from the Tamna period until the Joseon dynasty.

It is thought to have been created by lava that erupted from Hallasan Mountain some 25 million years ago. <br><br>One of the unique features of this particular cave is that it has features of both a lava tube and a limestone cave. The entire area surrounding the cave is a huge stratum of seashells and sand, while the interior is a mystical mix of stalactites and stalagmites. Lime covers the cave walls in a series of natural swirls and streaks, bringing to mind the strokes of an abstract painting. Since the cave stays at a constant 17-18‚ÑÉ throughout the year, it‚Äôs a welcome escape from the heat in the summer and a great place to warm up in the winter. <br><br>The cave gets its name from its two branches, which are said to look like the paths of two dragons (‚ÄòSsangyong‚Äô meaning ‚Äòtwo dragons‚Äô in Korean). It is thought that Ssangyonggul Cave and Hyeopjaegul Cave were once one cave since the second entrance of Ssangyonggul Cave is so close to the end of Hyeopjaegul Cave.","regDate":"2023-02-18","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-18-1676712970362/218751_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-18-1676712970362"},{"id":"2023-02-18-1676709536401","title":"Snoopy Garden (Ïä§ÎàÑÌîºÍ∞ÄÎì†)","description":"Snoopy Garden House is where visitors can meet Snoopy and friends from the popular American comic series Peanuts.

They lived by hunting and gathering until&nbsp;they married three princesses from Byeokrangguk, whom came to shore in a wooden box. The three princesses brought with them a calf, pony, and five different seeds that eventually helped to establish agriculture in Jeju.<br><br> Curiously, the three holes are not percolated by rain or snow.
