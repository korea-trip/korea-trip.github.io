What started over 30 years ago as a private garden has expanded to cover the entire island in a plethora of plants in European-style gardens, accented by scultures and statues. The garden blooms in a riot of flowers in April, and visitors can walk in the cool shade of the forested trails in summer. Recently, dinosaur footprints were found on the island, adding to its value. The islands cafe offers drinks and light snacks, along with a fantastic view of Haegeumgang Island and the surrounding blue sea. Oedo-Botania is only accessable via a ferry tour, and there are no accommodations on the island.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-55-681-4541|\n|parking:|Available at ferry dock|\n|restdate:|Refer to the official website|\n|usetime:|Winter 08:30-17:00<br />Summer 08:00-19:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 11,000 won / Teenagers 8,000 won / Children 5,000 won<br>Groups - Teenagers 6,000 won / Children 4,000 won|\n|Available Facilities:|Themed gardens, observatory, rest area, walking paths, gift shop, etc.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-24-1671852964600/1784631_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-24-1671852964600/1784631_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-24-1671852964600/2612894_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-24-1671852964600/2612894_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-24-1671852964600/2612895_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-24-1671852964600/2612895_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-24-1671852964600/2612896_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-24-1671852964600/2612896_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-24-1671852964600/2612897_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-24-1671852964600/2612897_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-24-1671852964600/2612898_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-24-1671852964600/2612898_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-24-1671852964600/2612899_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-24-1671852964600/2612899_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-55-681-4541](tel:+82556814541)\n- [üè†www.oedobotania.com](http://www.oedobotania.com/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 34.7694763580\nlongitude: 128.7113935264\ntitle: 17, Oedo-gil, Geoje-si, Gyeongsangnam-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-24-1671852964600","title":"Oedo-Botania (Ïô∏ÎèÑ Î≥¥ÌÉÄÎãàÏïÑ)","description":"Oedo-Botania is a marine botanical garden located on an island in Hallyeohaesang National Park between Tongyeong and Geojedo Island.

It was named so because the leaves turn so crimson that the water of the valley reflects the color and appears crimson as well. This is the place where Chi-Won Choe, after returning from Dang China to Silla (BC 57-AD 935) found Korea in disarray. It was too much to bear for him so he retired to live privately with poetry until his death. <br><br>There are 19 famous places in Hongryudonggyegok Valley, including major cultural assets like Jongsangjeong Pavilion, Nakhwadam, and Bunokpok. The scenery of Nongsanjeong Pavilion, where Chi-Won Choe read poetry and played baduk, is especially beautiful.  On the opposite side is a rock where you can see the handwring of Chi-Won Choe. The Yongmunpokpo Falls, located on the north end of the valley, has beautiful scenery with its harmonious blend of falling water and Giamgoiseok (fantastic rocks and stones).  <br><br>The scenery of Hongryudonggyegok Valley changes every season, and it is the finest part of Gayasan Mountain. It is famous for the azaleas in full bloom during the spring, and for the thousand-year-old pine trees and broad-leaved trees growing thickly throughout the valley and the cool, clear water that runs through it during the summer. In the fall, the nearby pine tree forests and broad-leaved trees tinge in color and accentuate the crimson foliage of autumnal leaves, making the crimson reflection of the leaves in the valley water look like a rising flame, and shows why the valley was named Hongryudonggyegok Valley.","regDate":"2022-12-28","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Valleys"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-28-1672212935139/2625847_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-28-1672212935139"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
