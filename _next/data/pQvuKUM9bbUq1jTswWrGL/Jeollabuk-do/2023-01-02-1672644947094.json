In 1404, a civil official from the Joseon dynasty built this structure as a country house.  Hanbyeokdang was built at the foot of Seungamsan Mountain with beautiful views of the Jeonjucheon River below.  A large highway has since been built nearby taking away from the natural beauty.  In the past, many writers often sought out Hanbyeokdang Pavilion to find inspiration in their writing.  The pavilion is well known for the beauty of the mountain mist flowing down the mountain, thus making it one of the 8 must sees in Jeonju.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info:+82-63-281-2166|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|24 hrs|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-02-1672644947094/167360_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-02-1672644947094/167360_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-02-1672644947094/2515271_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-02-1672644947094/2515271_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-02-1672644947094/2515272_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-02-1672644947094/2515272_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-02-1672644947094/2515273_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-02-1672644947094/2515273_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-02-1672644947094/2515275_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-02-1672644947094/2515275_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-02-1672644947094/2515300_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-02-1672644947094/2515300_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-02-1672644947094/2515301_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-02-1672644947094/2515301_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-02-1672644947094/2515302_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-02-1672644947094/2515302_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-02-1672644947094/2515450_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-02-1672644947094/2515450_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-63-281-2166](tel:+82632812166)\n- [üè†tour.jeonju.go.kr</a> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br><a href=\"http://www.cha.go.kr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"ÏÉàÏ∞Ω : Î¨∏ÌôîÏû¨Ï≤≠ ÌôàÌéòÏù¥ÏßÄÎ°ú Ïù¥Îèô\">www.cha.go.kr](http://tour.jeonju.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.8118786778\nlongitude: 127.1608384836\ntitle: 2, Girin-daero, Wansan-gu, Jeonju-si, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR> From Jeonju Express Bus Terminal Bus Stop, take Bus No. 211, 221, 231, 241, or 251 bound for Nambu Market and get off at Jeondong Cathedral Bus Stop.<BR> Walk for approx. 10-20 min.\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-02-1672644947094","title":"Hanbyeokdang Pavilion (ÌïúÎ≤ΩÎãπ)","description":"Located in Jeollabuk-do province, Hanbyeokdang Pavilion has been designated Tangible Cultural Property No. 15.

For many years the temple lay incomplete until Monk Bojo Chejing began reconstruction in the 7th year of King Gyeongmun of Silla (AD 867). The temple was destroyed at one point in time, but Master Monk Jinul prayed that it be rebuilt. In accordance with his fervent hopes, in the 1600s the monk‚Äôs followers rebuilt a number of the temple‚Äôs halls and buildings, many of which can still be seen today. The temple is also remembered as the temple that King Injo helped rebuild with the hope that his two sons, who had been taken hostage by the Qing dynasty during the Byeongjahoran War (Chinese invasion of Korea in 1636), would be returned safely and that Buddha would heal the nation.<br><br> One of the Korea‚Äôs four major temples, Songgwangsa is home to Jijangbosal and Siwangsang statues (found in Jijangjeon Hall), a Seokgayeorae statue, and 500 Nahansang statues (found in Nahanjeon Hall).
