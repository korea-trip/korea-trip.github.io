The temple is widely believed to have been established by the great monk Uisang Daesa during the 16th year of King Munmu (676). However, some experts site the existence of the Namgeunseok stone animal sculpture as proof that the temple was originally the private temple of King Beop of the Baekje Kingdom. <br><br>Throughout history, the temple has had many names—Guksinsa, Gwisinsa, Gusunsa, and Gwisinsa (same English spelling, different meaning)—but not much is known about when the temple was called by which name. On the temple grounds are a 3-story stone pagoda and some stone sculptures including seoksu (animal statues) and budo (a stupa in honor of a great master). Inside the temple are Daejeokgwangjeon Hall (Treasure No.826), Myeongbujeon Hall, and Gongyangjib Chamber (a chamber for Buddhist offerings).\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-63-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-63-548-0917|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Not available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-02-1672630555982/176743_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-02-1672630555982/176743_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-02-1672630555982/176744_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-02-1672630555982/176744_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-02-1672630555982/612500_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-02-1672630555982/612500_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-02-1672630555982/196929_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-02-1672630555982/196929_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-63-548-0917](tel:+82635480917)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.7453148338\nlongitude: 127.0470225669\ntitle: 40, Cheongdo 6-gil, Gimje-si, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>\nFrom Jeonju Intercity/Express Bus Terminal, take Bus No. 79 and get off at Cheongdo-ri Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-02-1672630555982","title":"Gwisinsa Temple - Gimje (귀신사 - 김제)","description":"Gwisinsa, located in Cheongdo Village, Geumsan-myeon, Gimje-si, is now a temple of the Jogye Order, but once belonged to the Haweom Order.

For many years the temple lay incomplete until Monk Bojo Chejing began reconstruction in the 7th year of King Gyeongmun of Silla (AD 867). The temple was destroyed at one point in time, but Master Monk Jinul prayed that it be rebuilt. In accordance with his fervent hopes, in the 1600s the monk’s followers rebuilt a number of the temple’s halls and buildings, many of which can still be seen today. The temple is also remembered as the temple that King Injo helped rebuild with the hope that his two sons, who had been taken hostage by the Qing dynasty during the Byeongjahoran War (Chinese invasion of Korea in 1636), would be returned safely and that Buddha would heal the nation.<br><br> One of the Korea’s four major temples, Songgwangsa is home to Jijangbosal and Siwangsang statues (found in Jijangjeon Hall), a Seokgayeorae statue, and 500 Nahansang statues (found in Nahanjeon Hall). The temple is also home to eight Tangible Cultural Assets and four Treasured Cultural Assets  Daeungjeon Hall, the Samsebulsang statues, the bell-tower, and the Sacheonwangsang statue.<br><br>Beloved for its historical significance as well as its beauty, the temple draws throngs of worshipers throughout the year.
