For many years the temple lay incomplete until Monk Bojo Chejing began reconstruction in the 7th year of King Gyeongmun of Silla (AD 867). The temple was destroyed at one point in time, but Master Monk Jinul prayed that it be rebuilt. In accordance with his fervent hopes, in the 1600s the monk‚Äôs followers rebuilt a number of the temple‚Äôs halls and buildings, many of which can still be seen today. The temple is also remembered as the temple that King Injo helped rebuild with the hope that his two sons, who had been taken hostage by the Qing dynasty during the Byeongjahoran War (Chinese invasion of Korea in 1636), would be returned safely and that Buddha would heal the nation.<br><br> One of the Korea‚Äôs four major temples, Songgwangsa is home to Jijangbosal and Siwangsang statues (found in Jijangjeon Hall), a Seokgayeorae statue, and 500 Nahansang statues (found in Nahanjeon Hall). The temple is also home to eight Tangible Cultural Assets and four Treasured Cultural Assets  Daeungjeon Hall, the Samsebulsang statues, the bell-tower, and the Sacheonwangsang statue.<br><br>Beloved for its historical significance as well as its beauty, the temple draws throngs of worshipers throughout the year. In spring, many tourists flock to the area to explore the temple and walk through the nearby cherry blossom tunnels. A worthwhile attraction for visitors of all ages, the temple is particularly well-suited for those with mobility problems since it is located on ground level.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-63-243-8091|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year around)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-10-1673343382073/215129_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-10-1673343382073/215129_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-10-1673343382073/215442_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-10-1673343382073/215442_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-10-1673343382073/215445_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-10-1673343382073/215445_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-10-1673343382073/1605106_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-10-1673343382073/1605106_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-10-1673343382073/1605107_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-10-1673343382073/1605107_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-10-1673343382073/1605108_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-10-1673343382073/1605108_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-10-1673343382073/1605109_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-10-1673343382073/1605109_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-10-1673343382073/1605110_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-10-1673343382073/1605110_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-10-1673343382073/1605115_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-10-1673343382073/1605115_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-10-1673343382073/215443_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-10-1673343382073/215443_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-63-243-8091](tel:+82632438091)\n- [üè†songgwangsa.or.kr</a><br><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3gkth6Y\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"ÏÉàÏ∞Ω : ÏôÑÏ£ºÎ¨∏ÌôîÍ¥ÄÍ¥ë ÏÇ¨Ïù¥Ìä∏Î°ú Ïù¥Îèô\">www.wanju.go.kr]( http://songgwangsa.or.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.8842746273\nlongitude: 127.2417793808\ntitle: 255-16, Songgwangsuman-ro, Wanju-gun, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>\nFrom Jeonju Bus Terminal, take Bus No. 806, 814 or 838 and get off at Songgwangsa Temple Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-10-1673343382073","title":"Wanju Songgwangsa Temple (ÏÜ°Í¥ëÏÇ¨(ÏôÑÏ£º))","description":"Songgwangsa Temple in Wanju-gun, Jeollabuk-do has a unique history that spans a period of over a thousand years.
