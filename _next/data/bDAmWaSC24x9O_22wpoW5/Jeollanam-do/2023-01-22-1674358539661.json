The area is home to 27 historical and cultural sites and the beautiful Haebochoen Stream, which is shaded by over 40 different types of trees including zelkova trees, nettle trees, and willow trees. Some of the town‚Äôs traditional houses, which are about 80 years old, offer guesthouse accommodations to tourists.
