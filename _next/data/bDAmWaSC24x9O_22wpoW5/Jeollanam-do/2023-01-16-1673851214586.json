From the moment you start walking down the stonewall-lined path into town, this small village will capture your heart. The village’s important history (including its title as the origin of Hampyeong-gun of Jeollanam-do Province) is evident in everything you see  from the traditional houses to the 500-year old forest. The area is home to 27 historical and cultural sites and the beautiful Haebochoen Stream, which is shaded by over 40 different types of trees including zelkova trees, nettle trees, and willow trees. Some of the town’s traditional houses, which are about 80 years old, offer guesthouse accommodations to tourists. They include Mopyeongheon, Sopungga and Hisomun (a house made of yellow sod).<Br><Br>In addition to the beautiful country scenery, there is a great selection of available programs that highlight the area’s specialties, including  mulberry-picking, silkworm-feeding and Korean traditional sauce-making. You can also visit a traditional watermill, which has been restored, and swim and splash around in the forest stream. Visitors are encouraged to try their hand at making green tea cakes at the traditional teahouse nearby. <br><Br>The area of Mopyeong is full of things to entertain visitors, including a number of attractions and special events.

Wolyangsan.","regDate":"2023-01-26","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollanam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Folk Villages"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-26-1674715167198/1810076_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollanam-do/2023-01-26-1674715167198"},{"id":"2023-01-26-1674711379193","title":"Mokpo Special Tourist Zone (목포 관광특구)","description":"Mokpo is a designated special tourist zone for marine culture tourism.
