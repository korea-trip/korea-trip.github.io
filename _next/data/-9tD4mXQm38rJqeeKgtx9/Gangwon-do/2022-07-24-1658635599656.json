It is here that Jeongseon Arirang, the No. 1 Intangible Cultural Asset of Gangwon-do, originated. The area has long been famous for its beautiful, clean mountains and rivers. Its name is derived from the Korean word <em>eoureojida,</em> meaning \"to meet\" as the waters of Pyeongchang and Samcheok unite in this area.<br>\n<br>Part of the upper stream of Namhangang River, Auraji was a famous starting point of log rafts transporting timber to Hanyang, the original name of Seoul. In the old days, one could always hear the singing of boatmen who came from all over the nation. The lyrics of Jeongseon Arirang reveal the sadness and longing of a woman awaiting her husband who left for business to a far-away place or left to transport timber.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(English, Korean, Japanese, Chinese)<br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-1544-9053|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-24-1658635599656/1583475_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658635599656/1583475_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658635599656/175656_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658635599656/175656_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658635599656/179487_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658635599656/179487_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658635599656/179492_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658635599656/179492_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658635599656/2365263_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658635599656/2365263_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658635599656/2365265_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658635599656/2365265_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658635599656/2395942_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658635599656/2395942_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658635599656/2395943_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658635599656/2395943_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-1544-9053](tel:+8215449053)\n- [üè†www.ariaritour.com](http://www.ariaritour.com)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.4758305379\nlongitude: 128.7239879300\ntitle: 69, Auraji-gil, Jeongseon-gun, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Dong Seoul Bus Terminal, take a bus to Jeongseon Bus Terminal.<BR>From Jeongseon Bus Terminal Bus Stop, take a local bus bound for Yeoryang.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-24-1658635599656","title":"Auraji Lake (ÏïÑÏö∞ÎùºÏßÄ)","description":"Auraji is the name of a lake located in Yeoryang-myeon in Jeongseon-gun.

Biryongpokpo Falls is located between Towangseong Falls in the upper region and Yukdam Falls in the lower region. Biryongpokpo Falls was named after the shape of the water stream of the falls (pokpo) resembling a dragon (ryong) ascending (bi) to heaven. Their powerful water streams pouring into the narrow and rough valley look like a legendary dragon. There is another tale associated with Biryongpokpo Falls. A dragon lived here, and one day villagers offered a maiden to the dragon to break the drought. Then, the dragon flew up to the sky, and there were no more droughts in the village. The waterfalls drop 16 m to the ground and their loud sound resonates in the valley. In winter, the waterfalls freeze and the frozen water columns offer another magnificent view. A clear pond is formed beneath the falls and around which there is a wooden observation deck. Biryongpokpo Falls and Surroundings in Seoraksan Mountain were designated as the Scenic Site No. 95. It takes about 1 hr from the Small Park to the Biryongpokpo Falls, while it takes about 3 hr (round-trip) to visit up to Towangseong Falls and Yukdam Falls. The difficulty level of this tour course is ordinary.","regDate":"2022-10-21","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Waterfalls"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-21-1666342637738"},{"id":"2022-10-21-1666338656222","title":"Baengnyongdonggul Cave-Gangwon Paleozoic Geopark (Î∞±Î£°ÎèôÍµ¥-Í∞ïÏõêÍ≥†ÏÉùÎåÄ Íµ≠Í∞ÄÏßÄÏßàÍ≥µÏõê)","description":"Baengnyongdonggul Cave is a 1.8„éû-long, natural limestone cave located in Pyeongchang-gun, Gangwon-do.
