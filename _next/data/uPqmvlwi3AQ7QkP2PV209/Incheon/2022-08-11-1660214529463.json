Wolmi Culture Street opened in July 1989 and helped improve the area's fame. <br /><br />On weekends and holidays, people flock to Wolmido Island to enjoy coffee and fresh seafood at the cafes and restaurants overlooking the sea. Despite being 1 kilometer off the coast, Wolmido is no longer an island, being connected to the mainland through modern construction techniques. It is now an easily accessible retreat for locals and tourists alike.","regDate":"2022-08-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-12-1660332941155/1577671_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-08-12-1660332941155"},{"id":"2022-08-12-1660329964728","title":"Wolmi Theme Park (ÏõîÎØ∏ÌÖåÎßàÌååÌÅ¨)","description":"Wolmi Theme Park is a popular amusement park complex located on Wolmido Island.
