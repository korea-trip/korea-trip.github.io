The communist Chinese army launched a major offensive attack for 10 days on October 6, 1952 during the Battle of Baengmagoji, which can be translated into the Battle of White Horse Highlands. Due to this battle, the communist Chinese army suffered around 14,000 casualties and the army completely collapsed while the 9th Infantry Division won the Battle of Baengmagoji and got the nickname ‚ÄúWhite Horse.‚Äù <br><br>After the battle, the area gave off a bad smell because of the dead bodies. The mountain area lost its original shape due to the severe battle and as a result the area was named ‚ÄúBaengmagoji‚Äù as it was said to resemble a white horse (baengma) lying down.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-33-450-5559|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Tour Course Information:|Baengma Station - Daema-ri Guard Post - The 2nd Tunnel - Peace Observatory - Woljeong-ri Station - Labor Party Office - Baengma Station|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Memorial Hall of Baengmagoji Battle, Monument for Baengmagoji Battle, Memorial Stone for Baengmagoji Battle, etc. |\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-10-05-1664956394526/2494536_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-05-1664956394526/2494536_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-05-1664956394526/2494537_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-05-1664956394526/2494537_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-05-1664956394526/2494538_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-05-1664956394526/2494538_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-05-1664956394526/2494539_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-05-1664956394526/2494539_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-05-1664956394526/2494540_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-05-1664956394526/2494540_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-05-1664956394526/2494541_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-05-1664956394526/2494541_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-05-1664956394526/2494542_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-05-1664956394526/2494542_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-05-1664956394526/2494545_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-05-1664956394526/2494545_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-33-450-5559](tel:+82334505559)\n- [üè†www.cwg.go.kr</a> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br><a href=\"http://hantan.cwg.go.kr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"new window popup\" class=\"web\">hantan.cwg.go.kr](http://www.cwg.go.kr/site/tour/main.do)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 38.2700172415\nlongitude: 127.1652863536\ntitle: 72, Daema 1-gil, Cheorwon-gun, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Train + Taxi]<br>\nBaengmagoji Station (Gyeongwon Line) <br>Take a taxi for approx, 4 min. to the venue.\n","data":{"id":"2022-10-05-1664956394526","title":"Memorial Tower of Baengmagoji Battlefield and Memorial Museum (Î∞±ÎßàÍ≥†ÏßÄ ÏúÑÎ†πÎπÑÏôÄ Í∏∞ÎÖêÍ¥Ä)","description":"Located in the northern area of South Korea, Baengmagoji Battlefield was one of the bloodiest battlefields during the Korean War.
