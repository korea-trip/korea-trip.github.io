Cheongwansan Mountain is a rocky mountain with steep peaks. Red camellia flowers bloom in spring, while in fall, silver grass blankets the area, creating a spectacular scene. The mountain peak offers an incredible ocean view due to the mountains close location to the coast. To the south, the vast Dadohae Sea comes into view, and hikers may even get a glimpse of Hallasan Mountain from afar on a clear sunny day. A landscape of different mountain ridges can be seen to the north, namely Wolchulsan Mountain in Yeongam, Jeamsan Mountain in Jangheung, and Mudeungsan Mountain in Gwangju. <br><br> Cheongwansa Temple is located within a few hundred meters of the peak of the mountain. The recreational park is equipped with convenient facilities and a well-managed 7-kilometer-long hiking trail, serving as a great vacation spot for weekend getaways.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-61-867-6974|\n|opendate:|1995|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|Tuesdays|\n|usetime:|[Accommodations] Check in 15:00 / Check out 12:00 <br>[Park hours] 09:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals: Adults 1,000 won / Teenagers 600 won / Children 300 won<br>Groups: Adults 800 won / Teenagers 500 won / Children 200 won<br><br>[Accommodations]<BR>House of Forest: 40,000-154,000 won<BR>Yeonlip-dong: 40,000-94,000 won|\n|Available Facilities:|Accommodations, camping ground|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-15-1673768136110/2704939_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-15-1673768136110/2704939_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-15-1673768136110/2704940_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-15-1673768136110/2704940_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-15-1673768136110/2704941_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-15-1673768136110/2704941_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-15-1673768136110/2704943_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-15-1673768136110/2704943_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-15-1673768136110/2704945_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-15-1673768136110/2704945_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-15-1673768136110/2704946_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-15-1673768136110/2704946_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-61-867-6974](tel:+82618676974)\n- [üè†www.foresttrip.go.kr](https://www.foresttrip.go.kr/indvz/main.do?hmpgId=0196)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 34.5451339297\nlongitude: 126.8998851572\ntitle: 842-1150, Chilgwan-ro, Jangheung-gun, Jeollanam-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-15-1673768136110","title":"Cheongwansan National Recreational Forest (Íµ≠Î¶Ω Ï≤úÍ¥ÄÏÇ∞ÏûêÏó∞Ìú¥ÏñëÎ¶º)","description":"Cheongwansan National Recreational Forest is located at the entrance of one of the five great mountains of the Jeolla region.

Most dinosaur tracks found in Korea are located in coastal areas in cities like Haenam and Boseong, so the discovery in the inner region of Jeollanam-do was a first. Most prints here come from carnivorous dinaosaurs of the Cretaceous period. The site is famous for there being tracks from no fewer than five different dinosaurs, as well as for being one of the longest trails and most direct examples of the exact movements of the dinosaurs. The tracks of one dinosaur are the longest in the world, stretching for 40 meters. Based on the foot size of 20-22 centimeters with a stride of approximately 90 centimeters, it is estimated that the prints were formed by a 4-5 meter tall Koolasuchus. In addition to the canivorous dinosaurs, tracks were found of 12 herbivorous dinosaurs, as well as fossilized plants. These plants offer much assistance in the research of herbivorous dinosaur diets.","regDate":"2023-01-17","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollanam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Eco-Tourism Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-17-1673944760289/1608223_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollanam-do/2023-01-17-1673944760289"},{"id":"2023-01-17-1673933770532","title":"Dasan Chodang (Historic Site Related to Jeong Yak-yong) (Îã§ÏÇ∞Ï¥àÎãπ (Îã§ÏÇ∞ Ï†ïÏïΩÏö© Ïú†Ï†ÅÏßÄ))","description":"Dasan Chodang is the house where Jeong Yak-yong (pen-name Dasan, 1762-1836) lived during his exile.

After he was expelled to Ganjin for writing a secret letter of appeal for religious freedom, which later was named ‚Äòthe Hwang Sa-yeong Baekseo‚Äô, he lived in the house for 18 years while studying practical learning (‚ÄòSilhak‚Äô in Korean). Most of his famous books were written in Dasan Chodang. While walking along a road near Dasan Chodang, you can see the Cheonilgak pavilion, which offers a great view of beautiful Gangjin Bay.

Metasequoia trees were planted along the street in the early 1970s by the Ministry of Internal Affairs after National Road 24 was rebuilt. At that time, the saplings were only 3 to 4 years old and their branches stretched sparsely out into the sky; now, the trees have grown so high that they seem to block out the sun. Thanks to these stately trees, in 2002 the Korea Forest Service selected the boulevard as one of the most beautiful roads in Korea. The 8.5-kilometer-long boulevard is one of the most popular driving routes in Korea, especially during summer when the trees&rsquo; lush green leaves are at their x_height of beauty.","regDate":"2023-01-16","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollanam-do","Culture/Art/History","Experience Programs","Cultural Districts"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-16-1673865516648/2650840_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollanam-do/2023-01-16-1673865516648"},{"id":"2023-01-16-1673861765838","title":"Damyang Changpyeong Samjinae Village [Slow City] (Îã¥Ïñë Ï∞ΩÌèâ ÏÇºÏßÄÎÇ¥ÎßàÏùÑ[Ïä¨Î°úÏãúÌã∞])","description":"Damyang Changpyeong Samjinae Village was the first Korean place designated as a slow city in 2007.
