Most dinosaur tracks found in Korea are located in coastal areas in cities like Haenam and Boseong, so the discovery in the inner region of Jeollanam-do was a first. Most prints here come from carnivorous dinaosaurs of the Cretaceous period. The site is famous for there being tracks from no fewer than five different dinosaurs, as well as for being one of the longest trails and most direct examples of the exact movements of the dinosaurs. The tracks of one dinosaur are the longest in the world, stretching for 40 meters. Based on the foot size of 20-22 centimeters with a stride of approximately 90 centimeters, it is estimated that the prints were formed by a 4-5 meter tall Koolasuchus. In addition to the canivorous dinosaurs, tracks were found of 12 herbivorous dinosaurs, as well as fossilized plants. These plants offer much assistance in the research of herbivorous dinosaur diets.","regDate":"2023-01-17","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollanam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Eco-Tourism Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-17-1673944760289/1608223_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollanam-do/2023-01-17-1673944760289"},{"id":"2023-01-17-1673933770532","title":"Dasan Chodang (Historic Site Related to Jeong Yak-yong) (Îã§ÏÇ∞Ï¥àÎãπ (Îã§ÏÇ∞ Ï†ïÏïΩÏö© Ïú†Ï†ÅÏßÄ))","description":"Dasan Chodang is the house where Jeong Yak-yong (pen-name Dasan, 1762-1836) lived during his exile. He was a scholar of the late Joseon dynasty and is noted for his great contributions to the development of practical learning in Korea. After he was expelled to Ganjin for writing a secret letter of appeal for religious freedom, which later was named ‚Äòthe Hwang Sa-yeong Baekseo‚Äô, he lived in the house for 18 years while studying practical learning (‚ÄòSilhak‚Äô in Korean). Most of his famous books were written in Dasan Chodang. While walking along a road near Dasan Chodang, you can see the Cheonilgak pavilion, which offers a great view of beautiful Gangjin Bay. Not far from Dasan Chodang is the Dasan Museum, where visitors can learn about the life of Dasan.","regDate":"2023-01-17","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollanam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-17-1673933770532/2434117_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollanam-do/2023-01-17-1673933770532"},{"id":"2023-01-17-1673930344753","title":"Damyangho Lake (Îã¥ÏñëÌò∏)","description":"Damyangho Lake is a man-made lake, created in 1976 with the construction of a dam on Yeongsangang River.

Metasequoia trees were planted along the street in the early 1970s by the Ministry of Internal Affairs after National Road 24 was rebuilt. At that time, the saplings were only 3 to 4 years old and their branches stretched sparsely out into the sky; now, the trees have grown so high that they seem to block out the sun. Thanks to these stately trees, in 2002 the Korea Forest Service selected the boulevard as one of the most beautiful roads in Korea. The 8.5-kilometer-long boulevard is one of the most popular driving routes in Korea, especially during summer when the trees&rsquo; lush green leaves are at their x_height of beauty.","regDate":"2023-01-16","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollanam-do","Culture/Art/History","Experience Programs","Cultural Districts"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-16-1673865516648/2650840_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollanam-do/2023-01-16-1673865516648"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
