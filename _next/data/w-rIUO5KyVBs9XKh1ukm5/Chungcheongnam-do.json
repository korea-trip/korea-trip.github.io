His house is the oldest private residence in Korea, and was originally General Choi Yeong’s home, before he turned it over to his grand son-in-law, Maeng Sa-seong. The simple residence houses two 600-year-old gingko trees in the yard. Therefore it has been named ‘Haengdan’, meaning that Confucius taught on top of the gingko tree symbolizing a place of learning. For that reason it is inferred that Maeng Sa-seong intentionally planted gingko trees in the yard and taught junior scholars. The two gingko trees provide a cool shade and give out five sacks of gingko nuts each year.","regDate":"2022-07-28","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Old Houses"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-28-1658986913216/1495766_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Chungcheongnam-do/2022-07-28-1658986913216","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Chungcheongnam-do/2022-07-28-1658986913216"},{"id":"2022-07-28-1658984540847","title":"Archaeological Site in Seokjang-ri, Gongju (공주 석장리 유적)","description":"The Archaeological Site in Seokjang-ri, Gongju is located approximately 6 kilometers out of the city of Gongju, on the northern banks of the Geumgang River.
