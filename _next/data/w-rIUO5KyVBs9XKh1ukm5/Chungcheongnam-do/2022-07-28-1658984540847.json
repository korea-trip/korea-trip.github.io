His house is the oldest private residence in Korea, and was originally General Choi Yeong‚Äôs home, before he turned it over to his grand son-in-law, Maeng Sa-seong. The simple residence houses two 600-year-old gingko trees in the yard. Therefore it has been named ‚ÄòHaengdan‚Äô, meaning that Confucius taught on top of the gingko tree symbolizing a place of learning. For that reason it is inferred that Maeng Sa-seong intentionally planted gingko trees in the yard and taught junior scholars. The two gingko trees provide a cool shade and give out five sacks of gingko nuts each year.","regDate":"2022-07-28","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Old Houses"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-28-1658986913216/1495766_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Chungcheongnam-do/2022-07-28-1658986913216"},{"id":"2022-07-28-1658981694068","title":"Anmyeondo Island Recreational Forest (ÏïàÎ©¥ÎèÑÏûêÏó∞Ìú¥ÏñëÎ¶º)","description":"Anmyeondo in Taean is home to a 100 year old pine tree forest that is special in Korea.

The peninsula connected to Nammyeon was isolated during the Joseon Dynasty by cutting off access between Changgi-ri in Anmyeon-eup and Shinon-ri in Nammyeon for the convenience of tax transportation. The island's coast is lined with some 14 beaches as well as abundant pine trees, which are symbols of Anmyeon-eup. The island also owns Anmyeondo Natural Forest, along with the Mogamju Forest (Natural Monument No. 138).","regDate":"2022-07-28","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongnam-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-28-1658975944792/2426575_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Chungcheongnam-do/2022-07-28-1658975944792","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Chungcheongnam-do/2022-07-28-1658975944792"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
