{"pageProps":{"content":"![Maisan Hwaeomgul Cave (마이산 화엄굴)](/2023-01-06-1672976184633/198644_image2_1.webp)\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> Maisan Mountain has two major peaks made of sedimentary rocks; these peaks are said to be ‘couple peaks’ and cannot be found anywhere else. Sut Maibong (alt. 667 meters) is said to be the male peak while the slightly larger Am Maibong (alt. 673 meters) is deemed the female peak. In the early Joseon period the mountain was named ‘Sokgeumsan,’ but began to be called ‘Maisan’ after the 12th year of King Taejong, who commented that the two peaks resembled horse ears (‘maisan’ meaning ‘horse ears’). All along Maisan Mountain, visitors will find small crater-like rock cavities that are formed by prolonged weathering. These unique geological features, called ‘tafoni,’ are of great academic value. <br><br>Inside Hwaeomgul Cave, visitors can observe medicinal water that flows up from underground all throughout the year. It is widely believed that once you drink the water, especially on the days of the Spring and Autumn Equinox, you will soon have a son and be blessed by the mountain spirit. Even today, many women who have difficulty conceiving visit the mountain to pray to the mountain spirits for their heart’s desire—the gift of a child. The region in which Maisan is located is the birthplace of many talented people and national heroes, which some say is proof of the blessings of the mountain and its extremely powerful spirit.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-63-430-8751~5|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-06-1672976184633/198646_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-06-1672976184633/198646_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-06-1672976184633/198647_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-06-1672976184633/198647_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-06-1672976184633/198648_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-06-1672976184633/198648_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-63-430-8751](tel:+82634308751)\n- [🏠tour.jinan.go.kr](http://tour.jinan.go.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.7596501179\nlongitude: 127.4127035856\ntitle: 367, Maisannam-ro, Jinan-gun, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>\nFrom Jeonju Intercity Bus Terminal, take an intercity bus to Jinan Bus Terminal.<br>From Jinan Bus Terminal, take a bus bound for Maisan.\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-06-1672976184633","title":"Maisan Hwaeomgul Cave (마이산 화엄굴)","description":"Maisan Mountain has two major peaks made of sedimentary rocks; these peaks are said to be ‘couple peaks’ and cannot be found anywhere else.
