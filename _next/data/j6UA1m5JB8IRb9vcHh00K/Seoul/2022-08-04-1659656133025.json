The theme park provides children with a chance to experience jobs that they might want to have when they grow up! Job experiences include working as a policeman, flight attendant, firefighter, or chef (uniforms are provided). When you work hard in Kidzania, you get paid in Kidzo (a virtual currency). You can put your money in the bank for your next visit or purchase goods at the department store. In order to make the environment as realistic as possible, every building, car, and tree is reduced to 2/3 its real size, helping children feel more adult-like in their new world! Kidzania mimics a real city environment, has diverse jobs, and is full of events. When there is a fire, a fireman rushes to help, and a news reporter covers the story. While 911 paramedics give first aid to fire victims, in another part of ‚Äútown‚Äù delivery personnel are dropping off packages. Kidzania teaches the next generation how to live as responsible members of society and gives them an introduction to how the economy works.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-1544-5110|\n|opendate:|February 27, 2010|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)<br>* Subject to closure; refer to the website for details|\n|usetime:|Session 1 10:00-15:00 <br>Session 2 15:00-19:30<br>All-day pass (Session 1 & 2) 10:00-19:30|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Film Locations:|Various variety shows|\n|Available Facilities:|[Experience facilities]<br>Bank, acting school, driving tracks, fire emergency department, flower atelier, extreme climbing, voice recording studio, hospital, robotics laboratory, photo studio, TV studio, police station, radio studio, magic school, and more. <br><br>[Convenience facilities]<br>Information center, storage lockers, lost and found, nurse office, parents lounge, nursery, etc.<BR><BR>[Restaurants &  others]<BR>Kidzania Cafeteria, multishop, Airshop, National Store, Kid's Corner, Snow Town, Candy Shop, Smoothie King, Lotteria, etc.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|Children: Session 1 42,000 won / Session 2 38,000 won / All-day pass 61,000 won<br>Guardian: Session 1 19,000 won / Session 2 17,000 won / All-day pass 20,000 won <br>3-Hour Ticket - Children 25,000 won / Guardian 11,000 won<br>(Session 1 - Admission after 12:00 / Session 2 - Admission after 16:30)<br><br>* Children (ages 3-16) / Guardian (ages 17 and older)<br>* Children below 10 years old must be accompanied by a guardian<br>* Guardians are not allowed to enter without accompanying a child<br>* Babies (ages 3 or younger): Free admission (participation in hands-on programs not allowed)|\n|Parking Fees:|Weekdays - First 3 hours free / 3,000 won charged for additional 3 hours<br>Weekends & public holidays: First 3 hours free / 11,200 won charged for additional 3 hours<br />* Guests using Lotte World parking lot can apply for 3 free hours at the Kidzania information desk.|\n|Reservation Info. for Foreigners:|Tickets can be purchased on-site|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-04-1659656133025/2031376_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659656133025/2031376_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659656133025/2031379_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659656133025/2031379_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659656133025/2031381_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659656133025/2031381_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659656133025/2031382_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659656133025/2031382_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-1544-5110](tel:+8215445110)\n- [üè†www.kidzania.co.kr](http://www.kidzania.co.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5110683960\nlongitude: 127.0981394766\ntitle: 240, Olympic-ro, Songpa-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway]<br>\nJamsil Station (Seoul Subway Line 2), Exit 4.<br>\nGo straight 300m towards Lotte World.<br>\nTurn left in front of the outdoor parking lot to arrive at the Kidzania.\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-04-1659656133025","title":"Kidzania Seoul (ÌÇ§ÏûêÎãàÏïÑ ÏÑúÏö∏)","description":"Kidzania, located in Jamsil, Songpa-gu, Seoul, is a unique family entertainment space especially for children ages 3 to 16.

This village has five restored hanok (traditional Korean house) premises, a pavilion, traditional garden, performance art stage and a time capsule plaza, making it a perfect spot for both locals and tourists to take a leisure walk. Upon entering from the front gate, visitors will get a taste of Korea's traditional life while escaping from the bustling city life. The traditional garden with its pavilion and old houses creates a peaceful ambiance before the forested Namsan Mountain. A time capsule commemorating Seoul‚Äôs 600th anniversary was buried in 1994 at the highest point of the village and is scheduled to be reopened 400 years later in 2394. <br><br> The five hanok premises at Namsangol Hanok Village once belonged to aristocrats and government officials of the Joseon dynasty. Each house was originally located in different neighborhoods, but they were all moved to this area and restored to their original form. The houses were rebuilt using their original materials, except for one house, where the materials were too old and deteriorated to be reused. The premises were carefully restored and replicated according to their original form to depict the owners‚Äô social class and personality. These buildings are now used as an exhibit to portray the living environment during the Joseon dynasty as well as a venue for educational and cultural programs for children and tourists.<br><br>Some of the noteworthy programs and activities to participate in include wearing hanbok, folding hanji (traditional Korean paper), writing in Korean, traditional tea ceremony, traditional etiquette school and herbal medicine experience. There are also taekwondo demonstrations and other various performances held around the village. Visitors can also try traditional games such as <em>yunnori</em> (traditional board game), or understand more about the area through a guided tour.","regDate":"2022-08-06","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Folk Villages"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-06-1659818310507/1946562_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-08-06-1659818310507"},{"id":"2022-08-06-1659814596495","title":"Namsan Seoul Tower Hanbok Culture Experience Center (ÎÇ®ÏÇ∞ÏÑúÏö∏ÌÉÄÏõå ÌïúÎ≥µÎ¨∏ÌôîÏ≤¥ÌóòÍ¥Ä)","description":"Namsan Seoul Tower Hanbok Culture Experience Center is located in the lobby level (B1) of Seoul's landmark Namsan Seoul Tower.
