It was originally a separate island, but a build-up of sand and soil has connected it to the main island.  A large crater, formed by the hot lava mixing with cold ocean water, is located at the top of Seongsan Ilchulbong Tuff Cone. The crater is about 600 meters in diameter and 90 meters deep. It has been featured in films, and was originally used for agriculture, but has now been given over to a field of silver grass. From the summit, visitors can see Udo Island, as well as take in the magnificent sunrise. The tuff cone area was designated as a natural reserve on July 19, 2000.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <BR>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-64-710-7923|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|First Monday of every month|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00<BR>* Hours subject to change|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Shop, pergola, etc.|\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 5,000 won / Teenagers & Children 2,500 won<br />Groups - Adults 4,000 won / Teenagers & Children 2,000 won<br />* Free admission: Senior citizens (ages 65 and older), preschoolers (ages 6 and younger)<BR> * Groups: 10 people or more<br />* Adults (ages 25-64), Teenagers (ages 13-24), Children (ages 7-12)|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Available in Chinese|\n  \n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-64-710-7923](tel:+82647107923)\n- [🏠www.jeju.go.kr](http://www.jeju.go.kr/jejuwnh/index.htm)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.4581111174\nlongitude: 126.9415156012\ntitle: 284-12, Ilchul-ro, Seogwipo-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\n From Jeju Intercity Bus Terminal, take a Direct Bus bound for Seongsan and get off at Seongsalliipgu Bus Stop. <br>\nWalk for approx. 1 km.\n","data":{"id":"2023-02-12-1676194558158","title":"Seongsan Ilchulbong Tuff Cone [UNESCO World Heritage] (성산일출봉 [유네스코 세계문화유산])","description":"Seongsan Ilchulbong Tuff Cone rose 180 meters above sea level due to a magma flow under the sea over 5,000 years ago.

It is thought to have been created by the lava that erupted from Hallasan Mountain some 25 million years ago. This cave uniquely contains features of both lava and limestone caves. The entire area surrounding the cave is a huge stratum of seashells and sand, while the interior of the cave has a mystical ambience due to its various formations such as stalactites and stalagmites, hanging from the ceiling and sprouting up from the bottom of the cave. The cave also features pillars formed when stalactites and stalagmites join together. The cave walls are covered in lime, which at times looks like beautiful cave paintings. The temperature inside the cave stays at 17~18℃ throughout the year, making the cave a welcome escape from the summer heat and a great place to keep warm during winter. <Br><Br>Hyeopjaegul Lava Tube has been designated Natural Monument No. 236 and ranks among the world’s major mysterious caves, such as the stone salt cave of Peru and the underwater limestone caves of Yugoslavia.
