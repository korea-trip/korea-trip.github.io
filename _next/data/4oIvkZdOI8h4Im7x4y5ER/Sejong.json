The Geungnakbojeon Hall and the three-storied pagoda inside the temple have been designated as Cultural Properties of Chungcheongnam-do Province. The flamboyang and delicately crafted datjip (canopy) inside the Geungnakbojeon Hall was restored in 1657 during the 8th year of King Hyojong's reign.<br><br>In the yard in front of the Geungnakbojeon Hall stands the three meter-high Samcheungseoktap (three-storied stone pagoda). With the discovery of Samyeongunsang stone statues near the top of the pagoda, Biamsa Temple became more widely known to the public. Among the stone statues, Gyeyumyeongjeonssi-amitabul-samjonseoksang (three Buddha statues) has been named as National Treasure No. 106, and Gichukmyeong-amitayeorae-jebulbosalseoksang (statue of Amitabha bodhisattva) and Mireukbosal-bangaseoksang (statue of Maitreya bodhisattva) have been designated as National Treasures No. 367 and No. 368, respectively.
