The Geungnakbojeon Hall and the three-storied pagoda inside the temple have been designated as Cultural Properties of Chungcheongnam-do Province. The flamboyang and delicately crafted datjip (canopy) inside the Geungnakbojeon Hall was restored in 1657 during the 8th year of King Hyojong's reign.<br><br>\nIn the yard in front of the Geungnakbojeon Hall stands the three meter-high Samcheungseoktap (three-storied stone pagoda). With the discovery of Samyeongunsang stone statues near the top of the pagoda, Biamsa Temple became more widely known to the public. Among the stone statues, Gyeyumyeongjeonssi-amitabul-samjonseoksang (three Buddha statues) has been named as National Treasure No. 106, and Gichukmyeong-amitayeorae-jebulbosalseoksang (statue of Amitabha bodhisattva) and Mireukbosal-bangaseoksang (statue of Maitreya bodhisattva) have been designated as National Treasures No. 367 and No. 368, respectively. The stone statues are preserved in National Museum of Korea. Meanwhile, the three-storied stone pagoda was designated as Tangible Cultural Property No. 119 of Chungcheongnam-do Province on July 19, 1985.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <BR>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-44-863-0230|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Activity Fees:|Free|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-17-1658031749066/1601622_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-17-1658031749066/1601622_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-17-1658031749066/1601623_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-17-1658031749066/1601623_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-17-1658031749066/1601624_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-17-1658031749066/1601624_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-17-1658031749066/1601625_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-17-1658031749066/1601625_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-17-1658031749066/1601626_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-17-1658031749066/1601626_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-17-1658031749066/1601627_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-17-1658031749066/1601627_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-17-1658031749066/1601628_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-17-1658031749066/1601628_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-17-1658031749066/1601629_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-17-1658031749066/1601629_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-17-1658031749066/1601630_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-17-1658031749066/1601630_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-17-1658031749066/1601632_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-17-1658031749066/1601632_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-44-863-0230](tel:+82448630230)\n- [üè†cafe.daum.net/bas0230](http://cafe.daum.net/bas0230/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.6114045131\nlongitude: 127.1920532311\ntitle: 137, Biamsa-gil, Sejong-si\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>\nTake an intercity bus to Jochiwon Bus Terminal.<br>From Jochiwon Bus Terminal, go 250 m towards Jochiwon Station, turn right at the Yeokjeon Interchange, and go 150 m forward.<br>From the bus stop ahead, take Bus No. 820 or 830 and get off at Dabang 1(il)-ri Bus Stop.<br>Walk for approx. 1km to Biamsa Temple.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-17-1658031749066","title":"Biamsa Temple - Sejong (ÎπÑÏïîÏÇ¨(ÏÑ∏Ï¢Ö))","description":"The origin of Biamsa Temple is unknown, but the temple's architectural features suggest that it was built during the mid Goryeo dynasty period (918-1392).
