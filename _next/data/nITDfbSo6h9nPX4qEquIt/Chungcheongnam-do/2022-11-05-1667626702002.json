Originally, the tree had three branches, but two were broken and the third branch was damaged. In 1980, the damaged branch was treated and since then, the tree has been kept under strong protection.","regDate":"2022-11-08","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Old Houses"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-08-1667904363151/2357922_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Chungcheongnam-do/2022-11-08-1667904363151"},{"id":"2022-11-08-1667900379232","title":"Hongwonhang Port (홍원항)","description":"Hongwonhang Port, located near Chunjangdae Beach, is a popular place for enjoying sea fishing and delectable meals of fresh raw fish.
