It offers splendid scenery and many neighboring tourist attractions, such as Gugok Falls, Deungseon Falls, and Samaksan Mountain. It has excellent accessibility of public transportation, many theme park facilities, and accommodation facilities, so it has been a popular location for a young people’s membership trip from the 1970s to the 1990s. However, along with the opening of the double-track railway on the Gyeongchun Line in 2010, the Gangchon Station building was relocated and consequently, the number of visitors has decreased and the local business experienced depression. Therefore, there has been a campaign to revitalize Gangchon. Near the former Gangchon Station, the large sculpture “Ddo-ori Gangchon” has been installed, and the reduced-size model of the Deungseongyo Bridge (suspension bridge), which was a famous tourist attraction in the past, has been reproduced. In particular, “Ddo-ori Gangchon,” which is a popular photo zone, was built by embodying the Scaly-side Merganser (Mergus squamatus, Natural Monument No. 448), which come the area of Gangchon in winter. Additionally, the Deungseongyo Bridge, which was Korea’s first suspension bridge, but demolished in 1985, was reproduced as a tourist pedestrian bridge with a length of 58 m. Furthermore, Gangchon Land, which is a well-known theme park, and the activity of four-wheel motorcycle riding along the riverside, are also major tourist attractions in Gangchon.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-33-250-3896|\n|parking:|Not allowed|\n|restdate:|Open year round|\n|usetime:|00:00–24:00|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-09-22-1663840048251/1583492_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-22-1663840048251/1583492_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-22-1663840048251/2364894_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-22-1663840048251/2364894_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-33-250-3896](tel:+82332503896)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.8157038798\nlongitude: 127.6325486998\ntitle: The area of Namsan-myeon, Chuncheon-si, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Chuncheon Intercity Bus Terminal, take a local city bus headed for Seoul and get off at Gangchon Bus Stop. <br>\n<BR>\n[Train]<br>\nFrom Cheongnyangni Station take trains heading to Gangchon Station. <br>\nWalk for approx. 5 min.\n","data":{"id":"2022-09-22-1663840048251","title":"Gangchon Resort (강촌유원지)","description":"The Gangchon Resort, as one of Chuncheon’s major resorts, stretches along the Bukhangang River and the Gangchoncheon Stream.

The lake is adjacent to the areas of Jangsa-dong, Yeongnang-dong, Dongmyeong-dong, and Geumho-dong. The pleasant trail is also established around the lakeside, surrounded by the beautiful scenery of cherry blossoms, azaleas, and reeds. According to Samguk yusa (Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms), the name of the lake comes from Silla’s hwarang (elite warrior group in Silla) member named “Yeongnang.” After training at Geumgangsan Mountain, Yeongnang passed this lake on the way to get to the martial arts competition. As he was so taken by the splendid landscape, however, he forgot about the competition and stayed here for a long time. As the old record says, Yeongnangho Lake boasts outstanding scenery. Beombawi Rock, in particular, evokes visitors’ admiration as one of the Eight Sights of Sokcho. The rock, which resembles the shape of a tiger crouching down, has an aura of mystery. The nearby tourist attractions also include Gwaneumam Rock, which is known for the strange rocks and bizarre stones, Bogwangsa Temple, and the Wetland Eco Park, which is located in the west of the lakeside.","regDate":"2022-10-18","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-18-1666090450530/2711165_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-18-1666090450530"},{"id":"2022-10-18-1666086911905","title":"Yanggu Punch Bowl Village (양구 펀치볼마을 (펀치볼))","description":"Punch Bowl is a highland basin situated 400-500 meters above sea level in Yanggu-gun, Gangwon-do.
