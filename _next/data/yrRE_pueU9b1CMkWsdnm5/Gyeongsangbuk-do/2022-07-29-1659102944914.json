The temple was founded by Great Monk Uisang (625-702) upon orders from the king. When Uisang was studying in the Dang dynasty of China, he heard of a plot by the Dang dynasty to attack Silla. Upon hearing this, he hurried home and passed the message along to the king. The temple was created to pray for protection of the country.<br><br>\n\nBuseoksa Temple gets its name from a large stone to the west of Buljeon Hall, that appears to be floating rather than supported by the stone beneath it. During the Goryeo dynasty, the temple was referred to Seondalsa Temple or Heunggyosa Temple. During excavation work in 1916, records of the temple's repair work were discovered. According to these findings, it was learned that Muryangsujeon Hall and other buildings were rebuilt in the early part of the Goryeo dynasty. The hall burned down during war in 1358, and was later rebuilt in 1376. Josadang Shrine was rebuilt in 1377.<br><br> \n\nBuseoksa Temple is home to many national treasures, including Stone Lantern at Muryangsujeon Hall of Buseoksa Temple (National Treasure No. 17), Muryangsujeon Hall of Buseoksa Temple (National Treasure No. 18), Josadang Shrine of Buseoksa Temple (National Treasure No. 19), Clay Seated Buddha of Buseoksa Temple (National Treasure No. 45), Mural Painting in Josadang Shrine of Buseoksa Temple (National Treasure No. 46), Stone Seated Buddhas in Bukji-ri (Treasure No. 220), Three-story Stone Pagoda of Buseoksa Temple (Treasure No. 249), Flagpole Supports of Buseoksa Temple (Treasure No. 255), Printing Woodblocks of Buddhist Scriptures in Buseoksa Temple (Treasure 735), and more.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-54-633-3464|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 2,000 won / Teenagers 1,500 won / Children 1,000 won<br>Groups - Adults 1,800 won / Teenagers 1,300 won / Children 800 won<br><br>* Groups: 30 people or more|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Cars 3,000 won <br>Buses 6,000 won<br>* Inquires: +82-54-631-4762|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-29-1659102944914/2654220_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659102944914/2654220_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659102944914/2654221_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659102944914/2654221_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659102944914/2654223_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659102944914/2654223_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659102944914/2654224_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659102944914/2654224_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659102944914/2654225_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659102944914/2654225_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659102944914/2654226_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659102944914/2654226_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659102944914/2654227_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659102944914/2654227_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659102944914/2654228_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659102944914/2654228_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-54-633-3464](tel:+82546333464)\n- [üè†www.pusoksa.org](http://www.pusoksa.org/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.9984792058\nlongitude: 128.6876110241\ntitle: 345, Buseoksa-ro, Yeongju-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Seoul Express Bus Terminal, take a bus to Yeongju Bus Terminal.\n<br>Across from Yeongju Bus Terminal, take Bus No. 27 and get off at Buseoksa Temple Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-29-1659102944914","title":"Buseoksa Temple [UNESCO World Heritage] (Î∂ÄÏÑùÏÇ¨ [Ïú†ÎÑ§Ïä§ÏΩî ÏÑ∏Í≥ÑÎ¨∏ÌôîÏú†ÏÇ∞])","description":"Buseoksa Temple was built in 676, during the reign of King Munmu (661-681) of the Silla Kingdom (57 BC-AD 935).

The city of Goryeong played such a central role in the development of the confederacy that many artifacts and historic sites of the Daegaya period can still be found there today. <br><br>Some of the most prominent landmarks are the 200 gobuns (ancient tombs) that lie along the southeastern slope of Jusan Mountain in Goryeong. In ancient times, the higher and larger a tomb, the higher the social status of the person buried inside. Given this tradition and historical evidence, the largest tomb in the south has been identified as Geumnim Wangneung (Royal Tomb of King Geumnim); the other large tombs are also presumed to be those of the kings of Daegaya. The large royal tombs (over 20m in diameter) dominate the mountain ridge (the highest point) while mid-sized and smaller tombs can be found on the mountain slopes and foothills. <br><br>Historical research on Daegaya began with the excavation and partial identification of the ancient tombs of Goryeong by research teams from Kyungpook National University and Keimyung University in 1977. Excavators discovered a great number of relics‚Äîgilt-bronze crowns, swords, armor, and trinkets of gold, silver, and jade‚Äîthat shed light on the flourishing culture of Gaya. <br><br>To continue to encourage interest in the history and culture of Daegaya, officials of Goryeong-gun County established the Daegaya Royal Tomb Exhibit Hall at the foot of Jusan Mountain in Gobun-gun, Jisan-dong. The exhibition hall depicts the social structure of the era through ancient customs such as burying servants alive with their dead masters.","regDate":"2022-12-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-12-1670820019777/1004711_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-12-1670820019777"},{"id":"2022-12-12-1670816415461","title":"Jikjisa Temple (ÏßÅÏßÄÏÇ¨)","description":"Jikjisa Temple, located at the foot of Hwangaksan Mountain in Gimcheon, Gyeongsangbuk-do, was constructed in 418, during the second year of Silla Kingdom King Nuljis reign.
