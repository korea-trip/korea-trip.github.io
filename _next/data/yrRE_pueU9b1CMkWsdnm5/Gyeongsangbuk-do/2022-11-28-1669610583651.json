Although the main temple hall may seem like an ordinary building with its tile roof and walls, the ceiling and the walls are all part of a cave. Some caves are very small, large enough to allow only one person to sit in, while some are spacious enough to provide room for three to four people. From statues of young monks to old and wise monks, a variety of rock-carved sculptures can be seen placed throughout the caves. The caves are connected by steep stairs carved into the cliff, leading all the way to the top. The Buddha statue situated at the top of the cliff is designated as Treasure No. 581 and is 4 meters in x_height and 2.2 meters in x_width. Unfortunately, this granite statue has gone through deterioration over time and a glass roof is built over the statue to prevent further damage. Golgulsa Temple offers training programs as well as a Templestay program for both domestic travelers and tourists from abroad.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-54-744-1689|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Seonmudo & Traditional cultural performance: 15:30 (Closed Mondays)|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-28-1669610583651/202517_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-28-1669610583651/202517_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-28-1669610583651/202522_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-28-1669610583651/202522_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-28-1669610583651/202527_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-28-1669610583651/202527_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-28-1669610583651/977061_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-28-1669610583651/977061_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-28-1669610583651/977079_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-28-1669610583651/977079_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-28-1669610583651/977091_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-28-1669610583651/977091_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-28-1669610583651/977109_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-28-1669610583651/977109_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-28-1669610583651/202509_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-28-1669610583651/202509_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-28-1669610583651/202525_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-28-1669610583651/202525_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-28-1669610583651/202533_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-28-1669610583651/202533_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-54-744-1689](tel:+82547441689)\n- [üè†www.golgulsa.com</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.templestay.com/temple_info.asp?t_id=d-kumkang \" target=\"_blank\">www.templestay.com](http://www.golgulsa.com/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.8057841422\nlongitude: 129.4091069500\ntitle: 101-5, Girim-ro, Gyeongju-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Taxi]<br>\nApprox. 30 min from Gyeongju Station\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-28-1669610583651","title":"Gyeongju Golgulsa Temple (Í≥®Íµ¥ÏÇ¨ (Í≤ΩÏ£º))","description":"Located at the foot of Hamwolsan Mountain, Golgulsa Temple houses twelve caves in a tall cliff, with a rock-carved statue of Buddha sitting at the highest point.

The city of Goryeong played such a central role in the development of the confederacy that many artifacts and historic sites of the Daegaya period can still be found there today. <br><br>Some of the most prominent landmarks are the 200 gobuns (ancient tombs) that lie along the southeastern slope of Jusan Mountain in Goryeong. In ancient times, the higher and larger a tomb, the higher the social status of the person buried inside. Given this tradition and historical evidence, the largest tomb in the south has been identified as Geumnim Wangneung (Royal Tomb of King Geumnim); the other large tombs are also presumed to be those of the kings of Daegaya. The large royal tombs (over 20m in diameter) dominate the mountain ridge (the highest point) while mid-sized and smaller tombs can be found on the mountain slopes and foothills. <br><br>Historical research on Daegaya began with the excavation and partial identification of the ancient tombs of Goryeong by research teams from Kyungpook National University and Keimyung University in 1977. Excavators discovered a great number of relics‚Äîgilt-bronze crowns, swords, armor, and trinkets of gold, silver, and jade‚Äîthat shed light on the flourishing culture of Gaya. <br><br>To continue to encourage interest in the history and culture of Daegaya, officials of Goryeong-gun County established the Daegaya Royal Tomb Exhibit Hall at the foot of Jusan Mountain in Gobun-gun, Jisan-dong. The exhibition hall depicts the social structure of the era through ancient customs such as burying servants alive with their dead masters.","regDate":"2022-12-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-12-1670820019777/1004711_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-12-1670820019777"},{"id":"2022-12-12-1670816415461","title":"Jikjisa Temple (ÏßÅÏßÄÏÇ¨)","description":"Jikjisa Temple, located at the foot of Hwangaksan Mountain in Gimcheon, Gyeongsangbuk-do, was constructed in 418, during the second year of Silla Kingdom King Nuljis reign.
