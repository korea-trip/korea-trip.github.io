The rocky island, about 200 meters in circumference, is divided by a cross-shaped waterway, forming a pool at the center, at the bottom of which is a granite stone 3.6 meters long, 2.9 meters wide and 0.9 meters thick. Legend has it that the remains of King Munmu’s cremated body are buried under this rock. Historians still debate whether the ashes of the King Munmu were scattered or stored in an urn and placed under the rock.","regDate":"2022-12-07","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-07-1670391364282/1613346_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-07-1670391364282"},{"id":"2022-12-07-1670388081385","title":"The POSCO Museum  (포스코 역사관)","description":"The POSCO Museum shows the history, spirit, corporate culture and vision of POSCO.
