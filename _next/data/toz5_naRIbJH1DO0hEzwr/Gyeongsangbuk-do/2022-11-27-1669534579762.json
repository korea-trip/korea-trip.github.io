It also served as a banquet site for important national events and important visitors. The pond was created in 674, during the reign of King Munmu. The pond features three small islands, and a landscape of 12 small hills to the northeast. After the fall of Silla, the site was abandoned and forgotten. The pond was referred to as Anapji from the Goryeo and Joseon periods and onwards. In the 1980s, a pottery fragment with the letters ‚ÄúWolji‚Äù (a pond that reflects the moon) carved onto it was found, revealing the true name of the pond. After the discovery, the site was renamed to the current Donggung Palace and Wolji Pond.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-54-750-8655, 8650|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|09:00-22:00<br>* Last admission 30 minutes before closing. <br>* Advised to purchase tickets early as site is a famous nighttime attraction.|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 3,000 won / Teenagers 2,000 won / Children 1,000 won <br>Groups - Adults 2,400 won / Teenagers 1,600 won / Children 800 won<BR>* Groups: 30 people or more|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-27-1669534579762/1613358_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-27-1669534579762/1613358_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-27-1669534579762/1613362_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-27-1669534579762/1613362_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-27-1669534579762/2612560_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-27-1669534579762/2612560_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-27-1669534579762/2612562_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-27-1669534579762/2612562_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-54-750-8655](tel:+82547508655)\n- [üè†www.gyeongju.go.kr/tour](http://www.gyeongju.go.kr/tour)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.8352023996\nlongitude: 129.2283747104\ntitle: 102, Wonhwa-ro, Gyeongju-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-27-1669534579762","title":"Gyeongju Donggung Palace and Wolji Pond (Í≤ΩÏ£º ÎèôÍ∂ÅÍ≥º ÏõîÏßÄ)","description":"Gyeongju Donggung Palace and Wolji Pond was a secondary palace used by the crown prince of the Silla Kingdom.

The king gave specific instructions to be buried in the East Sea after his death so that he would become a dragon and protect Silla from foreign invaders. The rocky island, about 200 meters in circumference, is divided by a cross-shaped waterway, forming a pool at the center, at the bottom of which is a granite stone 3.6 meters long, 2.9 meters wide and 0.9 meters thick. Legend has it that the remains of King Munmu‚Äôs cremated body are buried under this rock. Historians still debate whether the ashes of the King Munmu were scattered or stored in an urn and placed under the rock.","regDate":"2022-12-07","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-07-1670391364282/1613346_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-07-1670391364282"},{"id":"2022-12-07-1670388081385","title":"The POSCO Museum  (Ìè¨Ïä§ÏΩî Ïó≠ÏÇ¨Í¥Ä)","description":"The POSCO Museum shows the history, spirit, corporate culture and vision of POSCO.
