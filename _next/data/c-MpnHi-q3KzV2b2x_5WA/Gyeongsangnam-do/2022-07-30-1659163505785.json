{"pageProps":{"content":"![Baenaegol Valley (Î∞∞ÎÇ¥Í≥®)](/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228175_image2_1.webp)\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> Baenaegol Valley is located at the heart of the mountainous region affectionately known as the Yeongnam Alps. The valley derives its name ‚ÄúBaenaegol,‚Äù meaning ‚Äúthe valley of pears,‚Äù from the wild pear trees that grow in large numbers along the valley.<br><br>\n\nThe valley covers nearly 8 kilometers of land between the range connecting Sinbulsan Mountain and Yeongchuksan Mountain and the western range connecting Cheonhwangsan Mountain and Jaeyaksan Mountain in Miryang. It is a popular vacation destination in the summer. Also, many tourists come to drink the water containing acer mono sap, which is known to be produced in this region during the springtime.\n<br><br>\nBaenaegol Valley is just a short distance away from downtown Yangsan. The valley provides an opportunity to enjoy nature away from the hustle and bustle of the city center. The long valley is wedged between highlands, which results in at least two hours less of sunshine than other regions, so it feels cooler in the summer months. Strawberries are also widely grown in the area.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-55-382-4112|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228158_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228158_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228159_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228159_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228163_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228163_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228166_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228166_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228185_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228185_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228187_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228187_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-55-382-4112](tel:+82553824112)\n- [üè†www.yangsan.go.kr](http://www.yangsan.go.kr/tour)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.4564540524\nlongitude: 128.9660138589\ntitle: Wondong-myeon, Yangsan-si, Gyeongsangnam-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-30-1659163505785","title":"Baenaegol Valley (Î∞∞ÎÇ¥Í≥®)","description":"Baenaegol Valley is located at the heart of the mountainous region affectionately known as the Yeongnam Alps.

The glittery surface and towering cliffs create a spectacular backdrop. Clear footprints of dinosaurs that lived during the Cretaceous Period of the Mesozoic Era remain extending over the coast around Sangjogam region, and thus the area was designated Goseong-gun Gosi No. 20. on November 10, 1983. <br>The beach in front of the Youth Center contains shingles worn down by the tide and a precipitous wall of stratified rocks can be seen beyond the wide bedrock of dinosaur footprints. The rocks are named after the table leg-shaped stone caves such as ‚ÄúSsangjok‚Äù or ‚ÄúSsangbal‚Äù. Many oddly shaped rocks inside the caves have their own folktales.<br>According to one tale, fairies from heaven came down to the Sangjokgul Cave to weave clothes out of brocade for the King of Heaven, and bathed in the Seonnyoetang Pond. The shape of a loom and a puddle still exist. Nearby the cave, Chotdaebawi Rock and Byeongpungbawi Rock create scenery beyond description and leisure cruise boats toss up gentle sea waves. Naturally, the park continuously attracts numerous tourists in all seasons. <br>Also, many are drawn to the mysterious dinosaur footprint fossils at Sangjogam. The site is recognized as one of three major dinosaurs sites in the world, along with those in Brazil and Canada. The footprints belong to dinosaurs familiarized by the popular movie, ‚ÄòJurassic Park‚Äô, such as Brontosaurus, Brachiosaurus, Allosaurus and Naranosaurus. It has been designated Natural Monument No. 411, as dinosaur footprints are valuable resources in discovering the uncovered mysteries of life before the appearance of mankind.","regDate":"2022-12-29","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","County Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-29-1672303057153/1611219_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-29-1672303057153"},{"id":"2022-12-29-1672299315401","title":"Samcheonpodaegyo Park (ÏÇºÏ≤úÌè¨ÎåÄÍµêÍ≥µÏõê)","description":"Samcheonpodaegyo Park is located near the landmark of Namhae, Samcheonpodaegyo Bridge, which connects Sacheon-si to nearby island.","regDate":"2022-12-29","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Architectural Sights","Bridges"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-29-1672299315401"},{"id":"2022-12-29-1672295914657","title":"Okpo Shipyard of Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (ÎåÄÏö∞Ï°∞ÏÑ†Ìï¥Ïñë(Ï£º) Ïò•Ìè¨Ï°∞ÏÑ†ÏÜå)","description":"Okpo Shipyard of Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering spans over a 4000,000„é° land and consists of large-scale specialized facilities and equipments for shipbuilding and repairs such as a dock that can handle a 1,000,000 ton vessel and a 900 ton Goliath crane.
