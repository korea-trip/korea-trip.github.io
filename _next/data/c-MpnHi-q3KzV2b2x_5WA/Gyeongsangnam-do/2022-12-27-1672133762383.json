The footprints are deeply imprinted in the wide sheets of rocks arrayed along Dongdaeman Beach. Researchers believe that these enormous footprints belong to a species of huge pterosaur, and visitors can see about 60 smaller footprints that are believed to belong to early humans. The dinosaur footprints and other cretaceous fossils are located along the cape by the shore, so you must time your visit well to see them. According to paleontologists, the footprints are the evidence of three specimens of herbivorous  sauropoda, which walked on two 60 centimeter-long feet; two specimens of ornithopoda, which were also herbivores, that had three toes on each foot; and one specimen of another ornithopod species, a carnivore that had sharp claws and walked on two feet. The layout of the footprints alludes to a situation where the herbivores were walking in a group followed by a carnivore preparing for an attack! <br><br>\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-55-860-8636,<br> +82-1588-3415|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-27-1672133762383/212944_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-27-1672133762383/212944_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-27-1672133762383/212945_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-27-1672133762383/212945_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-55-860-8636, +82-1588-3415](tel:+82558608636, +8215883415)\n- [üè†eng.namhae.go.kr/main/](http://eng.namhae.go.kr/main/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 34.8862959385\nlongitude: 128.0493036980\ntitle: Gain-ri, Changseonyeon, Namhae-gun, Gyeongsanam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \nFrom Seoul Nambu Bus Terminal, take an intercity bus to Namhae (ÎÇ®Ìï¥).<br>* \nBus schedule: 07:00-19:30, 11 buses a day (Subject to change)<br>From Namhae \nBus Terminal, take a Namhae TR-Gain (ÎÇ®Ìï¥TR-Í∞ÄÏù∏) route or Namhae TR-Yeongok (ÎÇ®Ìï¥TR-Ïó∞Í≥°) route bus to Gain (Í∞ÄÏù∏).<br>Go \n400m towards Godu (Í≥†Îëê).<br>Turn right at the sign for the Dinosaurian Footprints \n(Í≥µÎ£°Î∞úÏûêÍµ≠).<br>Go 500m forward to arrive at Fossilized Dinosaur Footprint \nSite.\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-27-1672133762383","title":"Fossilized Dinosaur Footprint Site Gain-ri, Namhae (ÎÇ®Ìï¥ Í∞ÄÏù∏Î¶¨ ÌôîÏÑùÏÇ∞ÏßÄ)","description":"<br>Gain-ri village in Changseon-myeon, Namhae, Gyeongnam Province, has a primitive fossil site that includes 34 footprints of pterosaurs, or flying dinosaurs.

The glittery surface and towering cliffs create a spectacular backdrop. Clear footprints of dinosaurs that lived during the Cretaceous Period of the Mesozoic Era remain extending over the coast around Sangjogam region, and thus the area was designated Goseong-gun Gosi No. 20. on November 10, 1983. <br>The beach in front of the Youth Center contains shingles worn down by the tide and a precipitous wall of stratified rocks can be seen beyond the wide bedrock of dinosaur footprints. The rocks are named after the table leg-shaped stone caves such as ‚ÄúSsangjok‚Äù or ‚ÄúSsangbal‚Äù. Many oddly shaped rocks inside the caves have their own folktales.<br>According to one tale, fairies from heaven came down to the Sangjokgul Cave to weave clothes out of brocade for the King of Heaven, and bathed in the Seonnyoetang Pond. The shape of a loom and a puddle still exist. Nearby the cave, Chotdaebawi Rock and Byeongpungbawi Rock create scenery beyond description and leisure cruise boats toss up gentle sea waves. Naturally, the park continuously attracts numerous tourists in all seasons. <br>Also, many are drawn to the mysterious dinosaur footprint fossils at Sangjogam. The site is recognized as one of three major dinosaurs sites in the world, along with those in Brazil and Canada. The footprints belong to dinosaurs familiarized by the popular movie, ‚ÄòJurassic Park‚Äô, such as Brontosaurus, Brachiosaurus, Allosaurus and Naranosaurus. It has been designated Natural Monument No. 411, as dinosaur footprints are valuable resources in discovering the uncovered mysteries of life before the appearance of mankind.","regDate":"2022-12-29","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","County Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-29-1672303057153/1611219_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-29-1672303057153"},{"id":"2022-12-29-1672299315401","title":"Samcheonpodaegyo Park (ÏÇºÏ≤úÌè¨ÎåÄÍµêÍ≥µÏõê)","description":"Samcheonpodaegyo Park is located near the landmark of Namhae, Samcheonpodaegyo Bridge, which connects Sacheon-si to nearby island.","regDate":"2022-12-29","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Architectural Sights","Bridges"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-29-1672299315401"},{"id":"2022-12-29-1672295914657","title":"Okpo Shipyard of Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (ÎåÄÏö∞Ï°∞ÏÑ†Ìï¥Ïñë(Ï£º) Ïò•Ìè¨Ï°∞ÏÑ†ÏÜå)","description":"Okpo Shipyard of Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering spans over a 4000,000„é° land and consists of large-scale specialized facilities and equipments for shipbuilding and repairs such as a dock that can handle a 1,000,000 ton vessel and a 900 ton Goliath crane.
