Depending on the day and the tide, it may appear to be five islands or six islands, hence the name ('o' meaning five and 'yuk' meaning six in Korean). The islands are full of cliffs, caves and free-roaming animals and plants. The islands were intact to the mainland approximately 120,000 years ago, but due to continuous wave erosion, island were separated.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-51-888-3636, <BR>+82-51-607-6395|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Tour Course Information:|[Half-day course]<br>Igidae Costal Path - Oryukdo Island - Baengunpo - Sinseondae<br><br>[One-day course]<br>Igidae - Jangjasan Mountain - Oryukdo Island - Baengunpo - Sinseondae - Hwangryeongsan Mountain|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-17-1660779464381/2597454_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-17-1660779464381/2597454_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-17-1660779464381/2616903_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-17-1660779464381/2616903_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-17-1660779464381/2616904_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-17-1660779464381/2616904_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-17-1660779464381/2616905_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-17-1660779464381/2616905_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-17-1660779464381/2616907_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-17-1660779464381/2616907_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-17-1660779464381/2654785_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-17-1660779464381/2654785_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-17-1660779464381/2654786_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-17-1660779464381/2654786_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-51-888-3636](tel:+82518883636)\n- [üè†www.busan.go.kr/geopark](http://www.busan.go.kr/geopark/index)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.1014773335\nlongitude: 129.1231321559\ntitle: 137, Oryukdo-ro, Nam-gu, Busan\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-17-1660779464381","title":"Oryukdo Island [National Geopark] (Ïò§Î•ôÎèÑ (Î∂ÄÏÇ∞ Íµ≠Í∞ÄÏßÄÏßàÍ≥µÏõê))","description":"Oryukdo Island refers to a group of rocky islands off the southern coast of Busan.
