The temple features Muryangsujeon Hall, Samseonggak Hall, and Yosachae (monks’ residence).   <br><br>There used to be a building with a tile roof, but following the discovery of a stele with the inscription of “Muin Year” and a pedestal (Treasure No. 649), the roof was improved. The side of the stele is in a trapezoid shape with a wider bottom. It is thought to date back to the Unified Silla era. The temple is also home to a stele with seven relief Buddhist images (Treasure No. 650). Together with the stone images of Biamsa and Jeonganmyeon, this stele is considered to have cast a new light on the Ancient Art.","regDate":"2022-07-18","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Sejong","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Sejong/2022-07-18-1658097582341"},{"id":"2022-07-17-1658062864404","title":"Sejong Singwangsa Temple (신광사 (세종))","description":"Singwangsa Temple is located on Nojeoksan Mountain.
