In memory of these soldiers, Emperor Gojong built the Jangchungdan Shrine in November 1900 at the current site of the Shilla Hotel guesthouse. The shrine was lost during the Korean War and the area was renovated into a park in 1919.<br><br>On September 22, 1984, Jangchungdan Park was designated the 374th neighborhood park of Korea and part of the park was merged with Namsan Park. The remaining area retained the name “Jangchungdan Park” and is still home to cultural assets such as the Jangchungdan Memorial Stone, Supyogyo, Seungjeongjeon, Gwanseongmyo, and Waryongmyo. The park is considered a landmark of patriotism since it contains the 1919 Independence Movement of Korea Memorial Stone and other monuments dedicated to people such as Han Yong-un, Yu Gwan-sun, and Gim Yong-hwan who fought for the independence of Korea.","regDate":"2022-08-04","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-04-1659623660561/1945785_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-08-04-1659623660561"},{"id":"2022-08-04-1659621118461","title":"Jangchung-dong Jokbal Street (장충동 족발 골목)","description":"The phenomenon of Jangchungdong Jokbal Street started 50 years ago with the opening of two Korean jokbal (steamed pig trotters) restaurants, followed by the influx of new jokbal restaurants during the late 70s and early 80s. <br>Today, the jokbal restaurants continue to serve one of the most sought Korean food from the main road and the alleyways of the Jangchungdong 1(il)-ga Street area.","regDate":"2022-08-04","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Experience Programs","Cultural Districts"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-04-1659621118461/696569_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-08-04-1659621118461"},{"id":"2022-08-04-1659618367261","title":"Jamsil Special Tourist Zone (잠실 관광특구)","description":"Jamsil Special Tourist Zone includes Lotte World, Lotte World Tower, along with various amusement facilities, shopping malls, and historic sites in the nearby area.

Many people enjoy hiking the path that begins at Sajik Tunnel, which leads to the peak of the mountain passing the fortress walls, then hike back down to Buam-dong. The hiking course is also connected to the road in front of Cheongwadae, so hikers can also walk along the historical Palpan-ro road, Hyoja-ro road, and Gyeongbokgung Palace. The hiking path located behind Sajik Park leads to Hwanghakjeong Pavilion, where archers during the Joseon dynasty once honed their marksmanship. The Hwanghakjeong Pavilion was originally located within the Gyeonghuigung Palace, but was relocated to the mountain. From the top, a panoramic view of the surrounding area spreads as far as Inwangsan Mountain, Naksan Mountain, Namsan Mountain, and Baegaksan Mountain with Gyeongbokgung Palace at its center.<br><br>The hiking path past Sajik Park's T-intersection is a popular walking course to nearby office workers during lunch time. A view of Cheongwadae is visible from atop Beombawi Rock (tiger's rock). For hikers seeking to walk along the ridges, it is recommended to take the path down to Hongje-dong quarry or Jahamun Gate. Hikers are recommended to take their time to fully enjoy the view of the surroundings while walking along the path of the outer walls. The stone stairway following the path past Changuimun Gate will take hikers to the path along the outer walls. This path stretches for approximately 200 meters and a set of stones used to build the city walls during the reign of King Taejo, King Sejong, and King Sukjung still remain along the way. The thick, dark-colored mosses on the stones indicate the long history of Seoul.<br><br>The view of the refreshing landscape and Inwangsan Mountain's peak will greet the hikers once they walk back to the inner city walls through a step of stones. Hikers will be able to get a bird's-eye-view of Seoul's mountains and skyscrapers surrounding the Hangang River. The city walls along the path going down to Cheongun-dong still withhold their beauty from the past.<br><br>Inwangsan Mountain stands at a x_height of 338.2 meters and spreads throughout the regions of Hongje-dong in Seodaemun-gu and Muak-dong, Nusang-dong, Ogin-dong and Buam-dong in Jongno-gu. The unique and colossal rock formations and the view of Seoul and Cheongwadae are only a few of the many charms of Inwangsan Mountain.","regDate":"2022-08-04","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-04-1659605785634/1894462_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-08-04-1659605785634"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
