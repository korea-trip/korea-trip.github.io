The purpose of the temple site was to pray for help and guidance from Buddha against Japanese invasion. Unfortunately, King Munmu passed away before the completion of the temple, and left a will to be cremated and buried in the East Sea so that he may reincarnate as a sea dragon in order to protect the country. As he wished, King Munmus ashes were scattered at Daewangam of the East Sea. The temple was completed and was named by his son, King Sinmun (AD 681-692) in respect and appreciation for his father. <br>Gameunsaji Temple Site was rebuilt in 1979 based on the discovery of the sites foundation after two years of archeological research. The three-story stone pagoda at the temple site is a reminent of the early period of unified Silla, assembled with several parts which rise up to 13.4m high, known to be Sillas highest three-story pagoda.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-54-772-3843|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Not available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-24-1669272162384/530275_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-24-1669272162384/530275_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-24-1669272162384/680942_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-24-1669272162384/680942_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-24-1669272162384/680958_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-24-1669272162384/680958_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-24-1669272162384/1031336_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-24-1669272162384/1031336_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-24-1669272162384/1200461_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-24-1669272162384/1200461_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-24-1669272162384/1200462_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-24-1669272162384/1200462_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-24-1669272162384/1200465_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-24-1669272162384/1200465_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-24-1669272162384/1613352_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-24-1669272162384/1613352_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-24-1669272162384/1613354_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-24-1669272162384/1613354_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-24-1669272162384/530276_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-24-1669272162384/530276_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-54-772-3843](tel:+82547723843)\n- [üè†www.gyeongju.go.kr/tour](http://www.gyeongju.go.kr/tour)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.7482196956\nlongitude: 129.4768554542\ntitle: Yongdang-ri, Gyeonju-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Gyeongju Intercity Bus Terminal, take city Bus No. 150 and get off at Gameunsa Temple Site Bus Stop.<br>\nWalk for approx. 3 min.\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-24-1669272162384","title":"Gameunsaji Temple Site (Í≤ΩÏ£º Í∞êÏùÄÏÇ¨ÏßÄ)","description":"Gameunsaji Temple Site was built by King Munmu (AD 661-681), the king of Silla who unified Baekje and Goguryeo in the late 7th century.

The mandorla (Buddhist halo of light), which consists of both the dugwang (light radiating from the head) and hte singwang (light emanating from the Buddha‚Äôs body), is also the shrine for the statue, so the image of the Bodhisattva looks more prominent.

A painting of the caving titled Golgulseokgul by Gyeomjae Jeongseon, a famous painter of the era, revealed that there was once a wooden room located in front of the Maebul, but today only a hint of the room remains on the rock. The head of the Buddha (Yukgye) is perched solid and high on the body with a clear profile of the face ‚Äì sharp eyes, small lips and a long and narrow nose. In contrast to the three-dimensional face, the body is broader and flatter. The neck and upper chest sections have eroded over time. The folds in the clothing are nearly parallel, and the arm area has a v-pattern wrinkle, giving it a more realistic and three-dimensional quality. Around the head of the Buddha is a lotus-shaped halo, while the body is surrounded by a rhythmic flame-like halo. The Maebul is believed to have been created during the late Unified Silla Kingdom, as it shows similar craftsmanship to Seated Stone Vairocana Buddha (National Treasure No. 995), which was created in the year 876 and is located in Chukseosa Temple.","regDate":"2022-12-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-13-1670924193942"},{"id":"2022-12-13-1670920819064","title":"Sail Spa Land (ÏÇ¨ÏùºÏò®Ï≤ú)","description":"Sail Spa Land is uniquely located at the top of a mountain.
