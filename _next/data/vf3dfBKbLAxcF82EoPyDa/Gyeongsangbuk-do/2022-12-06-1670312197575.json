The peak is so broad that 50 adults can sit on it at the same time. Among the rocks there is Seokcheon Pond, which never dries up. The peak used to be called ‚ÄúUnjangdae‚Äù because the summit is always covered with clouds and mist. Legend says that King Sejo of Joseon dynasty supposedly recited a poem on the summit. <br> <br> Munjangdae has a great view of Cheonhwangbong Peak, the highest peak of Songnisan Mountain. Visitors can also see Gwaneumbong, Chilseongbong, Sirubong, Tugubong, Munsubong, and Birobong peaks. In autumn, visitors can enjoy views of breathtaking fall foliage along the trail, which begins at Hwabuk-myeon, Sangju. There are also many cultural heritage sites including Janggakpokpo Falls, Seongbuksa Temple, Osongpokpo Falls and Gyeonhwonsanseong Fortress.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-43-542-5267,<br>+82-54-533-3389|\n|parking:|Available (Osong parking lot)|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restricted Mountain Areas :|[hiking.kworks.co.kr](http://hiking.kworks.co.kr/sub_map/map_user01.aspx)|\n|Areas Open to the Public:|Beopju Ticket office - Sesimjeong -  Sinseondae (6.1 km)<br> Osong area - Munjangdae (3.5 km) <br> Sesimjeong - Dohwa-ri (8.5 km) <br> Janggakdong - Cheonwangbong Peak - Munjangdae (6.5 km) <br> Sadam-ri - Nagyeongsan Mountain - Domyeongsan Mountain (6.5 km) <br> Haksodae - Cheomseongdae (6 km) <br> Sesimjeong - Munjangdae (3.3 km)<br> Cheonwangbong Peak - Hyeongjebong Peak (7.1 km)<br> Sogeumgang River - Gunjasan Mountain - Domagol Valley (6.5 km) <br> Tteokbawi Rock - Chilbosan Mountain - Ssanggokpokpo Falls (6.2 km) <br> Jeolmal - Ssanggokpokpo Falls - Jangseongbong Peak - Jesurijae (12 km) <br> Birosanjang Cottage - Sanggoam (1.2 km) <br> Seonnyubong Peak - Jebiso (1.8 km) <br> Hyeongjebong Peak - Mansu-ri (2.5 km) <br> Ungyo-ri - Gallon (2.8 km)|\n|Mountain Not Access Period:|- Walking Trails Closure<br>Spring: March 2 - April 30<br>Autumn: November 15 - December 15<br><br>* TBD by park directors based on fire weather advisories, snow/precipitation levels, and other local conditions.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Hwabuk Tourist Information Center, Hwabuk Park Office|\n|Parking Fees:|Small cars: 2,000 won<br>Mid-sized cars: 4,000~5,000 won<br>Buses: 6,000~7,500 won|\n|Admission Fees:|Beopjusa Temple admission fee|\n  \n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-43-542-5267](tel:+82435425267)\n- [üè†songni.knps.or.kr](http://songni.knps.or.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.5939740089\nlongitude: 127.8569080064\ntitle: Hwabuk-myeon, Sangju-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \nFrom Dong \nSeoul Bus Terminal, take an intercity bus to Songnisan Mt.

The mandorla (Buddhist halo of light), which consists of both the dugwang (light radiating from the head) and hte singwang (light emanating from the Buddha‚Äôs body), is also the shrine for the statue, so the image of the Bodhisattva looks more prominent.

A painting of the caving titled Golgulseokgul by Gyeomjae Jeongseon, a famous painter of the era, revealed that there was once a wooden room located in front of the Maebul, but today only a hint of the room remains on the rock. The head of the Buddha (Yukgye) is perched solid and high on the body with a clear profile of the face ‚Äì sharp eyes, small lips and a long and narrow nose. In contrast to the three-dimensional face, the body is broader and flatter. The neck and upper chest sections have eroded over time. The folds in the clothing are nearly parallel, and the arm area has a v-pattern wrinkle, giving it a more realistic and three-dimensional quality. Around the head of the Buddha is a lotus-shaped halo, while the body is surrounded by a rhythmic flame-like halo. The Maebul is believed to have been created during the late Unified Silla Kingdom, as it shows similar craftsmanship to Seated Stone Vairocana Buddha (National Treasure No. 995), which was created in the year 876 and is located in Chukseosa Temple.","regDate":"2022-12-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-13-1670924193942"},{"id":"2022-12-13-1670920819064","title":"Sail Spa Land (ÏÇ¨ÏùºÏò®Ï≤ú)","description":"Sail Spa Land is uniquely located at the top of a mountain.
