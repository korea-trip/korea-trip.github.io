The city of Goryeong played such a central role in the development of the confederacy that many artifacts and historic sites of the Daegaya period can still be found there today. <br><br>Some of the most prominent landmarks are the 200 gobuns (ancient tombs) that lie along the southeastern slope of Jusan Mountain in Goryeong. In ancient times, the higher and larger a tomb, the higher the social status of the person buried inside. Given this tradition and historical evidence, the largest tomb in the south has been identified as Geumnim Wangneung (Royal Tomb of King Geumnim); the other large tombs are also presumed to be those of the kings of Daegaya. The large royal tombs (over 20m in diameter) dominate the mountain ridge (the highest point) while mid-sized and smaller tombs can be found on the mountain slopes and foothills. <br><br>Historical research on Daegaya began with the excavation and partial identification of the ancient tombs of Goryeong by research teams from Kyungpook National University and Keimyung University in 1977. Excavators discovered a great number of relics—gilt-bronze crowns, swords, armor, and trinkets of gold, silver, and jade—that shed light on the flourishing culture of Gaya. <br><br>To continue to encourage interest in the history and culture of Daegaya, officials of Goryeong-gun County established the Daegaya Royal Tomb Exhibit Hall at the foot of Jusan Mountain in Gobun-gun, Jisan-dong. The exhibition hall depicts the social structure of the era through ancient customs such as burying servants alive with their dead masters.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-54-950-6363|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-12-1670820019777/1004711_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-12-1670820019777/1004711_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-12-1670820019777/1004725_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-12-1670820019777/1004725_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-12-1670820019777/1004735_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-12-1670820019777/1004735_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-12-1670820019777/1004915_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-12-1670820019777/1004915_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-12-1670820019777/1005018_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-12-1670820019777/1005018_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-12-1670820019777/1005065_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-12-1670820019777/1005065_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-12-1670820019777/1005102_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-12-1670820019777/1005102_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-12-1670820019777/2024013_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-12-1670820019777/2024013_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-12-1670820019777/2024014_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-12-1670820019777/2024014_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-12-1670820019777/1004772_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-12-1670820019777/1004772_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-54-950-6363](tel:+82549506363)\n- [🏠tour.goryeong.go.kr</a> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br><a href=\"http://www.cha.go.kr/\" target=\"_blank\">www.cha.go.kr](http://tour.goryeong.go.kr/kor/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.7250940382\nlongitude: 128.2543717249\ntitle: San 23-1, Jisan-ri, Goryeong-eup, Goryeong-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>\nFrom Seoul \nNambu Bus Terminal, take an intercity bus to Goryeong Intercity Bus Terminal. \n<br>From Goryeong Intercity Bus Terminal, take a taxi for approx. 10 min. to Jisandong Ancient Tombs.\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-12-1670820019777","title":"Jisandong Ancient Tombs (고령 지산동 고분군)","description":"Goryeong was the old capital of Daegaya (42-562 AD), a city-state of the Gaya confederacy that once spanned the region now occupied by Gyeongsangnam-do Province to the south of the Korean peninsula.

He looks as if he is sitting on a cloud, while the closed eyes on the plump face give the impression that he is lost in deep thought. He seems to be watching mankind from his world above the clouds. He is holding a flower in his right hand and his left hand is held up to his chest as if he is preaching.<br><br>His robe is very thin, revealing the curves of the body, and hangs down to the base of the pedestal. The mandorla (Buddhist halo of light), which consists of both the dugwang (light radiating from the head) and hte singwang (light emanating from the Buddha’s body), is also the shrine for the statue, so the image of the Bodhisattva looks more prominent. It is presumed that this rock-carved Bodhisattva was made during the late eighth century during the Unified Silla dynasty.","regDate":"2022-12-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-13-1670927944965"},{"id":"2022-12-13-1670924193942","title":"Seated Rock-carved Buddha at Golgulam Temple (경주 골굴암 마애여래좌상)","description":"The Seated Rock-carved Buddha at Golgulam Temple consists of a Maebul (a Buddha carved in a cliff) at the very top of 12 Buddha images carved in natural rock caves located in a steep cliff of Girimsa Valley. A painting of the caving titled Golgulseokgul by Gyeomjae Jeongseon, a famous painter of the era, revealed that there was once a wooden room located in front of the Maebul, but today only a hint of the room remains on the rock. The head of the Buddha (Yukgye) is perched solid and high on the body with a clear profile of the face – sharp eyes, small lips and a long and narrow nose. In contrast to the three-dimensional face, the body is broader and flatter. The neck and upper chest sections have eroded over time. The folds in the clothing are nearly parallel, and the arm area has a v-pattern wrinkle, giving it a more realistic and three-dimensional quality. Around the head of the Buddha is a lotus-shaped halo, while the body is surrounded by a rhythmic flame-like halo. The Maebul is believed to have been created during the late Unified Silla Kingdom, as it shows similar craftsmanship to Seated Stone Vairocana Buddha (National Treasure No. 995), which was created in the year 876 and is located in Chukseosa Temple.","regDate":"2022-12-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-13-1670924193942"},{"id":"2022-12-13-1670920819064","title":"Sail Spa Land (사일온천)","description":"Sail Spa Land is uniquely located at the top of a mountain.
