In 1846, the Nongae-saeng-jang-hyang-su-myeong-bi monument was put up in praise of Nongae’s patriotism. In 1955, a shrine was built and named Uiamsa, which was then moved to the current location in 1974. Within the precincts of the shrine are a memorial stone, the portrait of Nongae by artist Kim Eun-ho, and three gates Woesammun, Naesammun and Chunguimun erected one after another. At the memorial hall, the existing possessions of Nongae and her husband General Choi Gyeong-hoe are on display. The annual Nongae Festival takes places on September 3rd by the lunar calendar, during which memorial services and cultural events are held to commemorate Nongae.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-63-350-2326|\n|parking:|Available|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00 (Winter 09:00-17:00)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Memorial Hall, monument house, etc.|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798134_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798134_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798184_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798184_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798188_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798188_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798191_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798191_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798200_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798200_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798210_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798210_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798223_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798223_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798227_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798227_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798239_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798239_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798162_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798162_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-63-350-2326](tel:+82633502326)\n- [🏠www.cha.go.kr](http://www.cha.go.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.6411181919\nlongitude: 127.5180751461\ntitle: 393, Hannuri-ro, Jangsu-gun, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>From Jangsu Intercity Bus Terminal, walk for approx. 10 min.\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-08-1673148955286","title":"Nongae Shrine (Uiamsa Shrine) (논개사당(의암사))","description":"Uiamsa Shrine was built to the memory of Chu Nongae, who sacrificed her life during the Imjin War (Japanese Invasion of Korea).
