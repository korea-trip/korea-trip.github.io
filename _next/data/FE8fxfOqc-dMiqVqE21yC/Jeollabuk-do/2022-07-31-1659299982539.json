The lake and its surrounding mountains were designated a national tourist site in 1985, but remain historically significant as they are featured on Daedongyeojido (Grand Map of Korea), a revered document developed by geographer Kim Jeong-ho. Known for its beauty at night, the lake was befittingly dubbed “Eunpa,” which means “silvery moonlit waves.”<br><br>\n\nEupa Lake Park is full of natural beauty. The road that runs up from the park entrance is lined with cherry trees that create a breathtaking tunnel of pink flowers each spring. This stunning cherry blossom tunnel draws crowds of families and couples each year, particularly on the weekends. Mulbit Bridge, a landmark of the Eunpa tourist site, offers an impressive view of the Music Fountain and nightscape. At the park, you’ll also find an inline skating area, a waterfront stage, and a lotus flower garden.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-63-454-4896|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Available Facilities:|Outdoor stage, waterside stage, sports field, lotus flower deck, inline skating rinks, duck boat, music fountain, Mulbit Bridge, bike path, etc.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603759_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603759_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603761_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603761_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603762_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603762_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603764_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603764_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603765_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603765_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603766_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603766_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603767_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603767_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603768_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603768_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603769_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603769_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659299982539/176732_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659299982539/176732_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-63-454-4896](tel:+82634544896)\n- [🏠tour.gunsan.go.kr](http://tour.gunsan.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.9509492296\nlongitude: 126.6933626781\ntitle: Miryong-dong, Gunsan-si, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>From \nFrom Gunsan Intercity/Express Bus Terminal Bus Stop, take Bus No. 31, 32, 33, 34 or 38 and get \noff at Gungjeon Wedding Hall (Eunpa Recreation Area) Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-31-1659299982539","title":"Eunpa Lake Park (Eunpa Recreation Area) (은파호수공원(은파국민관광지))","description":"Located in Gunsan, Jeollabuk-do, Eunpa Lake Park was once a reservoir built before the Joseon dynasty that supplied water to nearby farms.

They are originally enshrined in Gyeonggijeon Shrine and Jogyeongmyo Shrine, and when Jeonju had fallen during the Donghak Peasant Revolution, the portrait and tablet were moved to a small palace inside the fortress. The original fortress walls were 16 kilometers in circumference with three gates in the north, east, and west, but only a half-moon shaped western gate remains standing today.","regDate":"2023-01-11","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Nature","Natural Sites","County Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-11-1673415344453/1606418_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-11-1673415344453"},{"id":"2023-01-11-1673411996622","title":"Wibongsa Temple - Wanju (위봉사 (완주))","description":"Wibongsa Temple is located past Mujigaemun Gate (Rainbow Gate) and Wibong Village and is a major temple in the Honam region that once oversaw 52 branch temples.
