The hike up to Donggosa Temple is a refreshing climb, and the temple provides a stunning panoramic view of downtown Jeonju. The temple buildings were constructed one after another along the mountain ridge, and stand in a row on either side of Daeungjeon Hall. The temple is modest and tastefully decorated with portraits of deceased great Buddhist monks and wooden Buddhist murals. The hiking trail to the right of Donggosa Temple leads to Chimyeongjasan Martyrs Ground, which is the graveyard of persecuted Catholics from the late Joseon dynasty.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-63-288-1626|\n|restdate:|N/A (open all year round)|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-04-1672821551267/1605496_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-04-1672821551267/1605496_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-04-1672821551267/1605497_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-04-1672821551267/1605497_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-04-1672821551267/1605499_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-04-1672821551267/1605499_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-04-1672821551267/1605500_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-04-1672821551267/1605500_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-04-1672821551267/1605501_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-04-1672821551267/1605501_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-04-1672821551267/1605502_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-04-1672821551267/1605502_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-63-288-1626](tel:+82632881626)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.8095957238\nlongitude: 127.1677212648\ntitle: 103-100, Naksujeong 2-gil, Wansan-gu, Jeonju-si, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-04-1672821551267","title":"Jeonju Donggosa Temple (동고사 (전주))","description":"Donggosa Temple, located on Seungamsan Mountain in Jeonju, is a Buddhist temple of the Taego Order.
