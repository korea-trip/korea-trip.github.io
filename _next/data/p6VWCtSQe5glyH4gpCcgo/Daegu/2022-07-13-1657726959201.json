{"pageProps":{"content":"![Daegu Gyesan Catholic Church (대구 계산동성당)](/2022-07-13-1657726959201/2642032_image2_1.webp)\n  \n## Overview\n\n> The Daegu Gyesan Catholic Church was built by Father Robert, A.P. (1853-1922), who came to Daegu for missionary work. In 1899, the church building was constructed with wood using a Korean-style design, but was destroyed by fire a few months after construction began. Father Robert created a new building design and imported stained glass and galvanized iron from France and Hong Kong, since these types of building materials were hard to find in Korea. Construction was finally completed in 1902, three years after the project first started.\n<br><br>\nThis church is the only remaining structure in Daegu from the early 1900s. The church building is designed in the shape of a Latin cross, consisting of a nave and transept. This predominantly Romanesque church also features some Gothic architectural elements such as the stained-glass windows and pinnacles.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<BR> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-53-254-2300|\n|parking:|Available|\n|usetime:|[Mass schedule] <br>Saturday - Special mass 16:00, 19:30 / Regular mass 06:30<br>Sundays - 06:30, 08:00, 09:30, 11:00, 17:00, 18:30, 20:00, 21:30<br>Mondays - 06:30<br>Tuesday-Friday 0:30, 11:30, 19:30|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-13-1657726959201/1026129_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-13-1657726959201/1026129_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-13-1657726959201/1763762_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-13-1657726959201/1763762_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-13-1657726959201/2050629_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-13-1657726959201/2050629_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-13-1657726959201/2050633_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-13-1657726959201/2050633_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-13-1657726959201/2050634_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-13-1657726959201/2050634_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-13-1657726959201/2050635_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-13-1657726959201/2050635_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-13-1657726959201/2050636_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-13-1657726959201/2050636_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-53-254-2300](tel:+82532542300)\n- [🏠www.kyesan.org](http://www.kyesan.org/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.8679756281\nlongitude: 128.5877689624\ntitle: 10, Seoseong-ro, Jung-gu, Daegu\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway]<BR>\nBanwoldang Station (Daegu Subway Line 1 or 2), Exit 18.<br>\nGo straight about 300 m and turn right at the Gyesan 5-way Intersection.<br>\nGo straight for approx. 170 m to arrive at the Daegu Gyesan Catholic Church on the right.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-13-1657726959201","title":"Daegu Gyesan Catholic Church (대구 계산동성당)","description":"The Daegu Gyesan Catholic Church was built by Father Robert, A.P.

It was during the time of Mun Gyeong-ho (1812-1874), the 18th descendant of Mun Ik-jeom, that the clan became established in Inheung. Mun executed his plan to create a village for the clan by putting down roots in the old site of Inheungsa Temple, a large-scale temple in the Goryeo era. <br><br>Yonghojae, which is a place for offering ancestral memorial services, is the first building established at the village constructed before or after 1920. The first residential building was built around the late 1800s in the form of thatched cottage. During the course of a hundred years, the village developed into what it is today. Featuring about 70 or so tile-roofed homes, Inheung Village is only about 200 years old but it is a great example of traditional residential homes of the em>yangban</em> upper class in the Yeongnam region. The harmony between the way the village is organized and the surrounding landscape is unique and rare.","regDate":"2022-08-15","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Daegu","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Folk Villages"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-15-1660549026542/1574148_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Daegu/2022-08-15-1660549026542"},{"id":"2022-08-15-1660546126115","title":"House of Yi Sang-hwa (이상화 고택)","description":"Yi Sang-hwa was a nationalist poet, who resisted the Japanese colonialism.
