The three gates of Juheulgwan, Jogokgwan, and Joryeonggwan were built for national defence after the Imjin War (1592-1598). These three gates are designated collectively as Historic Site No. 147. The area between the three gates was designated a provincial park in 1981. The path from the first gate to the last passes through beautiful forests and takes roughly four hours round-trip. Also located within the park boundaries is Mungyeongsaejae Open Set, used for filming historical dramas.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-54-571-0709|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|January 1, the day of Seollal (Lunar New Year's Day) & Chuseok (Korean Thanksgiving Day)|\n|usetime:|Open 24 hr|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Facility Utilization Fees:|[Trolley]<br>One-way: Adults 1,000 won / Teenagers 800 won / Children 500 won<br><br>* Adults (ages 19-64) / Teenagers (ages 13-18) / Children (ages 4-12)<br>* Free admission for children ages 3 & younger and their guardian (1 person)|\n|Available Facilities:|Mungyeongsaejae Open Set, Mungyeongsaejae Ecological Center, Old Trail Museum, sledding hill, etc.|\n|Parking Fees:|Compact vehicles 1,000 won / Sedan 2,000 won /  Buses (25  seats): 4,000 won|\n|Admission Fees:|[Mungyeongsaejae Provincial Park]<br>Free<br><br>[Mungyeongsaejae Open Set]<br> Individuals: Adults 2,000 won / Teenagers 1,000 won  / Children 500 won<br> Groups: Adults 1,500 won / Teenagers 800 won / Children 400  won <br> <br> [Old Trail Museum]<br> Individuals: Adults 1,000  won / Teenagers & Children 700<br> Groups: Adults 800 won / Teenagers & Children 500 won<br><br>[Mungyeongsaejae Ecological Center]<br> Individuals: Adults 2,000  won / Teenagers & Children 1,500<br> Groups: Adults 1,500 won / Teenagers & Children 1,000 won<br><br>[Mungyeongsaejae Eco Maze Park]<br>Adults 3,000 won / Teenagers 2,000 won / Children 1,500 won<br><br>* Adults (ages 19-64) / Teenagers (ages 13-18) / Children (ages 7-12)<br>* Groups: 20 people or more|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-03-1670052938039/2005737_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-03-1670052938039/2005737_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-54-571-0709](tel:+82545710709)\n- [🏠www.gbmg.go.kr](https://www.gbmg.go.kr/tour/contents.do?mId=0101010100)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.7616532703\nlongitude: 128.0770030316\ntitle: 932, Saejae-ro, Mungyeong-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-03-1670052938039","title":"Mungyeongsaejae Provincial Park (문경새재도립공원)","description":"Mungyeongsaejae Pass, which crosses Joryeongsan Mountain, has always been the highest and most dangerous mountain pass in Korea, being reputed to be too tall for even birds to fly over.
