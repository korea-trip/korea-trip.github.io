Originally, the temple was dubbed ‘Cheongnyangsa’ and the nearby mountain was called ‘Cheongnyangsan.’<br><br>Unfortunately, the temple was lost to fire during the Imjin War (1592) and was left desolate for 340 years. In 1938, a new temple was constructed, but was then torn down in 1966 to be rebuilt into eight new buildings. In 1977, the temple name was changed to ‘Heungnyunsa,’ which it is still known as today. <br><br>Heungnyunsa Temple is adjacent to  Songdo International City. The Memorial Park for the Incheon Landing Operation is located right near the entrance of the temple. <br><br>Though the view from the temple is eye-catching at any time of day, the view at twilight is particularly stunning. Those who are hoping for a longer look at temple life are encouraged to enroll in the Heungnyunsa temple stay, which guides visitors in experiencing Korean Buddhism.<br><br>The temple also operates a meditation center and a Manbuljeon Hall, a room that enshrines thousands of Buddha. A high-tech memorial center is open for visitors wishing to pay tribute to their ancestors.","regDate":"2022-08-11","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-11-1660228654791/1238886_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-08-11-1660228654791"},{"id":"2022-08-11-1660226065975","title":"Incheon Gyeongseo-dong Nokcheongja Kiln Site (인천 경서동 녹청자 요지)","description":"The Nokcheongja (Green Celadon) Kiln Site was designated as Historic Site No. 211 in May 1970.
