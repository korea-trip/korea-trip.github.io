It is divided into small canyons and has an outstanding view with rocky mountains on all sides. The valley was called Gangcheon Valley because clean and clear water flows like a spring on the hard rocks, and all the mountains around it were called Gangcheonsan Mountain. It is said that in the past it was called Yongcheonsan Mountain, named after the shape of two dragons waving their tails toward the sky and ascending to heaven.<br><br>Following the Noryeong Mountain Range to Chuwolsan Mountain, it forms Gwangdeoksan Mountain and Yongcheonsan Mountain. On Sanseongsan Mountain (two dragons from the eastern sky to the western sky) that towers high in the sky, two dragons run east side by side. There are numerous peaks, some famous ones are, Yeondaebong, Undaebong, Suyeongbong, Cheonjabong, Gitdaebong, Gwangjubong, Gyeonjebong, and Songrakbong peaks. Between these two mountains is a very deep valley. Some of the famous valleys are, Yeondaegyegok Valley, Seonnyeogyegok Valley (Jeobujegol), Wondeunggyegok Valley (Yongdaeamgol), Buntonggol Pass, Jijigol Valley, Somokgol Valley, Samindaegyegok Valley (Hwangwoojegol), Giwoojegol Valley, Senyanggol Valley, Multonggol Valley, Chodanggol Valley, Ujakgol Valley, Dongmakgol Valley, Geumganggyegok Valley (Tapsanggol), Seungbanggol Valley, Byeondugol Valley, etc. The clear water flowing from every valley joins into one and the sound of the water crashing against the rocks and stones echoes throughout the valley and enters Gangcheonho Lake.<br><br>When spring comes, willows bloom, and when the forsythia and azaleas are in full bloom, wild cherry blossoms reach full bloom on every mountain peak. The clear and clean water flows continuously between the gravel along the valley. Visitors can cool off the heat in this river that does not collect moss either because it is too cold or clean. On Gangcheonsan Mountain, there are beautiful shrubs and maple trees, and the baby maples and baby squirrels announce the arrival of autumn among the seven different types of maple trees. The multiple trails on the mountain are not steep or too dangerous, making it popular regardless of age. It is also ideal for mountaineering and mountain-loving hikers. The scenery of the river with white snow and icicles attracts painters who want to capture the moment on a canvas. Gangcheonsan Mountain has four distinct seasons making it a popular destination all year round.","regDate":"2022-08-01","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Nature","Natural Sites","County Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-01-1659323323304/2634995_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2022-08-01-1659323323304"},{"id":"2022-07-31-1659310755947","title":"Gangam Calligraphy Museum (Í∞ïÏïîÏÑúÏòàÍ¥Ä)","description":"The Gangam Calligraphy Museum (est. 1995) in Jeonju Hanok Village has on display over 1,000 works from famous artists such as Kim Jeong-hee (1786-1856, calligrapher, painter, & scholar), Lee Sam-man (1770-1847, calligrapher), Kim Hong-do (1745-?, artist), and Jeong Yak-yong (1762-1836, scholar).

Under King Mun's command, temples for the new fortress were built on east and west sides of the valley; the western temple was called Gaeam.

The road that runs up from the park entrance is lined with cherry trees that create a breathtaking tunnel of pink flowers each spring.
