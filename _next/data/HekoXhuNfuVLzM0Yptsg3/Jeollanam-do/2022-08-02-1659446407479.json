In 1998, records were found stating that Monk Mirananta first set foot in Jwaudu Village in Beopseong-myeon, Yeonggwang in AD 384 after passing through Dongjin in China. Subsequently, the site has turned into an attraction in honor of the monk and the spread of Buddhism.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-61-350-4674|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-02-1659446407479/1607919_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659446407479/1607919_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659446407479/1607923_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659446407479/1607923_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659446407479/1607924_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659446407479/1607924_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659446407479/2438042_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659446407479/2438042_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659446407479/2438044_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659446407479/2438044_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659446407479/2438047_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659446407479/2438047_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659446407479/2438048_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659446407479/2438048_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659446407479/2438051_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659446407479/2438051_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659446407479/2438052_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659446407479/2438052_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659446407479/1607920_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659446407479/1607920_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-61-350-4674](tel:+82613504674)\n- [üè†tour.yeonggwang.go.kr](http://tour.yeonggwang.go.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.3620118202\nlongitude: 126.4314037163\ntitle: 203, Baekjemunhwa-ro, Yeonggwang-gun, Jeollanam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Yeonggwang Bus Terminal, take a taxi for approx. 15 min to Birthplace of Baekje Buddhism.\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-02-1659446407479","title":"Birthplace of Baekje Buddhism (Î∞±Ï†úÎ∂àÍµêÏµúÏ¥àÎèÑÎûòÏßÄ)","description":"Unlike Goguryeo and Silla, Baekje's origin of Buddhism and how it spread had remained a mystery other than the story of how Indian monk Mirananta came to Yeonggwang and founded Bulgapsa Temple.
