In particular, it is home to Orodae Rock, cool enough to form dew even in the middle of the day and Gusipokpo Falls with a legend of a flying horse.\n<br><br>\nThe valley is located ten minutes away from the Seomjingang River Maehwa Village, and plum trees cover the valley in spring with plum blossoms. In autumn, the countless oak trees in the forest become an acorn factory for its habitats. Baegunsan Eochigyegok Valley is worth visiting at any time of the year and provides various agricultural products to local residents. Orodae Rock, located in the uppermost stream, refers to a rock that looks like a large courtyard. An inscription remains, saying that it is named Orodae because it is cool enough to form dew even in the midday of the summer. Legend says that Gusiso Pool at the base of Gusipokpo Falls is so wide that it will not dry up even in a draught.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-61-797-3333|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-01-1659375937828/1606764_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659375937828/1606764_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659375937828/1606766_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659375937828/1606766_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659375937828/1606767_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659375937828/1606767_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659375937828/1606768_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659375937828/1606768_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659375937828/1606769_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659375937828/1606769_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659375937828/1606771_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659375937828/1606771_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659375937828/2606026_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659375937828/2606026_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-61-797-3333](tel:+82617973333)\n- [üè†www.gwangyang.go.kr](http://www.gwangyang.go.kr/tour_culture/index.gwangyang)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.0579647522\nlongitude: 127.6862532865\ntitle: 531, Baekhak-ro, Gwangyang-si, Jeollanam-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-01-1659375937828","title":"Baegunsan Eochigyegok Valley (Î∞±Ïö¥ÏÇ∞ Ïñ¥ÏπòÍ≥ÑÍ≥°)","description":"Eochigyegok Valley, located in Eochi-ri, Jinsang-myeon, is 7 kilometers long, and is a valley with clear water flowing through the lush forest with rocks in all sizes that provide a resting spot.

In autumn, fields of silver grass unfold around the mountain peak, allowing for the Cheongwansan Silver Grass Festival to take place on Yeondaebong (silver grass plain). Also, from the top of the mountain, several grand landmarks like Dadohae archipelago, Wochulsan Mountain and Mudeungsan Mountain in nearby cities can be seen.
