Gaeseong, Suwon, Ganghwa and Gwangju are located in the north, south, west, and east direction respectively. Namhansanseong Fortress is located to the east in Gwangju. The park is situated on Namhansan Mountain, 24km southeast from Seoul and 6km northeast from Seongnam. The length of trails is a total of approximately 12.4 km (main fortress 8.9km, external fortress 3.2km, Sinnamsanseong Fortress 0.2km). The x_height is 7.3m.<br><br>\nThe fortress is alternately recorded as being the royal fortress of King Onjo of the Baekje Kingdom, whose father was King Dongmyeong during Goguryeo period or a fortress built in 673 during the reign of King Munmu (the 13th year) of Silla period during the heat of the Silla and Tang War. The old site was rebuilt several times, with its current style of construction being built in 1621 during King Gwanghae’s reign. <br><br> Namhansanseong’s circumference is approximately 12km, stacking small natural stones over big stones. The fortress includes Sueocheong (Namhansan Mountain Fortress Defense Command), Gwana (government office), storage, and a haenggung (temporary palace), as well as 80 wells and 45 springs. Also, administration was moved from Gwangju-eup to inside of the fortress, clearly showing the importance of Namhansanseong Fortress in that period. 12,700 people participated in a field exercise carried out for the first time after building the fortress by command of King Injo (17th year, 1639). These days, only a few buildings remain inside of the fortress including East and South Gate, Seojangdae, Hyeonjeolsa Temple, Yeonmu Hall, Janggyeongsa Temple, Jisudang, Yeongwoljeong, and Chimgwaejeong. Among these remaining buildings, four gates, Sueojangdae, and some parts of the fortress in the middle of West Gate still maintain their original forms. Namhansanseong Fortress is designated as Historical Site No. 57 and a provincial park.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-31-746-1088|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|Mondays|\n|usetime:|[Namhansanseong Haenggung]<br>April-October 10:00-18:00<br>November-March 10:00-17:00<br><br>* Last admission 30 minutes before closing.|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Hiking Course:|[Course 1] Sanseong Rotary – North Gate – West Gate – Sueojangdae – Yeongchunjeong – South Gate – Sanseong Rotary<br>[Course 2 ] Sangseong Rotary – Yeongwoljeong – Sungyeoljeon – West Gate – Sueojangdae – Sanseong Rotary <br>[Course 3 ] Namhansanseong Fortress UNESCO Heritage Center – Hyeonjeolsa Temple – Beolbong Peak  – Janggyeongsa Temple – Mangwolsa Temple – East Gate – Namhansanseong Fortress UNESCO Heritage Center<br>[Course 4] Sanseong Rotary – South Gate – Namjangdaeteo – East Gate – Jisudang Altar – Gaewonsa Temple – Sanseong Rotary<br>[Course 5] Namhansanseong Fortress UNESCO Heritage Center – East Gate – Dongjangdaeteo – North Gate – West Gate – Sueojangdae – Yeongchunjeong – South Gate – East Gate - Namhansanseong Fortress UNESCO Heritage Center|\n|Mountain Not Access Period:|Seasonal Forest Fire Watch<br>February 1-May 15, November 1-December 15<br><br>* TBD by park directors based on fire weather advisories, snow/precipitation levels, and other local conditions.|\n|Parking Fees:|Two-wheel vehicles: 500 won / Cars 1,000 won <BR>Buses: Under 12 seats 1,000 won / Over 12 seats 2,000 won<BR>Trucks: Under 4.5 ton 1,000 won / Over 4.5 ton 2,000 won|\n|Admission Fees:|[Namhansanseong Provincial Park]<br>Free<br><br> [Namhansanseong Haenggung] <br> Individual: Adults 2,000 won / Children 1,000 won <br> Group: Adults 1,600 won / Children 800 won<br> <br> * Group: 30 people or more<br> * Adults (ages 19-64), Children (ages 7-18)<br> * Free (ID required): Senior citizens (ages 65 & over)|\n|Available Facilities:|Benches, water supply systems, restrooms, cultural relics, Namhansanseong Fortress History Museum, memorial site, valley, etc.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|* Reservation: Namhansanseong Fortress Visitor's Center +82-31-745-2845<br>* Available languages: English, Japanese, Chinese|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-09-01-1662018070165/1589317_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-01-1662018070165/1589317_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-01-1662018070165/1589318_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-01-1662018070165/1589318_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-01-1662018070165/1589320_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-01-1662018070165/1589320_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-01-1662018070165/2612850_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-01-1662018070165/2612850_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-01-1662018070165/2612851_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-01-1662018070165/2612851_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-01-1662018070165/2612852_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-01-1662018070165/2612852_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-01-1662018070165/2612855_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-01-1662018070165/2612855_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-01-1662018070165/2612857_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-01-1662018070165/2612857_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-01-1662018070165/2652509_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-01-1662018070165/2652509_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-01-1662018070165/2612853_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-01-1662018070165/2612853_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-31-746-1088](tel:+82317461088)\n- [🏠www.gg.go.kr](http://www.gg.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.4766684605\nlongitude: 127.1883850251\ntitle: 731, Namhansanseong-ro, Gwangju-si, Gyeonggi-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway]<br>\nSanseong Station (Seoul Subway Line 8), Exit 2.<br>Take Bus No. 9 and get off at Namhansanseong Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-09-01-1662018070165","title":"Namhansanseong Provincial Park [UNESCO World Heritage] (남한산성도립공원 [유네스코 세계문화유산])","description":"Namhansanseong Provincial Park surrounds Namhansanseong Fortress, one of four forts built to protect Hanyang (the former name of Seoul).
