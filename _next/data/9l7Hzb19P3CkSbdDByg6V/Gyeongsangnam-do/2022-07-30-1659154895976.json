It is said to have been built to appease the spirit of a young woman named Arang, who met an unfortunate death. <br><br>\n\nAccording to the legend, Arang was mistakenly killed by a low-ranking officer who had loved her and tried to hug her. After her death, she becomes a ghost and appears to every district magistrate (highest-ranking officer in a region) to appeal for the investigation of her unfair death, but each district magistrate dies of a heart attack. <br><br>\nThen, a new district magistrate by the name Lee is dispatched to the area. Unlike his predecessors, Lee listens to the story of the ghost and finds the low-ranked officer who had killed her and punishes him. He found Arang‚Äôs body and holded a religious ceremony on her behalf. Aranggak was also built in her memory. <br><br>\n\nEvery year, an event called Arangje is held on April 16 by the lunar calendar in Aranggak Pavilion. Young maidens dressed in white hanbok perform a religious ceremony to soothe the sorrow of Arang. There is also a saying that the spirit of Arang will preserve the love of those couples who visit the pavilion together.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<BR> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-55-359-5788|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-30-1659154895976/2589450_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659154895976/2589450_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659154895976/2589451_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659154895976/2589451_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-55-359-5788](tel:+82553595788)\n- [üè†tour.miryang.go.kr</a> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br /> <a href=\"http://www.cha.go.kr/\">www.cha.go.kr](http://tour.miryang.go.kr/main/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.4914906717\nlongitude: 128.7556646276\ntitle: 324, Jungang-ro, Miryang-si, Gyeongsangnam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Train]<BR>\nFrom Seoul Station, take a train to Miryang Station.<br>\nFrom Miryang Station, take Bus No. 2, 2 Cheongun, 2 Chodong, 3 Sangdong, 6, or 6 Hwalseong and get off at Yeongnamnu Pavilion Bus Stop.<br>Walk for approx. 150m to arrive at Aranggak.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-30-1659154895976","title":"Aranggak Pavilion (ÏïÑÎûëÍ∞Å)","description":"Located in Naeil-dong in Miryang, Gyeongsangnam-do Province, Aranggak Pavilion sits in a bamboo forest.

It is a popular vacation destination in the summer. Also, many tourists come to drink the water containing acer mono sap, which is known to be produced in this region during the springtime.<br><br>Baenaegol Valley is just a short distance away from downtown Yangsan. The valley provides an opportunity to enjoy nature away from the hustle and bustle of the city center. The long valley is wedged between highlands, which results in at least two hours less of sunshine than other regions, so it feels cooler in the summer months. Strawberries are also widely grown in the area.","regDate":"2022-07-30","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Valleys"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228175_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-07-30-1659163505785"},{"id":"2022-07-30-1659159589087","title":"Baegundonggyegok Valley, Sancheong (Î∞±Ïö¥ÎèôÍ≥ÑÍ≥°(ÏÇ∞Ï≤≠))","description":"If you go 5 km up along the valley at Baegam-ri, under the thick woods, you will find a 180 square meter long stone named ‚ÄòJeomjeong Rock‚Äô and a small waterfall.
