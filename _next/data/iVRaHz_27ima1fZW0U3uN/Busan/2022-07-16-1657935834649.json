The average water level is 1~1.5 meters. It is located 3 kilometers from Busan's Jagalchi Market and was one of the first beaches to open in 1913. In 2000, the beach underwent a comprehensive 5-year reconstruction and reopened with restored and expanded coastlines and the addition of several fountains. Nearby attractions include Busan‚Äôs famed Jagalchi Seafood Market and Amnam Park. Amnam Park was a military protected area that opened to the public as a nature park in April 1996. Amnam Park, as well as Dudo Park, a famous sea fishing spot, connects to Songdo, where visitors can see a spectacular landscape with seagulls, a symbol of busan, and the quiet seascape with Yeongdo Island in the distance. \n<br><br>\nThe area has a variety of accommodation and dining options, and is well equipped with convenient facilities such as an overpass, promenade, boat yard, and parking lot. Amnam Park on the Songdo coast is a coastal ecological park. It has an observatory, a 3.8-kilometer promenade, a roadside cafe, and raw fish restaurants with a panoramic view of the Songdo coast and Busan Namhang Port. Another historically important attraction in the area is the Provisional Capital Memorial Hall that was used as the presidential residence for three years when Busan was the temporary capital during the Korean War.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-51-231-0252|\n|parking:|Available (17 lots / 670 spaces)|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Imhae Administration Service Office, accommodations, diving spot, Ocean Leisure and Sports Center, restroom, shower room, changing room, footbath site, etc.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-16-1657935834649/1572107_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-16-1657935834649/1572107_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-16-1657935834649/1572108_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-16-1657935834649/1572108_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-16-1657935834649/1572109_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-16-1657935834649/1572109_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-16-1657935834649/1572110_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-16-1657935834649/1572110_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-16-1657935834649/1572111_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-16-1657935834649/1572111_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-16-1657935834649/1572112_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-16-1657935834649/1572112_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-16-1657935834649/1572113_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-16-1657935834649/1572113_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-16-1657935834649/1572114_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-16-1657935834649/1572114_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-16-1657935834649/2504676_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-16-1657935834649/2504676_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-16-1657935834649/2504677_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-16-1657935834649/2504677_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-51-231-0252](tel:+82512310252)\n- [üè†tour.busan.go.kr](https://www.visitbusan.net/kr/index.do?menuCd=DOM_000000201001001000&uc_seq=286&lang_cd=ko)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.0739256715\nlongitude: 129.0164588470\ntitle: 100, Songdohaebyeon-ro, Seo-gu, Busan\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-16-1657935834649","title":"Busan Songdo Beach (Î∂ÄÏÇ∞ ÏÜ°ÎèÑÌï¥ÏàòÏöïÏû•)","description":"Songdo Beach is 800 meters long and 50 meters wide.

It was originally called Songhyeonsan Mountain, which means a mountain with a view of the sea through the dense pine tree forest. Later, the name was changed to Yongdusan Mountain, as the mountain peak was shaped similar to a dragon's head, protecting the area against foreign invaders overseas.<br><br>The mountain held shrines for the mountain gods built by the Japanese before the 8.15 Liberation. Now the mountain is home to a variety of monuments, including Cheokhwabi Monument, Chunghontap Pagoda, 4.19 Revolution Monument, a statue of Admiral Yi Sun-shin, and Busan Tower. During the Korean War, refugees built houses on the sides of the mountain all the way to the summit but these neighborhoods burned down twice, leaving the mountain bare. Since then, fierce efforts of planting trees have led to transforming the burnt mountain into a beautiful park. The park was called Unam Park at the time of the Liberal Party‚Äôs ruling but was renamed to Yongdusan Park after the April 19 Revolution. The park offers a beautiful view of Busan Port and the surrounding scenery. In particular, the night view from Busan Tower is magnificent.","regDate":"2022-08-18","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Busan","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-18-1660838172085/2640557_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Busan/2022-08-18-1660838172085"},{"id":"2022-08-18-1660831088170","title":"UN Memorial Cemetery in Korea (Ïû¨ÌïúÏú†ÏóîÍ∏∞ÎÖêÍ≥µÏõê)","description":"The UN Memorial Cemetery in Korea honors UN soldiers from 16 countries and UN aids from five countries that were killed in battle during the Korean War from 1950-1953.
