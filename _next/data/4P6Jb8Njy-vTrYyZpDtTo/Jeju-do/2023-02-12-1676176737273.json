The park is located approximately 700 meters above sea level, and is 10 ¬∞C lower in average temperature compared to that of Seogwipo‚Äôs downtown, providing the ideal condition to enjoy forest bathing and camping from spring to fall. The park is easily accessible by car, thanks to the paved road from the mountain‚Äôs foothills all the way up to the park‚Äôs entrance. It takes about 30 minutes by car from Seogwipo‚Äôs downtown to the recreational park. The park is densely packed with trees and the air is filled with the refreshing forest scent, and even has a pebble walking trail suitable for a barefoot massage. The forest is equipped with amenities such as a mountain cottage, forest bathing site, campfire site, cooking area, and auto-camping site. Although the amenities serve to provide visitors‚Äô convenience, they are minimized so as to prevent damage to the forest‚Äôs natural environment.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-64-738-4544|\n|opendate:|March 21, 1995|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|[Park hours] 09:00-18:00 (Last admission 17:00)<br>[Accommodations] Check-in 15:00 / Check-out 12:00<br>[Campsite] Check-in 13:00 / Check-out 12:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Parking Fees:|Compact cars 1,000 won / Small & mid-sized cars 2,000 won / Large-sized cars and vans 3,000 won|\n|Facility Utilization Fees:|[House in the Forest ]<br> Off-season and weekdays 46,000~104,000 won / Peak season and weekends 85,000~184,000 won<br><br> [Forest Recreational Center]<br> Off-season and weekdays 34,000~63,000 won / Peak season and weekends 60,000~107,000 won<br> * Admission and parking fees are exempted.<br> <br> [Group lodging]<br> Off-season and weekdays 200,000 won / Peak season and weekends 250,000 won<br> *   Additional fees may apply.

With no entrance as such, the cave is not open to the general public and thus its original form remains preserved to this day, giving it a high geological value. <Br><Br> Although the Dangcheomuldonggul Cave is technically a lava tube, it resembles a limestone cave due to the secondary geological formations of lime substances that have accumulated in the ground above the tube. The tunnel has a spectacular and mystical beauty with countless stalactites and stalagmites, as well as stalactite columns. The particularly thin stalactites and stalactic columns in this cave are well-known for their uniqueness and beauty. Although this is a relatively small lava tunnel, its exotic colors and the richness of the secondary topological formations make it extraordinary in terms of research value.

Records show people have been living on the islands since as long as 1271, during the reign of Goryeo King Wonjong, at which point they were referred to as Hupungdo Islands, serving as a safe harbor for ships sailing between Jeju and the mainland. The name changed to Chujado Islands during the Joseon dynasty due to the lush forest of walnut trees, chuja in the Jeollanam-do dialect. The ocean around the islands is a popular place for sea fishing, while the islands themselves offer outstanding views of nature along a Jeju Olle Trail Course.","regDate":"2023-02-15","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-15-1676446569108/870922_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-15-1676446569108"},{"id":"2023-02-15-1676443201688","title":"Byeoldobong Peak (Beri Oreum) (Î≥ÑÎèÑÎ¥â(Î≤†Î¶¨Ïò§Î¶Ñ))","description":"Situated in the east of Hwabuk 1-dong and along the coast, Byeoldobong is a parasitic mountain made of siliciclastic sedimentary rocks and lava.

Created particularly close to the earth‚Äôs surface, this cave has a number of entrance holes to the tunnel. Inside, the complex structure of the cave unfolds in the form of double-tiered or triple-tiered rooms.

Legend has it that the pond was created by the water raining down off of a dragon that ascended to heaven.
