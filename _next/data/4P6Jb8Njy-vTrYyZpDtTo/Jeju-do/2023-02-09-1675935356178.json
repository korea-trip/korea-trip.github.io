The crater is round and in the shape of a funnel.<br>  <br>It is said that Jeoji Oreum is as old as Jeoji Village. It is also called Dakmoru or Sae Oreum. Nearby, there are Gamaechang Oreum and Heoritdang, showing just how long the history of Jeoji Village is. In the past, people harvested wild weeds from Jeoji Oreum to cover their thatched-roof houses. Over time, trees were planted and today, Jeoji Oreum is covered with a dense forest. The area has been designated a Forest of Life since June 2005.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-064-740-6000|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Jeoji Oreum resting area, observatory|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-02-09-1675935356178/2517241_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-09-1675935356178/2517241_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-09-1675935356178/2517243_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-09-1675935356178/2517243_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-09-1675935356178/2517355_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-09-1675935356178/2517355_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-09-1675935356178/2517356_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-09-1675935356178/2517356_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-09-1675935356178/2517358_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-09-1675935356178/2517358_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-09-1675935356178/2517359_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-09-1675935356178/2517359_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-09-1675935356178/2517360_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-09-1675935356178/2517360_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-09-1675935356178/2517361_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-09-1675935356178/2517361_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-09-1675935356178/2517364_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-09-1675935356178/2517364_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-09-1675935356178/2517242_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-09-1675935356178/2517242_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n\n- [üè†www.visitjeju.net](http://www.visitjeju.net/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.3338221918\nlongitude: 126.2517754921\ntitle: Jungsanganseo-ro, Jeju-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Jeju Intercity Bus Terminal, take an intercity bus to West \nCoast line (Jeju.

The tunnel has a spectacular and mystical beauty with countless stalactites and stalagmites, as well as stalactite columns. The particularly thin stalactites and stalactic columns in this cave are well-known for their uniqueness and beauty. Although this is a relatively small lava tunnel, its exotic colors and the richness of the secondary topological formations make it extraordinary in terms of research value.

The name changed to Chujado Islands during the Joseon dynasty due to the lush forest of walnut trees, chuja in the Jeollanam-do dialect.
