Furthermore, it is where four generations of ancestors such as his great-grandfather Kim Jin-hu (martyred in 1814), great uncle Kim Han-hyun (1816), father Kim Jae-jun (1839), and priest Kim Dae-gun himself (martyred in 1846) lived.<br><br> He was chosen as a theological student in Golmaemashil and studied in Macao. In 1846, he was ordained as priest by Bishop Ferréol in Shanghai, Kim Ga Hang Cathedral. After his return to Korea, he worked in Yongin until September 1846 when he was tried, executed and died a martyr when he was only 26. Pope Johannes Paulus II appointed him a saint during his visit to Korea in May 1984. In Solmoe, Priest Kim Dae-gun’s statue and a memorial stands underneath the pine trees and his remains are placed inside the nearby cathedral.","regDate":"2022-11-15","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Holy Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-15-1668484699356/2635127_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Chungcheongnam-do/2022-11-15-1668484699356"},{"id":"2022-11-14-1668422705382","title":"Sinseong-ri Reed Field (신성리 갈대밭)","description":"As one of Korea’s top four fields of reeds, Sinseong-ri Reed Field (nearly 60,000 pyeong) has also been popularized as a filming location of the mega-hit Korean movie, “JSA.”<br><br>To protect the natural environment, only 2-3% of the entire area of field of reed has been developed into a park.
