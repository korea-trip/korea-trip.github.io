The large site is filled with traces of Baekje culture. Sabigung Palace is a reconstruction of a real royal palace from the Three Kingdoms period. Neungsa Temple, a royal temple representing the Baekje period, has been recreated according to the real size based on excavation research done at the historic site in Neungsan-ri, Buyeo-eup. Just inside Daetongmun Gate is the Five-story Stone Pagoda, the most prominent structure in the complex. Wiryeseong Fortress, built during the Hanseong Baekje Era, gives a different aspect of Baekje in comparison with Sabigung Palace from the Late Baekje Era. A panorama of the complex can be seen from Jehyangnu Pavilion.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|expagerange:|Open to visitors ages 7 and older|\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-41-408-7290|\n|restdate:|Mondays (open if Monday is a public holiday)|\n|usetime:|March-October 09:00-18:00<br>November-February 09:00-17:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Tour Course Information:|* Course  1 (Duration: 1 hr)<br> Baekje History & Culture Museum (3D viewing) → Jeongyangmun Gate→ Cheonjeongjeon Hall → Neugsa Temple → Living Culture Village → Jeongyangmun Gate<br><br> * Course 2 (Duration: 2 hr)<br> Jeongyangmun Gate→ Cheonjeongjeon Hall→ Neungsa Temple → Living Culture Village → Wiryeseong Fortress  →  Jeongyangmun Gate→ Baekje History & Culture Museum<br><br>* Course 3 (Duration:  3 hr)<br> Jeongyangmun Gate → Cheonjeongjeon Hall → Neungsa Temple → Gobun Park → Jehyangnu Pavilion → Living Culture Village → Wiryeseong Fortress  → Jeongyangmun Gate → Baekje History & Culture Museum|\n|Film Locations:|Variety program \"Running Man\"|\n|Admission Fees:|[Baekje Cultural Land & Baekje History & Culture Museum]<br>Individuals - Adults 6,000 won / Teenagers 4,500 won / Children 3,000 won<br>Groups - Adults 4,500 won / Teenagers 3,000 won / Children 1,500 won<br> <br>[Baekje History & Culture Museum]<br>Individuals - Adults 2,000 won / Teenagers 1,500 won / Children 1,000 won<br>Groups - Adults 1,500 won / Teenagers 1,200 won / Children 800 won<br> <br> * Groups: 20 or more people<br> * Adults (ages 19-64) / Teenagers (ages 13-18) / Children (ages 7-12) <br> * Free admission (ID required): Preschoolers (ages 6 & younger), senior citizens (ages 65 & older)|\n|Available Facilities:|Museum shop, restaurant, snack bar, rest area, facilities rental service (wheelchair, baby carriage, etc.), unmanned bike rental|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Available in English & Japanese<br>  Inquiries: +82-41-635-7740|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1099667_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1099667_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1099690_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1099690_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1099717_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1099717_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1099783_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1099783_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1099798_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1099798_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1601228_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1601228_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1601229_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1601229_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1601231_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1601231_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1601233_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1601233_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1601234_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1659004863960/1601234_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-41-408-7290](tel:+82414087290)\n- [🏠www.bhm.or.kr](http://www.bhm.or.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.3065816893\nlongitude: 126.9067759265\ntitle: 455, Baekjemun-ro, Buyeo-gun, Chungcheongnam-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-28-1659004863960","title":"Baekje Cultural Land (백제문화단지)","description":"Baekje Cultural Land is the largest history-themed park in Korea, built to share the beautiful culture of the Baekje Kingdom with the world.

In 1995, Yeongsanjeon (Cheonbuljeon) Hall was built and in 1997, Seonjae Preschool was opened. The temple is open for praying and meditation and also has a charnel house.

There are few existing records that mention the temple’s beginning. Some suggest that it was built around AD 527 during the 5th year of Baekje King Seongwang’s reign, but there is little evidence to support this theory. The only reference alluding to a specific time is Yeojidoseo (Detailed Survey of Korean Geography published during the late Joseon dynasty). It states Jeongamsa Temples location as on Oseosan Mountain, and Oseosan Mountain being surrounded by Hongsan Mountain and Baegwolsan Mountain and intersected by Hongju, Gyeolseong, and Boryeong. This indicates the temple was recognized in the mid-18th century and around the same time, Garamgo (a book about temples, published in the late 18th century) also states that Jeongamsa Temple is located approximately 11 kilometers to the east of Gyeolseonghyeon. It is still uncertain whether the temple referred to is Jeongamsa Temple on Oseosan Mountain. <br>Some foundation stones within the temple site measure 70-80 centimeters on each side. These stones indicate that the old Buddhist shrine of Jeongamsa Temple was laid out with five <em>kan</em> (Korean unit of measurement indicating the space between two pilars) at the front and three kan on the side. Future archaeological studies will help identify the true history of Jeongamsa Temple.","regDate":"2022-11-20","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Chungcheongnam-do/2022-11-20-1668919580082"},{"id":"2022-11-20-1668916695189","title":"Gongseri Catholic Church (아산 공세리성당)","description":"Gongseri Catholic Church was founded in 1894 as the main parish of the Daejeon diocese in Gongse-ri, Inju-myeon that connects Asanman Bay to Sapgyocheon Stream.

This was the first Catholic church in Chungcheongnam-do and the religion spread across Anseong, Onyang, and Dunpo to establish regional churches respectively. The grounds have three graves of prosecuted martyrs, a parish and rectory, retreat house, and meeting room.
