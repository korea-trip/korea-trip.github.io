The island is 53 kilometers off the mainland coast and can only be reached by taking a two-and-a-half-hour boat ride from Daecheonhang Port. The history of the islands inhabitation dates back to 202 BC when a Chinese General named Jeonhoeng settled here with about 500 followers after fleeing his failing Je Kingdom. Every year the villagers have a ceremony to commemorate the General, and even pray to him for strength during childbirth.<br><br>The evergreen forest located behind the main village is designated Natural Monument No. 136, and is comprised of many tree species. The most famous attraction in the forest is called the Love Trees, two camellia trees that have grown entwined. The locals believe if a young couple passes between the two tree trunks, they will have eternal love. Another must-see attraction on Oeyeondo Island is the sun setting over the horizon. The scene is so beautiful, it has been classified as one of the Eight Scenic Views of Boryeong.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <BR>• For more info: +82-41-932-2023|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-11-1668156501537/2671536_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668156501537/2671536_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-11-1668156501537/2671537_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668156501537/2671537_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-11-1668156501537/2671538_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668156501537/2671538_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-11-1668156501537/2671539_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668156501537/2671539_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-11-1668156501537/2671540_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668156501537/2671540_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-11-1668156501537/2671541_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668156501537/2671541_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-11-1668156501537/2671542_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668156501537/2671542_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-11-1668156501537/2671543_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668156501537/2671543_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-11-1668156501537/2671544_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668156501537/2671544_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-41-932-2023](tel:+82419322023)\n- [🏠www.brcn.go.kr/tour.do](https://bit.ly/3xuopm9)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.2264434555\nlongitude: 126.0803884162\ntitle: 64, Oeyeondo 1-gil, Boryeong-si, Chungcheongnam-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-11-1668156501537","title":"Oeyeondo Island (외연도)","description":"Oeyeondo Islands name carries the meaning of being a far-distant island hidden in fog.

There are few existing records that mention the temple’s beginning. Some suggest that it was built around AD 527 during the 5th year of Baekje King Seongwang’s reign, but there is little evidence to support this theory. The only reference alluding to a specific time is Yeojidoseo (Detailed Survey of Korean Geography published during the late Joseon dynasty). It states Jeongamsa Temples location as on Oseosan Mountain, and Oseosan Mountain being surrounded by Hongsan Mountain and Baegwolsan Mountain and intersected by Hongju, Gyeolseong, and Boryeong. This indicates the temple was recognized in the mid-18th century and around the same time, Garamgo (a book about temples, published in the late 18th century) also states that Jeongamsa Temple is located approximately 11 kilometers to the east of Gyeolseonghyeon. It is still uncertain whether the temple referred to is Jeongamsa Temple on Oseosan Mountain. <br>Some foundation stones within the temple site measure 70-80 centimeters on each side. These stones indicate that the old Buddhist shrine of Jeongamsa Temple was laid out with five <em>kan</em> (Korean unit of measurement indicating the space between two pilars) at the front and three kan on the side. Future archaeological studies will help identify the true history of Jeongamsa Temple.","regDate":"2022-11-20","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Chungcheongnam-do/2022-11-20-1668919580082"},{"id":"2022-11-20-1668916695189","title":"Gongseri Catholic Church (아산 공세리성당)","description":"Gongseri Catholic Church was founded in 1894 as the main parish of the Daejeon diocese in Gongse-ri, Inju-myeon that connects Asanman Bay to Sapgyocheon Stream.
