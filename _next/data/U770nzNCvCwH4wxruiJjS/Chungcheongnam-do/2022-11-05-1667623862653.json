The temple, which was founded during the&nbsp;5th year of the Baekje Kingdom, has an interesting legend behind its origin. <br><br>According to the legend, an old monk fell asleep after praying under a large rock on the slopes of Seongheungsan Mountain. In his dream, a large bird glowing in gold  flew in from the west and sat on the rock where Daejosa currently stands. While the bird continuoulsy flapped its wings, a ray of light shone on the rock and it was there that the statue of Avalokitasvara Bodhisattva appeared. <br><br>The old monk had the same dream at the same time for many days. He recounted his dream to the seongju (castle lord), who then reported it to King Seong of Baekje. The king interpreted the dream as a sign that it was the right time to move the capital of Baekje to Sabi (now Buyeo) and ordered the construction of a large temple at the location that appeared in the dream. The temple was so big that even at a hurried pace, it would still take 10 years to build. Workers had to work day and night, and every time the workers felt tired, birds would come singing to brighten up the atmosphere so that the workers can forget the fatigue and continue working. Hence, the temple was completed after only&nbsp;five years. Because of the golden bird, the temple was named Daejosa, literally meaning temple of a great bird.<br><br> The rock on which Avalokitasvara Bodhisattva appeared in the dream was recreated as a stone statue of a Buddha. This standing stone Maitreya Bodhisattva statue is a fine work of sculpture which, along with the stone Bodhisattva of Gwanchoksa Temple (Treasure No. 218), is a representative heritage of the early Gorye period.<br><br>In front of Wontongbojeon Hall (a hall enshrining Avalokitasvara Bodhisattva) stands a pagoda. In the old days, the stone pagoda used to have only the cover stones but as the pagoda body stones were found, the structure was completely restored in 1975. This pagoda is assumed to have been built in the early days of the Goryeo Kingdom.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-41-833-2510|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Korean Info.

There are few existing records that mention the temple’s beginning. Some suggest that it was built around AD 527 during the 5th year of Baekje King Seongwang’s reign, but there is little evidence to support this theory. The only reference alluding to a specific time is Yeojidoseo (Detailed Survey of Korean Geography published during the late Joseon dynasty). It states Jeongamsa Temples location as on Oseosan Mountain, and Oseosan Mountain being surrounded by Hongsan Mountain and Baegwolsan Mountain and intersected by Hongju, Gyeolseong, and Boryeong. This indicates the temple was recognized in the mid-18th century and around the same time, Garamgo (a book about temples, published in the late 18th century) also states that Jeongamsa Temple is located approximately 11 kilometers to the east of Gyeolseonghyeon. It is still uncertain whether the temple referred to is Jeongamsa Temple on Oseosan Mountain. <br>Some foundation stones within the temple site measure 70-80 centimeters on each side. These stones indicate that the old Buddhist shrine of Jeongamsa Temple was laid out with five <em>kan</em> (Korean unit of measurement indicating the space between two pilars) at the front and three kan on the side. Future archaeological studies will help identify the true history of Jeongamsa Temple.","regDate":"2022-11-20","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Chungcheongnam-do/2022-11-20-1668919580082"},{"id":"2022-11-20-1668916695189","title":"Gongseri Catholic Church (아산 공세리성당)","description":"Gongseri Catholic Church was founded in 1894 as the main parish of the Daejeon diocese in Gongse-ri, Inju-myeon that connects Asanman Bay to Sapgyocheon Stream.
