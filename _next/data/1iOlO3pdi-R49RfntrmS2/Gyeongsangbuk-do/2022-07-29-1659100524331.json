The valley is curved and features unusually shaped rocks with names like Buddha Rock and Love Rock. The valley is made of gneiss rock that was formed over 2 billion years ago. Some of the most unique of these outcroppings are black and white stripes like that of a zebra, and eye structures. The striped structures were formed when the white and black components of the rock were separated by high heat and then pressed together under strong pressure. The eye-shaped structures were made by the white components combining.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-53-950-7996|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-29-1659100524331/183272_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659100524331/183272_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659100524331/183273_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659100524331/183273_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659100524331/656526_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659100524331/656526_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659100524331/656529_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659100524331/656529_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659100524331/656531_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659100524331/656531_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659100524331/656532_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659100524331/656532_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659100524331/656533_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659100524331/656533_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659100524331/656537_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659100524331/656537_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659100524331/656538_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659100524331/656538_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659100524331/656541_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659100524331/656541_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-53-950-7996](tel:+82539507996)\n- [üè†geotourism.or.kr](https://geotourism.or.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.9660700942\nlongitude: 129.3205333899\ntitle: 2758, Buryeonggyegok-ro, Uljin-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Dong Seoul Bus Terminal, take an intercity bus to Uljin.<br>\nAcross from Uljin Terminal, take a local bus bound for Buryeongsa Temple.<br>\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-29-1659100524331","title":"Buryeonggyegok Valley [National Geopark] (Î∂àÏòÅÍ≥ÑÍ≥° (Í≤ΩÎ∂Å ÎèôÌï¥Ïïà Íµ≠Í∞ÄÏßÄÏßàÍ≥µÏõê))","description":"Buryeonggyegok Valley is a 15-kilometer-long valley that runs from Seowon-ri, Uljin-gun to Haenggok-ri, Geunnam-myeon.

The temple was built in the Silla Era and, with 16 buildings, is the second largest temple after Bulguksa. <br><br>Legend has it that the temple was originally built by the Venerable Gwang-yu, a sage from India, in the early part of the Silla Kingdom. The temple was reportedly called Imjeongsa at first, but was later changed to Girimsa after undergoing expansive renovations by Monk Wonhyo. It is still unclear exactly what year the temple was built in.   <br><br>Girimsa is divided into two main areas. The first is the area around Daejeokgwangjeon Hall where the statue of Birojanabul is enshrined. The second is the area around the majestic 500-year-old bo tree (a kind of large fig tree) that is home to a wooden pagoda, the Seongbo Museum, Samsingak, Mangbujeon, and Gwaneumjeon halls. Daejeokgwangjeon Hall was first built during Queen Seondeoks reign, and was rebuilt six times since its original construction. Its simple but majestic architecture is characterized by baeheullim (aka, entasis columns) and a Dapoyangsik (Dapo-style) single-tiered gabled roof. <br><br>Girimsa is famous for Ojongsu, water that is said to have five different tastes. It consists of gamrosu, which is best for making tea; hwajeongsu, which supposedly gives comfort to the drinker; janggunsu, which makes the body stronger; myeongansu, which gives clear vision; and otaksu, which is said to sparkle so brightly that it attracts all the birds of the air. During Japanese colonial rule, the source of janggunsu, literally meaning ‚Äòwater of a general,‚Äô was reportedly blocked off by Japanese soldiers, who were afraid the water would give the Korean people the strength to overthrow them. Except for janggunsu, water still continues to flow from each source. <br>On the way to Girimsa temple is Golgulsa Temple, well known for its 12 grottos. Golgulsa was originally a hermitage of Girimsa. After becoming an independent institution, it became the center of Seonmudo practice in Korea. The temple aims to promote the art of seonmudo on a national and international level.","regDate":"2022-11-25","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-25-1669361755171/179593_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-11-25-1669361755171"},{"id":"2022-11-25-1669358585090","title":"Geumosan Provincial Park (Í∏àÏò§ÏÇ∞ÎèÑÎ¶ΩÍ≥µÏõê)","description":"Geumosan Mountain (976 m) is part of the Sobaeksan Mountain Range, and was designated as a provincial park in 1970.
