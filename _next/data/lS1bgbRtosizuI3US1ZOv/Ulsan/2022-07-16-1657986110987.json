{"pageProps":{"content":"![Jinha Beach (진하해수욕장)](/2022-07-16-1657986110987/217383_image2_1.webp)\n  \n## Overview\n\n> Jinha Beach is located 20 kilometers southeast of Ulsan and is a little slice of summer paradise measuring 1 kilometer in length and 300 meters in x_width. Like most beaches along the southern coast, the waters of Jinha are shallow, warm, and calm, making it a perfect place for swimming. The deep scent of the surrounding pine trees mixes with the sea breeze and gives the beach an intimate atmosphere despite its relatively large size.<br><br>\n\nCamping is allowed in the pine woods and is free of charge. Simple shower booths and changing rooms are available for the convenience of the visitors. Freshwater river bathing is also available as the water from Hoeyagang River from Munsusan Mountain flows into the beach area.\n<br><br>\nNear the beach is Ideokdo Island, which consists of two mid-ocean rocks, and Myeongseungdo Island, which can be reached on foot. The latter, in particular, is popular for its beautiful sunset and is famous as a great fishing spot for noraemi, flounder, and rockfish. Around 10 kilometers away is Ganjeolgot Lighthouse, which is in operation 24 hours a day.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|expagerange:|Open to visitors of all ages|\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-52-238-1438|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Shower booth, drinking fountain, changing room, cooking area, tube, parasol, etc.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-16-1657986110987/217384_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-16-1657986110987/217384_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-16-1657986110987/2507179_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-16-1657986110987/2507179_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-16-1657986110987/2507180_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-16-1657986110987/2507180_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-16-1657986110987/2507181_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-16-1657986110987/2507181_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-16-1657986110987/2507184_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-16-1657986110987/2507184_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-16-1657986110987/2507185_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-16-1657986110987/2507185_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-16-1657986110987/2507186_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-16-1657986110987/2507186_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-16-1657986110987/2507187_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-16-1657986110987/2507187_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-16-1657986110987/530644_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-16-1657986110987/530644_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-52-238-1438](tel:+82522381438)\n- [🏠tour.ulju.ulsan.kr](http://tour.ulju.ulsan.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.3827277372\nlongitude: 129.3451995038\ntitle: Jinha-ri, Ulju-gun, Ulsan\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-16-1657986110987","title":"Jinha Beach (진하해수욕장)","description":"Jinha Beach is located 20 kilometers southeast of Ulsan and is a little slice of summer paradise measuring 1 kilometer in length and 300 meters in x_width.

The jusangjeolli at the shore of Hwaam Maeul Village were created by basalt lava that erupted in the Tertiary period of the Cenozoic Era about 20 million years ago. The columnar basalt formations were created as the lava cooled and shrank into cracks. The rocks look like wood stacked horizontally or vertically en masse. The length of the columns average around 20 meters and diagonally are about 50 centimeters at the longest cross-section. Of the columnar lava formations on the East Coast, the Jusangjeolli in Hwaam are the oldest, so it is academically invaluable. Shaped in various angles, the rocks also offer a great landscape for sightseeing.","regDate":"2022-07-16","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Ulsan","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-16-1657993154686/1357511_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Ulsan/2022-07-16-1657993154686"},{"id":"2022-07-16-1657990365505","title":"Jujeon Mongdol Beach (주전몽돌해변)","description":"Jujeon Mongdol Beach is one of 12 must visit attractions of Ulsan.
