The nearly 12-kilometer-long Daewonsagyegok Valley's stream water originates from the highest peak of Jirisan Mountain called Cheonwangbong Peak, and flows through Jungbong and Habong Peaks, as well as Ssukbatjae Pass, Saejae Pass, Wangdeungjae Pass, Bammeorijae Pass, and Ungseokbong Peak.  Before reaching the valley, the water joins the currents from Sinbatgol, Jogaegol, and Bambatgol Valleys. The volume of water increases as it passes Saejae and Oegok Village and reaches Yupyeong-ri where Daewonsa Temple is located. The incessant sound of running water fills the silence of the forest as if Buddhist nuns were chanting blessings.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|expagerange:|Open to visitors of all ages|\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-55-970-7201~5|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-30-1659206633447/2671384_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659206633447/2671384_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659206633447/2671385_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659206633447/2671385_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659206633447/2671387_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659206633447/2671387_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659206633447/2671388_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659206633447/2671388_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659206633447/2671389_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659206633447/2671389_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659206633447/2671390_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659206633447/2671390_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659206633447/2671391_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659206633447/2671391_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659206633447/2671392_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659206633447/2671392_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659206633447/2671393_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659206633447/2671393_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659206633447/2671394_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659206633447/2671394_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-55-970-7201](tel:+82559707201)\n- [üè†jiri.knps.or.kr</a><br/><a href=\"http://www.sancheong.go.kr/tour/index.do\" target=\"_blank\">www.sancheong.go.kr](http://jiri.knps.or.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.3563249828\nlongitude: 127.8101068526\ntitle: Samjang-myeon, Sancheong-gun, Gyeongsangnam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Express/Intercity Bus]<br>\nTake a bus from Seoul Nambu Terminal or Dong Seoul Bus Terminal to Sancheong Intercity Bus Terminal.<br><br>\n[Taxi]<br>\nApprox. 45 min from Sancheong Intercity Bus Terminal.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-30-1659206633447","title":"Daewonsagyegok Valley (ÎåÄÏõêÏÇ¨Í≥ÑÍ≥°)","description":"Daewonsagyegok Valley is a place where one can be appreciate nature's musical harmony of stream water, wind brushing against the leaves, and the chirping of birds.

The glittery surface and towering cliffs create a spectacular backdrop. Clear footprints of dinosaurs that lived during the Cretaceous Period of the Mesozoic Era remain extending over the coast around Sangjogam region, and thus the area was designated Goseong-gun Gosi No. 20. on November 10, 1983. <br>The beach in front of the Youth Center contains shingles worn down by the tide and a precipitous wall of stratified rocks can be seen beyond the wide bedrock of dinosaur footprints. The rocks are named after the table leg-shaped stone caves such as ‚ÄúSsangjok‚Äù or ‚ÄúSsangbal‚Äù. Many oddly shaped rocks inside the caves have their own folktales.<br>According to one tale, fairies from heaven came down to the Sangjokgul Cave to weave clothes out of brocade for the King of Heaven, and bathed in the Seonnyoetang Pond. The shape of a loom and a puddle still exist. Nearby the cave, Chotdaebawi Rock and Byeongpungbawi Rock create scenery beyond description and leisure cruise boats toss up gentle sea waves. Naturally, the park continuously attracts numerous tourists in all seasons. <br>Also, many are drawn to the mysterious dinosaur footprint fossils at Sangjogam. The site is recognized as one of three major dinosaurs sites in the world, along with those in Brazil and Canada. The footprints belong to dinosaurs familiarized by the popular movie, ‚ÄòJurassic Park‚Äô, such as Brontosaurus, Brachiosaurus, Allosaurus and Naranosaurus. It has been designated Natural Monument No. 411, as dinosaur footprints are valuable resources in discovering the uncovered mysteries of life before the appearance of mankind.","regDate":"2022-12-29","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","County Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-29-1672303057153/1611219_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-29-1672303057153"},{"id":"2022-12-29-1672299315401","title":"Samcheonpodaegyo Park (ÏÇºÏ≤úÌè¨ÎåÄÍµêÍ≥µÏõê)","description":"Samcheonpodaegyo Park is located near the landmark of Namhae, Samcheonpodaegyo Bridge, which connects Sacheon-si to nearby island.","regDate":"2022-12-29","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Architectural Sights","Bridges"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-29-1672299315401"},{"id":"2022-12-29-1672295914657","title":"Okpo Shipyard of Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (ÎåÄÏö∞Ï°∞ÏÑ†Ìï¥Ïñë(Ï£º) Ïò•Ìè¨Ï°∞ÏÑ†ÏÜå)","description":"Okpo Shipyard of Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering spans over a 4000,000„é° land and consists of large-scale specialized facilities and equipments for shipbuilding and repairs such as a dock that can handle a 1,000,000 ton vessel and a 900 ton Goliath crane.
