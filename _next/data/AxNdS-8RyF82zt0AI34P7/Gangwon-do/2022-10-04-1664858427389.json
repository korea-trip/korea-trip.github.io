The signboards contain inscriptions of&nbsp;famous ancient scholars such as Jeilgyeongjeong (The best riverside pavilion; 1662) by Heo Mok, Jukseoru and Gwandong Jeilru (The best pavilion in Gwandong; 1711) by Yi Seong-jo, and Haeseon Yuhui Jiso (The place that marine gods enjoy; 1837) by Yi Gyu-heon. Others who have left their mark include King Sukjong (1674-1720), King Jeongjo (1776-1800) and Yulgok YiYi (1536-1584).
