Naksansa Temple is one of the foremost sights of Yangyang, and one of the most historic sites in the region. Along with Ganghwa‚Äôs Bomunsa Temple and Namhae‚Äôs Boriam Hermitage, it is said to be one of the three centers of the cult of Avalokitesvara in Korea. Its handsome view overlooking the East Sea has earned it a spot in the Eight Sights of Gwandong (eight famous sights in Yeongdong region of Gangwon-do), documented throughout the ages in many classic literature and poetry. Today‚Äôs Naksansa Temple is a product of many restorations and expansions, and has many examples of cultural heritage within its walls.
