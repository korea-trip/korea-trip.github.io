The island has rough mountain ridges and consists of cliffs, making a magnificent scenery. With Doksilsan Mountain (alt. 639 m, the highest peak in Sinan-gun) standing in the middle, the island is surrounded by cliffs, creating a mysterious aura. The area is loved by fishers as various fish like anchovy, croaker, hairtail, horse mackerel, sea bream, and others can be found in the surrounding waters, as well as a paradise of unusual migratory birds like the fork-tailed petrel, shearwater, and teal.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<BR>• For more info: +82-61-275-9300|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Film Locations:|Variety Show \"2 Days & 1 Night\"|\n|Tour Course Information:|1) Route 1: Daltteulmok – No. 1 Bunker – No. 2 Bunker – Saetgaejae Pass<br>2) Route 2: Saetgaejae Pass – Hoeryongsan Mountain – 1-gu Village<br>3) Route 3: No. 1 Bunker – Samgeori Intersection – Doksilsan Mountain<br>4) Route 4: Doksilsan Mountain – Gageodo Lighthouse<br>5) Route 5: Gageodo Lighthouse – 3-gu Village – Samgeori Intersection<br>6) Route 6: 2-gu Village – Gageodo Lighthouse <br>7) Route 7: Doksilsan Mountain – 2-gu Village|\n|Available Facilities:|Accommodations, Songnyeon Post Box, lighthouse, restaurants, etc.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-18-1674038301189/2026830_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-18-1674038301189/2026830_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-18-1674038301189/2026833_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-18-1674038301189/2026833_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-18-1674038301189/2026836_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-18-1674038301189/2026836_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-18-1674038301189/2026840_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-18-1674038301189/2026840_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-18-1674038301189/2026831_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-18-1674038301189/2026831_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-18-1674038301189/2026835_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-18-1674038301189/2026835_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-18-1674038301189/2026838_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-18-1674038301189/2026838_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-61-275-9300](tel:+82612759300)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 34.0740166502\nlongitude: 125.1125145360\ntitle: 38-2, Gageodo-gil, Sinan-gun, Jeollanam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Ferry]<br>\nTake a ferry from Mokpo Port Coastal Terminal to Gageodo Island.\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-18-1674038301189","title":"Gageodo Island (Soheuksando Island) (가거도(소흑산도))","description":"Gageodo Island is the southwesternmost island in Korea, located rather close to China.

The original building burned down near the end of the war, and Admiral Yi Sun-sins successor, Yi Si-eon, constructed Jinnamgwan Hall, a large <em>gaeksa</em> (government officer guesthouse) at the site in 1599.<br /><br />Jinnamgwan Hall is a single-story gable-roofed building with 15 <em>kan</em> (traditional Korean measurement between two pillars) on the front and 5 kan on the sides.

Unfortunately, most of the temple buildings have been destroyed and only the main hall, Daeungjeon Hall, and a few smaller structures such as the living quarters remain on site today. The temple was originally called Ssanggyesa Temple because the waters of two valleys meet in front of this temple. It was renamed Jeongsusa Temple during the latter part of the Joseon dynasty (1392-1905).<br><br>The temple was reportedly established by the state monk Doseon-guksa in the first year of the reign of Silla Kingdom’s King Aejang (800). However, the temple’s founding year preceded the monk’s year of birth so there seems to have been a mistake in the year of foundation. Daeungjeon, the main hall, has three rooms in the front and two on the sides with a gambrel roof. Designated as Jeollanam-do Tangible Cultural Property, the structure features a modest and simple architecture that is estimated to date back to the latter half of the Joseon dynasty.","regDate":"2023-02-04","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollanam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Jeollanam-do/2023-02-04-1675506964115"},{"id":"2023-02-04-1675503361164","title":"Jeamsan Recreational Forest (제암산자연휴양림)","description":"Jeamsan Mountain is beautiful throughout the year with royal azaleas in spring, cool water in summer, silver grass in fall, and a snow-covered mountain in winter.
