The village became the center of traditional pottery during the Joseon dynasty (1392-1910) for about 500 years due to the easily obtainable materials in the areas. Icheon Ceramics Village was also the center of Joseon Baekja ceramics.  Presently, about 80 pottery factories are congregated at the village, and about 300 pottery kilns are in use. \n<br>\nVisitors can observe the pottery production process, and purchase them directly. It is worthwhile to see the crafts of these potters known as Living Cultural Treasures of Korea for creating the highest quality handicrafts.  Not only are the traditional Cheongja, Baekja, and Buncheong pottery produced here, but you can also view modern design pottery.  The Haegang Ceramics Art Center is the only ceramics Art Center in Korea, where you can learn about ceramics.  One of the must-see events at Icheon Ceramics Village is the internationally famous “Icheon Ceramics Festival” held every year.  Displayed pottery as well as, pottery classes, traditional kiln handling, pottery character show, and even parades are held.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-31-633-6381|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Ceramic Museum, ceramic stores|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Korean Info.

These rocks are basaltic, and are commonly called gombo (a face with chicken pox marks) rock because they are covered with small holes that form from air bubbles when volcanic lava cools rapidly. The surrounding scenery of the Hantangang River area is truly breathtaking and is also the site of a famous amusement park. The Hantangang River Resort, located in the lower region of the Hantangang River, stretches along 1.5 kilometers of the river's shore between the Saranggyo Bridge and the Hantangyo Bridge in Jeongok-ri, Yeoncheon-gun. The Hantangang River flows from the Pyeonggang River in North Korea and through through Cheorwon, Pocheon and Yeoncheon and eventually joins the Imjingang River. The river features many scenic points including a large valley with cliffs that consist of many rare rocks. The resort is a great place for rest and relaxation, and has facilities for the whole family, maintaining campsites for cars and motor homes, a dinosaur-themed Children’s Character Park, Children’s Transportation Land, a water park, an ecological pond, and a soccer field. Additionally, the Goseokjeong Pavilion and Sundam Valley are located nearby upstream.","regDate":"2022-09-15","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Tourist Complexes"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-15-1663223162380/2431947_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-09-15-1663223162380"},{"id":"2022-09-15-1663218185847","title":"Gwangju Gonjiam Ceramic Park (광주 곤지암도자공원)","description":"Located in Sam-ri, Gwangju in Gyeonggi-do, Gwangju Gonjiam Ceramic Park is largely comprised of a historic site from the Old Stone Age Era.
