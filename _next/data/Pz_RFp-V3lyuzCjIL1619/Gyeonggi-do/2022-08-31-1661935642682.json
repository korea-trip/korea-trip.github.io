The site holds the graves of Saint Andreas Kim Daegeon, Korea‚Äôs first Catholic Saint; his mother Ursula; Bishop Ferr√©ol, the third head of the Joseon parish who ordained Priest Kim; and Vincentius Lee Minsik who buried Saint Kim‚Äôs body. Visitors can feel the peaceful and serene atmosphere when walking around the site. \nThe reason it came to be called ‚ÄòMirinae‚Äô is that Korean Catholics came to this place in secret to avoid persecution during the late Joseon dynasty, and the lamplight coming from their homes in the village where they settled resembled the starlight of the Milky Way.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<BR> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-31-674-1256|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Tour Course Information:|Downtown Anseong - Guramsa Temple (4 km) - Nogokhosu Lake ( 6km) - Nogok three-way street (0.5 km) - Mirinae Holy Site (5 km)<br><br> * Anseong I.C. - Chungang University Entrance (Anseong Machum Museum) - Bogae-myeon (Art Center Mano) - Namsadang Training Center - Neorigul Cultural Village - Taepyeongmu Training Center - Gosam-myeon - Mirinae Holy Site|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-31-1661935642682/190824_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-31-1661935642682/190824_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-31-1661935642682/486103_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-31-1661935642682/486103_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-31-1661935642682/1589719_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-31-1661935642682/1589719_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-31-1661935642682/1589720_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-31-1661935642682/1589720_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-31-1661935642682/1589721_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-31-1661935642682/1589721_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-31-1661935642682/1589722_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-31-1661935642682/1589722_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-31-1661935642682/1589724_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-31-1661935642682/1589724_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-31-1661935642682/1589725_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-31-1661935642682/1589725_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-31-674-1256](tel:+82316741256)\n- [üè†www.mirinai.or.kr](http://www.mirinai.or.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.1461885444\nlongitude: 127.2586379926\ntitle: 420, Mirinaeseongji-ro, Anseong-si, Gyeonggi-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>\nFrom Dong Seoul Bus Terminal, take a bus to Anseong Bus Terminal.\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-31-1661935642682","title":"Mirinae Holy Site (ÎØ∏Î¶¨ÎÇ¥ ÏÑ±ÏßÄ)","description":"The word ‚ÄòMirinae,‚Äô from the Mirinae Holy Site in Anseong, Gyeonggi-do, is a pure Korean word for the Milky Way.

These rocks are basaltic, and are commonly called gombo (a face with chicken pox marks) rock because they are covered with small holes that form from air bubbles when volcanic lava cools rapidly. The surrounding scenery of the Hantangang River area is truly breathtaking and is also the site of a famous amusement park. The Hantangang River Resort, located in the lower region of the Hantangang River, stretches along 1.5 kilometers of the river's shore between the Saranggyo Bridge and the Hantangyo Bridge in Jeongok-ri, Yeoncheon-gun. The Hantangang River flows from the Pyeonggang River in North Korea and through through Cheorwon, Pocheon and Yeoncheon and eventually joins the Imjingang River. The river features many scenic points including a large valley with cliffs that consist of many rare rocks. The resort is a great place for rest and relaxation, and has facilities for the whole family, maintaining campsites for cars and motor homes, a dinosaur-themed Children‚Äôs Character Park, Children‚Äôs Transportation Land, a water park, an ecological pond, and a soccer field.
