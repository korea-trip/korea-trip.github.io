It spans over 1,635m in length, 2m in x_width, and 2m in x_height and is located 52km from Seoul. It is estimated that approximately 30,000 soldiers could move through the tunnel per hour. The scale is similar to the 2nd Tunnel, but it was thought to be more threatening as an invasion tool than the 1st and 2nd Tunnels. Located only 4km away from Imjingak toward the southwest and 3.5km from the Tongilchon area, it is accessible by car in approximately 45 min from Seoul.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-31-940-8526,<br>+82-31-954-0303|\n|parking:|[Imjingak Parking Lot]<br>Compact car 1,000 / Small-sized car 2,000 won / Mid-sized car 3,000 won / Large-sized car 5,000 won|\n|restdate:|Mondays & Public holidays (Excluding weekends, Seollal/Chuseok)|\n|usetime:|Weekdays 09:20-15:00 / Weekends 09:20-15:30|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Tour Course Information:|The 3rd Tunnel (DMZ video room) ‚Üí Dora Observatory ‚Üí Dorasan Station ‚Üí Tongilchon<br> * Tour course subject to change.|\n|Available Facilities:|Tongilchon local produce, convenience store|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-09-09-1662709464827/2617823_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-09-1662709464827/2617823_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-09-1662709464827/2617824_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-09-1662709464827/2617824_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-31-940-8526](tel:+82319408526)\n- [üè†www.dmz.go.kr](http://www.dmz.go.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.9165529096\nlongitude: 126.6991949569\ntitle: Je3ttanggul-ro, Paju-si, Gyeonggi-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus] <br>\nFrom Seoul Station, take Bus No. 909 and get off at Munsan Jongjeom Bus Stop. <BR>Transfer to Bus No. 058 and get off at Imjingak Resort Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-09-09-1662709464827","title":"The 3rd Tunnel (Dorasan Observatory) (Ï†ú3ÎïÖÍµ¥)","description":"The 3rd Tunnel was discovered by South Korea in 1978.

These rocks are basaltic, and are commonly called gombo (a face with chicken pox marks) rock because they are covered with small holes that form from air bubbles when volcanic lava cools rapidly. The surrounding scenery of the Hantangang River area is truly breathtaking and is also the site of a famous amusement park. The Hantangang River Resort, located in the lower region of the Hantangang River, stretches along 1.5 kilometers of the river's shore between the Saranggyo Bridge and the Hantangyo Bridge in Jeongok-ri, Yeoncheon-gun. The Hantangang River flows from the Pyeonggang River in North Korea and through through Cheorwon, Pocheon and Yeoncheon and eventually joins the Imjingang River. The river features many scenic points including a large valley with cliffs that consist of many rare rocks. The resort is a great place for rest and relaxation, and has facilities for the whole family, maintaining campsites for cars and motor homes, a dinosaur-themed Children‚Äôs Character Park, Children‚Äôs Transportation Land, a water park, an ecological pond, and a soccer field. Additionally, the Goseokjeong Pavilion and Sundam Valley are located nearby upstream.","regDate":"2022-09-15","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Tourist Complexes"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-15-1663223162380/2431947_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-09-15-1663223162380"},{"id":"2022-09-15-1663218185847","title":"Gwangju Gonjiam Ceramic Park (Í¥ëÏ£º Í≥§ÏßÄÏïîÎèÑÏûêÍ≥µÏõê)","description":"Located in Sam-ri, Gwangju in Gyeonggi-do, Gwangju Gonjiam Ceramic Park is largely comprised of a historic site from the Old Stone Age Era.
