Local folklore has it that those coming to the mountain wishing for true love will have their dreams come true.  \n<br><br>\nThe soil of Mount Yeoninsan is fertile, offering a great natural environment for a variety of flowers and trees. Numerous types of wild flowers thrive from early spring to late autumn. The trail connecting Mount Yeoninsan with mounts Myeongjisan, Cheonggyesan, and Gwimokbong remains relatively unspoiled by human influence: cooking and camping in the area is strictly forbidden. All the mountains in the trail are over 1,000 meters high. A defining feature of Mount Yeoninsan is the royal azaleas that bloom in late May. The County of Gapyeong celebrates the royal azalea by hosting the Mount Yeoninsan (Natural Ecology) Festival in May of each year.  \n<br><br>\nAlso ideal for hiking, Mount Yeoninsan offers a number of trails: one starts from Buk-myeon in Baekdun-ri, one from Mail-ri, and one from Yongchu Valley. With a minimum of climbing, hikers can take in a variety of scenic views, ranging from the bloom of the royal azaleas in the spring to the beauty of the changing leaves in the fall.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-31-8008-8140|\n|restdate:|Mondays|\n|usetime:|[Information Center]<br>10:00-17:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Hiking Course:|* Baekdun-ri (백둔리) Course<br>1) Baekdun Yeoningyo bridge  → Chowu (초우) rest area → Jangsu Waterfalls (장수폭포) → Somang (소망) ridge → Peak (5.14km, 3hours)<br>2) Baekdun Yeoningyo bridge  → Chowu rest area → Jangsu hill → Jangsu ridge → Peak (6.5km, 3 .5 hours)<br><br>* Seungan-ri (승안리) Course<br>1) The last stop of Youngchu Bus → Official's Rest home → Kalbong (칼봉) cabin → Cheongpung (청풍) ridge → Peak (9km, 4.5 hours)<br>2) The last stop of Youngchu Bus → Official's Rest home → Kalbong cabin → Yeonin (연인) ridge → Peak (11.76km. 5.5 hours)<br><br>* Mail-ri (마일리) / Sangpan-ri (상판리) Wujeong (우정, friendship) ridge Course<br>1) The last stop of Mail-ri Bus (Guksudang, 국수당) → Wujeong hill → Wujeong ridge → Wujeongbong peak → Peak(6.15km, 3 hours)<br>2) Sangpan-ri → The Enterance of Jeiwon → Ridge → Helicopter pad → Peak (4.15km, 2 hours 40 mins)|\n|Mountain Not Access Period:|Seasonal Forest Fire Watches<br>Spring: March 2-April 30 <br>Autumn: November 1-December 15<brNational Park: November 15-December 15 (Excluding Gyeongju and Taean)<br>* Periods and areas are subject to change based on fire weather advisories, snow/precipitation levels, and other local conditions.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Korean Info.

These rocks are basaltic, and are commonly called gombo (a face with chicken pox marks) rock because they are covered with small holes that form from air bubbles when volcanic lava cools rapidly. The surrounding scenery of the Hantangang River area is truly breathtaking and is also the site of a famous amusement park. The Hantangang River Resort, located in the lower region of the Hantangang River, stretches along 1.5 kilometers of the river's shore between the Saranggyo Bridge and the Hantangyo Bridge in Jeongok-ri, Yeoncheon-gun. The Hantangang River flows from the Pyeonggang River in North Korea and through through Cheorwon, Pocheon and Yeoncheon and eventually joins the Imjingang River. The river features many scenic points including a large valley with cliffs that consist of many rare rocks. The resort is a great place for rest and relaxation, and has facilities for the whole family, maintaining campsites for cars and motor homes, a dinosaur-themed Children’s Character Park, Children’s Transportation Land, a water park, an ecological pond, and a soccer field. Additionally, the Goseokjeong Pavilion and Sundam Valley are located nearby upstream.","regDate":"2022-09-15","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Tourist Complexes"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-15-1663223162380/2431947_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-09-15-1663223162380"},{"id":"2022-09-15-1663218185847","title":"Gwangju Gonjiam Ceramic Park (광주 곤지암도자공원)","description":"Located in Sam-ri, Gwangju in Gyeonggi-do, Gwangju Gonjiam Ceramic Park is largely comprised of a historic site from the Old Stone Age Era.
