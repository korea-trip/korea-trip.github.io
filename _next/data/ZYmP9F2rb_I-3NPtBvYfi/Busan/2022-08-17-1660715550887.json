On July 1, 2004, the park once again made the news, as the entrance fee was abolished and the park was made free to the public. In addition to typical sports facilities like badminton court, fitness center, and exercise amenities, the park also offers fun rides such as rope way (cable car) and pirate ship. Visitors are also encouraged to stop by tourist sites such as Busan Folk Tradition Arts Center, Busan Marine Natural History Museum, and Busan Botanical Garden.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-51-860-7880|\n|parking:|Use a public parking lot nearby|\n|usetime:|[Geumgang Rope Way (Cable Car)] 09:00-17:30<br>[Busan Marine Natural History Museum] 09:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Available Facilities:|[Recreational facilities]<br>‚Äì Geumgang Park Rope Way (cable car) <br>- Recreational facilities<br> <br>[Educational facilities]<br> - Busan Folk Art Museum<br> - Busan Marine Natural History Museum<br> - Geumgang Botanical Garden <br><br>[Facilities]<br>- Exercise equipment|\n|Parking Fees:|[First 10 min]<br>Large-sized cars 600 won / Mid-sized cars 400 won / Small-sized cars 200 won<br>[After 10 min] Charged for every additional 10 minutes<br>Large-sized cars 600 won / Mid-sized cars 400 won / Small-sied cars 200 won<br>[1-Day Parking (more than 4 hours)]<br>Small/Mid-sized cars 4,700 won / Large-sized cars depending on the size<br><br>* Mid-sized - 15~37 passengers / Large-sized - Bus|\n|Facility Utilization Fees:|[Cable Car Rope Way]<br> Adults & Teenagers - Round-trip 9,000 won / One-way 6,000 won <br> Children (age 4 to elementary school students) - Round-trip 6,000 won / One-way 4,000 won <br> Senior citizens (ages 65 & older) - Round-trip 7,000 won / One-way 5,000 won<br> <br> [Recreational Facilities]<br> Peter Pan - Adults & Teenagers 4,000 won  / Children 3,000 won<br> Viking - Adults & Teenagers 5,000 won  / Children 4,000 won<br> <br> [Geumgang Botanical Garden]<br> Individual - Adults 1,000 won  / Senior citizens & Teengers 800 won / Children 500 won <br> Group - Adults 800 won  / Senior citizens & Teengagers 500 won / Children 400 won|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-17-1660715550887/2641838_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-17-1660715550887/2641838_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-51-860-7880](tel:+82518607880)\n- [üè†geumgangpark.bisco.or.kr](http://geumgangpark.bisco.or.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.2190105271\nlongitude: 129.0762330134\ntitle: 155, Ujangchun-ro, Dongnae-gu, Busan\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-17-1660715550887","title":"Geumgang Park (Í∏àÍ∞ïÍ≥µÏõê)","description":"Located at the foot of Geumjeong Mountain (alt. 802 m), Geumgang Park stretches over a 3 million-square meter plot of land filled with lush forest and craggy cliffs and broken up by winding creeks.
