The lake and its surrounding mountains were designated a national tourist site in 1985, but remain historically significant as they are featured on Daedongyeojido (Grand Map of Korea), a revered document developed by geographer Kim Jeong-ho. Known for its beauty at night, the lake was befittingly dubbed “Eunpa,” which means “silvery moonlit waves.”<br><br>\n\nEupa Lake Park is full of natural beauty. The road that runs up from the park entrance is lined with cherry trees that create a breathtaking tunnel of pink flowers each spring. This stunning cherry blossom tunnel draws crowds of families and couples each year, particularly on the weekends. Mulbit Bridge, a landmark of the Eunpa tourist site, offers an impressive view of the Music Fountain and nightscape. At the park, you’ll also find an inline skating area, a waterfront stage, and a lotus flower garden.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-63-454-4896|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Available Facilities:|Outdoor stage, waterside stage, sports field, lotus flower deck, inline skating rinks, duck boat, music fountain, Mulbit Bridge, bike path, etc.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603759_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603759_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603761_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603761_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603762_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603762_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603764_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603764_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603765_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603765_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603766_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603766_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603767_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603767_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603768_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603768_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603769_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603769_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659299982539/176732_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659299982539/176732_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-63-454-4896](tel:+82634544896)\n- [🏠tour.gunsan.go.kr](http://tour.gunsan.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.9509492296\nlongitude: 126.6933626781\ntitle: Miryong-dong, Gunsan-si, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>From \nFrom Gunsan Intercity/Express Bus Terminal Bus Stop, take Bus No. 31, 32, 33, 34 or 38 and get \noff at Gungjeon Wedding Hall (Eunpa Recreation Area) Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-31-1659299982539","title":"Eunpa Lake Park (Eunpa Recreation Area) (은파호수공원(은파국민관광지))","description":"Located in Gunsan, Jeollabuk-do, Eunpa Lake Park was once a reservoir built before the Joseon dynasty that supplied water to nearby farms.

In the third year of King Chungsuk of Goryeo (1316), the temple saw the addition of a five-story stone pagoda, built by Monk Deokhyeon. At its peak, the temple was said to have had 12 hermitages and housed 1,000 monks. It was burned down during the Imjin War (1592-1598), leaving only the pagoda, but was rebuilt a few years later by Monk Soyo during the 37th year of King Seonjo (1604). Unfortunately, the temple was burned down again in the Korean War, but was once again restored to its original state in 1959. <br><br>Cultural assets found at the temple include Stone Guardian Post of Chungsin-ri & Namgye-ri, Sunchang Guesthouse, and the Three-story Stone Pagoda of Sunhwa-ri.
