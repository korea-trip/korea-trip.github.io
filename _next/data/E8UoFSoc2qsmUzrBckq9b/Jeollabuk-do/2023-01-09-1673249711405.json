In the third year of King Chungsuk of Goryeo (1316), the temple saw the addition of a five-story stone pagoda, built by Monk Deokhyeon. At its peak, the temple was said to have had 12 hermitages and housed 1,000 monks. It was burned down during the Imjin War (1592-1598), leaving only the pagoda, but was rebuilt a few years later by Monk Soyo during the 37th year of King Seonjo (1604). Unfortunately, the temple was burned down again in the Korean War, but was once again restored to its original state in 1959. <br><br>Cultural assets found at the temple include Stone Guardian Post of Chungsin-ri & Namgye-ri, Sunchang Guesthouse, and the Three-story Stone Pagoda of Sunhwa-ri.

Sin Jae-hyos House in Gochang was built in 1850, and visitors can observe sarangchae (main room), an old well, and a paulownia tree preserved to this day. Sin was not a singer himself but a pansori enthusiast, and he used wealth to train potential singers and contribute to the growth of pansori. He also compiled and edited six pansori madangs (operas) titled Ttoggi Taryeong, Bak Taryeong, Simcheongga, Jeokbyeokga, Chunhyangga, and Garujigi Taryeong, of which only five are passed down. To honor his contributions and passion for pansori, Dongni Gugakdang was founded behind this house.","regDate":"2023-01-09","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Old Houses"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-09-1673246392392/1954579_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-09-1673246392392","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-09-1673246392392"},{"id":"2023-01-09-1673242542457","title":"Seonunsan Mountain [National Geopark] (선운산 (전북 서해안 국가지질공원))","description":"Seonunsan Mountain is famous for its sunrise views at Nakjodae Overlook and Cheonmabong Peak.
