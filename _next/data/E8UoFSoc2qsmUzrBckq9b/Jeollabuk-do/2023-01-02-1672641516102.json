At its peak, the temple was said to have had 12 hermitages and housed 1,000 monks. It was burned down during the Imjin War (1592-1598), leaving only the pagoda, but was rebuilt a few years later by Monk Soyo during the 37th year of King Seonjo (1604). Unfortunately, the temple was burned down again in the Korean War, but was once again restored to its original state in 1959. <br><br>Cultural assets found at the temple include Stone Guardian Post of Chungsin-ri & Namgye-ri, Sunchang Guesthouse, and the Three-story Stone Pagoda of Sunhwa-ri.
