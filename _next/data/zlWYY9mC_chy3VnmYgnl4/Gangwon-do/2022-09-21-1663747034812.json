By entering the hiking trail of the falls, you will encounter a narrow and deep gorge. Formed through quartzitic jointing, the gorge has a mysterious atmosphere with its strange rocks and bizarre stones, which look sharp and precipitous. As the gorge and falls keep their cool temperature, the area is a popular summer resort. Deungseon Falls is one of the Eight Sights of Deungseon, along with Seunghak Falls, Baengnyeon Falls, and Biryong Falls. The quickest way to get to Deungseon Falls starts from the Deungseon Falls Ticket Booth, which is close to Gangchon.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-33-262-2215|\n|parking:|Available(100 vehicles)|\n|restdate:|Open year round|\n|usetime:|00:00–24:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|KRW 2,000|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-09-21-1663747034812/181845_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-21-1663747034812/181845_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-21-1663747034812/181847_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-21-1663747034812/181847_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-21-1663747034812/181848_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-21-1663747034812/181848_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-21-1663747034812/181846_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-21-1663747034812/181846_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-21-1663747034812/1842025_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-21-1663747034812/1842025_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-21-1663747034812/1842028_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-21-1663747034812/1842028_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-21-1663747034812/484686_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-21-1663747034812/484686_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-33-244-2331](tel:+82332442331)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.8260420693\nlongitude: 127.6596487065\ntitle: 1401-30, Gyeongchun-ro, Seo-myeon, Chuncheon-si, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Dong Seoul Bus Terminal to Chuncheon Intercity Bus Terminal, take an intercity bus.<br>\nAnd take Bus 51 and get off at Samaksan Mountain Bus Stop.<br> Walk 350m  along the trekking road to reach the valley.<br><br>\n[Train]<br>\nFrom Gangchon Station (ITX-train), take a taxi to the valley.
