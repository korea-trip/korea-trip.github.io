However, the cave was found to have natural stalactites, and was later developed into the only theme-based cave that combined gold and nature. The ticket booth and the caves entrance is located apart from each other, and visitors can either hike or ride on monorail to the entrance point. Hwaamdonggul Cave is not only a tourist attraction but also an educational venue where visitors can learn about the subterranean ecology of a stalactite cave and the process of gold mining and refining.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-33-560-2379|\n|parking:|Available (Large vehicles: 24 spaces / Small vehicles: 530 spaces)|\n|usetime:|09:00-17:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|[General]<br>Individuals - Adults 5,000 won / Teenagers 3,500 won / Children 2,000 won <br>Group - Adults 4,500 won / Teenagers 3,000 won / Children 1,500 won <br><br>* Free admission for preschoolers (ages 6 or younger) & senior citizens (ages 65 or older).
