Jeju has a year-round average temerature of 16‚ÑÉ and nutrient-rich soil with plenty of water for the tea plants to grow well. The two cave cafes, Evergreen Luce Garden and Eve Hall, serve naturally fermented green tea bread, cookies, muffins, green tea latte and green tea juice. <br><br>\n\nEvergreen Luce outdoor garden was built inside a cave formed naturally by a volcanic eruption. Despite being in a cave, this outdoor garden has ponds, bridges, indigenous trees and flowers. Eve Hall is located through a hole in the cave ceiling and can be only reached after passing through a tunnel-like cave. The deepest part of Eve Hall is roughly 30 meters and is home to bats; if you are lucky, you might even see a few.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-64-782-0005,<br> +82-64-784-9030|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|* Varies by season; please make an inquiry in advance.|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|* Varies by season; please make an inquiry in advance.|\n|Available Facilities:|Tea culture center, Daheeyeon restaurant, Gotjawal Cave, Cave Cafe, green tea field, Bille Pond, zipline, etc. |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Reservation Info. for Natives:|Advanced reservation required for experience programs.|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620105_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620105_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620106_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620106_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620107_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620107_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620109_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620109_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620110_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620110_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620111_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620111_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620112_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620112_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620113_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620113_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620114_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620114_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620115_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658241314969/1620115_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-64-782-0005](tel:+82647820005)\n- [üè†www.daheeyeon.com](http://www.daheeyeon.com/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.4871596654\nlongitude: 126.7061797858\ntitle: 117, Seongyo-ro, Jeju-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Local Bus]<br>\nFrom Jeju International Airport, take Bus No. 38 and get off at Jocheon-eup Gwannae/Seonin-dong Bus Stop.<br>\nTransfer to Bus No. 900 and get off at Gyeongdeokwon Bus Stop.<br><br>\n\n[Taxi]<br>\nApprox. 40 min from Jeju International Airport.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-19-1658241314969","title":"Daheeyeon Garden (Îã§Ìù¨Ïó∞)","description":"Daheeyeon Garden is a major tea farm on Jeju Island, which has the best conditions for growing great tea in a natural environment.

Created particularly close to the earth‚Äôs surface, this cave has a number of entrance holes to the tunnel. Inside, the complex structure of the cave unfolds in the form of double-tiered or triple-tiered rooms.

Legend has it that the pond was created by the water raining down off of a dragon that ascended to heaven.

When he fell down, his body immediately sank into the ocean and his head rapidly froze looking at the sky. Another legend has it that a white horse, who dreamed of being a dragon and ascending to the sky, came to be caught by a soldier and froze into the rock.<br><br>From Yongduam Rock, visitors can see haenyeo (female divers) working at catching seafood.

The deep Yeongsilgyegok Valley and vast rock walls could be the result of a large volcano entrance in the past. After passing Byeongpungbawi Rock, the path becomes relatively flat until Witsaeoruem Rest Area. The first attraction of Yeongsil is a group of volcanic rocks collectively called Yeongsilgiam. These oddly shaped rocks are situated to the right of a big valley at 1,400 meters to 1,600 meters above sea level, soaring upwards towards the sky.
