However, despite their wide appearance, a lack of historical documents has hampered the true understanding of the statues. Bukchon Dol Hareubang Park puts together a wide variety of the statutes and, in doing so, illuminates their aesthetic and scholarly importance to visitors as well as future generations. In this sense, the park is not only a tourist attraction, but also a learning center for children and adults alike. The park consists of 48 Dol Hareubang, a promenade, reinterpreted Dol Hareubang focusing on the theme of peace, a traditional local garden with walking paths, and a learning center.<br><br>\n\n Dol Hareubang were previously called by various names, including Useokmok, Museokmok, or Byeoksumeori. Dol Hareubang became the official name in 1971 after being designated as a local folk heritage. Although Dol Hareubang were originally seen only around the entrance of government seats, there are over 48 officially recognized Dol Hareubang throughout the island (21 in Jeju City, 2 in National Folk Museum of Korea, 12 in Seongeup, and 13 in Daejeong), along with many replicas. The shamanistic statues are believed to offer protection and ward off demons. According to Tamnaji (Record of Tamna), Dol Hareubang are believed to have been initiated by Kim Mong-gyu, then Magistrate of Jeju in 1754 (30th year of King Yeongjo‚Äôs reign).\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-64-782-0570|\n|parking:|Available|\n|usetime:|April-October 09:00-18:00<br>November-March 09:00-17:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Adults 6,000 won / Teenagers 4,000 won |\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620008_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620008_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620009_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620009_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620010_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620010_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620011_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620011_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620012_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620012_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620013_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620013_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620014_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620014_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620015_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620015_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-64-782-0570](tel:+82647820570)\n- [üè†www.visitjeju.net](https://www.visitjeju.net/kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.5396035971\nlongitude: 126.6896605755\ntitle: 70, Bukchonseo 1-gil, Jeju-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>\nFrom Jeju Bus Terminal take a local bus bound for Seongsan and get off at Bukchon Elementary School Bus Stop. <Br> Walk for approx. 700 m towards Hallasan Mountain.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-19-1658216050635","title":"Bukchon Dol Hareubang Park (Î∂ÅÏ¥å ÎèåÌïòÎ•¥Î∞©Í≥µÏõê)","description":"As a main symbol of Jeju Island, Dol Hareubang, literally meaning \"Old Grandfather\" stone statues, can be found everywhere on the island.

Created particularly close to the earth‚Äôs surface, this cave has a number of entrance holes to the tunnel. Inside, the complex structure of the cave unfolds in the form of double-tiered or triple-tiered rooms.

Legend has it that the pond was created by the water raining down off of a dragon that ascended to heaven.

There are many legends surrounding the rock. One legend has it that a dragon stealing precious jade from Hallasan Mountain was shot down by an arrow from the mountain deity. When he fell down, his body immediately sank into the ocean and his head rapidly froze looking at the sky. Another legend has it that a white horse, who dreamed of being a dragon and ascending to the sky, came to be caught by a soldier and froze into the rock.<br><br>From Yongduam Rock, visitors can see haenyeo (female divers) working at catching seafood.

It starts from Yeongsil Rest Area and follows a relatively gentle slope lined with beautiful trees and autumn foliage for about one kilometer.<br> After that, an uphill path emerges along steep mountain ridges. The deep Yeongsilgyegok Valley and vast rock walls could be the result of a large volcano entrance in the past. After passing Byeongpungbawi Rock, the path becomes relatively flat until Witsaeoruem Rest Area. The first attraction of Yeongsil is a group of volcanic rocks collectively called Yeongsilgiam. These oddly shaped rocks are situated to the right of a big valley at 1,400 meters to 1,600 meters above sea level, soaring upwards towards the sky. Pass by Sajebi Hill to get a glass of mineral spring water, and  reach Eorimok to take the path downwards.","regDate":"2023-02-14","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites","National Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-14-1676364076313/2617909_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-14-1676364076313"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
