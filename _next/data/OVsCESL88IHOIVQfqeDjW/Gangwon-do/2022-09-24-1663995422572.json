Geumdanggyegok Valley is an impressive site with sections of both gentle and fast flowing valley waters. From late March through April full-blown azalea covers the mountainsides and valleys providing visitors with a refreshing spring scent.  <br><br>To reach Geumdanggyegok Valley, travel down along the Pyeongchanggang River from Jangpyeong or trek up the valley from Anmi Elementary School. Coming down to Pyeongchang-eup from Daehwa-myeon area, visitors will encounter an intersection called, “Saechugeori”. The intersection has two parts  Sanganmi and Haanmiri and a sign indicating the Geumdanggyegok Valley entrance. Across the valley, odd-shaped rock formations and cliffs appear one after another along the river. The area is a native habitat for a species of otter (Natural Treasure No. 330) and a favorite spot for catching catfish.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-33-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-33-330-2771|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Hiking Course:|Geumdanggyegok Valley - Geumdangsan Mountain (1,173 m) (Approx. 1 hr 30 min)|\n|Tour Course Information:|* Geumdanggyegok Valley - Lee Hyo-seok Culture Village - Heungjeonggyegok Valley - Lee Seungbok Memorial Hall <br>* Geumdanggyegok Valley - Neounngyegok Valley - Noseongsan Mountain - Gihwagyegok Valley|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-09-24-1663995422572/1177173_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-24-1663995422572/1177173_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-24-1663995422572/1177178_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-24-1663995422572/1177178_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-24-1663995422572/1177190_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-24-1663995422572/1177190_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-24-1663995422572/1177193_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-24-1663995422572/1177193_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-24-1663995422572/1177200_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-24-1663995422572/1177200_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-24-1663995422572/1177241_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-24-1663995422572/1177241_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-24-1663995422572/1177244_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-24-1663995422572/1177244_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-24-1663995422572/1177247_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-24-1663995422572/1177247_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-24-1663995422572/1177255_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-24-1663995422572/1177255_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-24-1663995422572/1177238_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-24-1663995422572/1177238_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-33-330-2771](tel:+82333302771)\n- [🏠tour.pc.go.kr](http://tour.pc.go.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.4824623569\nlongitude: 128.3942007364\ntitle: 766-2, Geumdanggyegok-ro, Pyeongchang-gun, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \nFrom Dong \nSeoul Bus Terminal.<br>Take an intercity \nbus bound for Pyeongchang via&nbsp;Jangpyeong.<br>Get off at Jangpyeong.<br><br>From Jangpyeong \nTerminal, take a bus bound for Yupo-ri. <br>Bus schedule: 6 times per day/ travel \ntime: 20min.&nbsp;\n","data":{"id":"2022-09-24-1663995422572","title":"Geumdanggyegok Valley (금당계곡)","description":"Geumdanggyegok Valley, located upstream of the Pyeongchanggang River, is a gorge between three different districts of Bongpyeong-myeon, Yongpyeong-myeon and Daehwa-myeon, just west of Geumdangsan Mountain (1,173 m).
