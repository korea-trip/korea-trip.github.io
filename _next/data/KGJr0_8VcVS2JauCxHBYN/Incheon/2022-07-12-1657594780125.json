In the past, the island was called Ijeokdo Island because it served as a hideout for pirates. The sea, mountain, and shoal exist in harmony.<br>\n<br>\n The beauty of Daeijakdo Island comes from the view of the blue ocean from the peak of Buasan Mountain and the shoal that only appears during low tide. The shoal almost reaches Soijakdo Island and creates a large field of sand. The shoal is also called <em>pulchi</em> and only appears during low tide for six hours a day.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-32-851-888|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-12-1657594780125/2661904_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-12-1657594780125/2661904_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-12-1657594780125/2661906_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-12-1657594780125/2661906_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-12-1657594780125/2661907_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-12-1657594780125/2661907_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-12-1657594780125/2661908_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-12-1657594780125/2661908_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-32-851-888](tel:+8232851888)\n- [üè†daeijakdo.kr](http://daeijakdo.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.1749176125\nlongitude: 126.2587835301\ntitle: Ijak-ri, Ongjin-gun, Incheon\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Ferry]<br>\nTake a ferry from Incheon Passenger Port Terminal to the island.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-12-1657594780125","title":"Daeijakdo Island (ÎåÄÏù¥ÏûëÎèÑ)","description":"Ijakdo Island is made up of Daeijakdo Island and Soijakdo Island.

The film set, however, was demolished after the shooting. The pathway to the island, which has no residents, can be shown during low tide. Therefore, visitors should be aware of the tidal times to know when they can cross back to the mainland.","regDate":"2022-08-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-12-1660280190872/190690_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-08-12-1660280190872"},{"id":"2022-08-12-1660277185177","title":"Seonnyeo Rock (ÏÑ†ÎÖÄÎ∞îÏúÑ)","description":"Seonnyeo Rock is located near the Seoul metropolitan area, in the northern part of Yongyudo Island, past Masian Beach.

The beach is also popular among tourists at sunset, when the fading sun colors the sea around the rock.<br> On the other side is a small dock and old fishing boats. This beach is less crowded than Wangsan Beach or those in Eurwang-ri, making it the perfect spot for swimming and camping. <br> There is a pretty cafe up the hill from the rock and it is a great place for enjoying the ocean scenery with a cup of tea. On the other side of the cafe is a garden with pine trees, yet another beautiful spot to watch the sunset.","regDate":"2022-08-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Nature","Natural Resources","Rocks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-12-1660277185177/1826990_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-08-12-1660277185177"},{"id":"2022-08-12-1660271887021","title":"Seongmodo Island (ÏÑùÎ™®ÎèÑ)","description":"Seongmodo Island, located 1.2 kilometers west of Ganghwado Island, is a popular destination for families and those looking for relaxation.
