The theme park provides children with a chance to experience jobs that they might want to have when they grow up! Job experiences include working as a policeman, flight attendant, firefighter, or chef (uniforms are provided). When you work hard in Kidzania, you get paid in Kidzo (a virtual currency). You can put your money in the bank for your next visit or purchase goods at the department store. In order to make the environment as realistic as possible, every building, car, and tree is reduced to 2/3 its real size, helping children feel more adult-like in their new world! Kidzania mimics a real city environment, has diverse jobs, and is full of events. When there is a fire, a fireman rushes to help, and a news reporter covers the story. While 911 paramedics give first aid to fire victims, in another part of ‚Äútown‚Äù delivery personnel are dropping off packages. Kidzania teaches the next generation how to live as responsible members of society and gives them an introduction to how the economy works.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-1544-5110|\n|opendate:|February 27, 2010|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)<br>* Subject to closure; refer to the website for details|\n|usetime:|Session 1 10:00-15:00 <br>Session 2 15:00-19:30<br>All-day pass (Session 1 & 2) 10:00-19:30|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Film Locations:|Various variety shows|\n|Available Facilities:|[Experience facilities]<br>Bank, acting school, driving tracks, fire emergency department, flower atelier, extreme climbing, voice recording studio, hospital, robotics laboratory, photo studio, TV studio, police station, radio studio, magic school, and more. <br><br>[Convenience facilities]<br>Information center, storage lockers, lost and found, nurse office, parents lounge, nursery, etc.<BR><BR>[Restaurants &  others]<BR>Kidzania Cafeteria, multishop, Airshop, National Store, Kid's Corner, Snow Town, Candy Shop, Smoothie King, Lotteria, etc.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|Children: Session 1 42,000 won / Session 2 38,000 won / All-day pass 61,000 won<br>Guardian: Session 1 19,000 won / Session 2 17,000 won / All-day pass 20,000 won <br>3-Hour Ticket - Children 25,000 won / Guardian 11,000 won<br>(Session 1 - Admission after 12:00 / Session 2 - Admission after 16:30)<br><br>* Children (ages 3-16) / Guardian (ages 17 and older)<br>* Children below 10 years old must be accompanied by a guardian<br>* Guardians are not allowed to enter without accompanying a child<br>* Babies (ages 3 or younger): Free admission (participation in hands-on programs not allowed)|\n|Parking Fees:|Weekdays - First 3 hours free / 3,000 won charged for additional 3 hours<br>Weekends & public holidays: First 3 hours free / 11,200 won charged for additional 3 hours<br />* Guests using Lotte World parking lot can apply for 3 free hours at the Kidzania information desk.|\n|Reservation Info. for Foreigners:|Tickets can be purchased on-site|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-04-1659656133025/2031376_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659656133025/2031376_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659656133025/2031379_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659656133025/2031379_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659656133025/2031381_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659656133025/2031381_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659656133025/2031382_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659656133025/2031382_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-1544-5110](tel:+8215445110)\n- [üè†www.kidzania.co.kr](http://www.kidzania.co.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5110683960\nlongitude: 127.0981394766\ntitle: 240, Olympic-ro, Songpa-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway]<br>\nJamsil Station (Seoul Subway Line 2), Exit 4.<br>\nGo straight 300m towards Lotte World.<br>\nTurn left in front of the outdoor parking lot to arrive at the Kidzania.\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-04-1659656133025","title":"Kidzania Seoul (ÌÇ§ÏûêÎãàÏïÑ ÏÑúÏö∏)","description":"Kidzania, located in Jamsil, Songpa-gu, Seoul, is a unique family entertainment space especially for children ages 3 to 16.

Originally known as ‚ÄúGondanggol Church,‚Äù the church was established by Samuel Foreman Moore (1860-1906) in 1893. In those days, the church was known as a ‚Äúbaekjeong church‚Äù since it primarily drew Korea‚Äôs social underdogs such baekjeong (the butchers), the untouchable class of Joseon society. <br><br>Following a number of relocations and name changes (called ‚ÄúGondanggol,‚Äù ‚ÄúJungang,‚Äù and finally ‚ÄúSeungdong‚Äù) the church was moved to its current location in Insadong. After Moore died in 1906, Charles Allen Clark became the pastor of the church and Mongyang Yuh Woon-hyung, a key figure in the political history of Joseon, became active in the church. The church was attended by many other activists as well. In fact, the large student demonstration that took place during the March 1st Independence Movement in 1919 was organized by a group of young church members. The church once again made its mark on history with the establishment of the Joseon Theological Seminary in 1939. <br><br>Seungdong Church (B1-2F) covers a total of 660 square meters. No record has been found on its architect or builder, but the building is said to have been one of the more magnificent buildings in the area before its beauty was obscured by newer structures.","regDate":"2022-08-09","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Holy Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-09-1660070701249/1568421_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-08-09-1660070701249"},{"id":"2022-08-09-1660066859091","title":"Seoullo 7017 (ÏÑúÏö∏Î°ú 7017)","description":"In the 1970s, an elevated road was built to connect the eastern and western sides around Seoul Station. However, the road was closed to road traffic due to safety issues. After this, rather than tearing down the existing structure, the road was transformed into Seoullo 7017, a new pedestrian road attraction. <br><br>Seoullo 7017 gets its name from the numbers that represents its transformation, from being a traffic road in the '70s to a sky garden in 2017. The 17 also has a deeper meaning, with Seoullo 7017 being divided into 17 unique sections, and the road being located 17 meters above the ground.<br><br> There are a variety of facilities along Seoullo 7017, including an information center, cafes, gardens, and stages.

In 1891, Myeongdong Cathedral's head priest Doucet laid down the foundation stone in Hap-dong. Coadjutor bishop Coste was in charge of design and construction and the building was eventually completed in 1892. The church was named after Yakjeonhyeon, or a hill of medicinal herbs. This is because the place where the church is located was once a hilly area covered with medicinal herbs. Later on, Yakjeonhyeon was shortened to Yakhyeon and it became the name of the hilly area between Malli-dong and Seoul Station.<br><br>Yakhyeon Catholic Church was the first Western-style church ever built in Korea.

It was impossible to determine the full scale of the ancient tombs in this area due to the severity of destruction. The largest tomb, the third tomb, measures 49.6 meters from east to west, 43.7 meters from south to north, and 4 meters in x_height. The tomb features three layers of stones topped by a smooth mound, which is a tomb style originating from the Goguryeo dynasty (37 BC-AD 668). The tombs are presumed to belong to one of the earliest leaders of the Baekje dynasty (18 BC-AD 660), which was founded by the people of Goguryeo who had come down southwards to establish a new kingdom around the Hangang River basin. <br><br>The square-shaped fourth tomb features a structure similar to the third tomb. Many pieces of earthenware from the early Baekje era were found in the fourth tomb. Also excavated around this site was a gold spangle earring. The third and fourth tombs have been registered as Historic Site No. 243. The tomb site offers valuable information concerning the culture and customs of the Baekje dynasty in its golden age around the 4th century, as well as the relations between the three ancient kingdoms (Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla) around that time.","regDate":"2022-08-09","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-09-1660055975519/203889_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-08-09-1660055975519"},{"id":"2022-08-09-1660053732378","title":"Seoul Sajik Park (ÏÇ¨ÏßÅÍ≥µÏõê(ÏÑúÏö∏))","description":"Sajik Park is one of the three most popular parks in Jongno-gu along with Tapgol Park and Samcheong Park.
