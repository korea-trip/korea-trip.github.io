The soft, white sand and lush pine trees also make this an ideal beach to visit for a walk. Various accommodations can easily be found here since the area has been a popular tourist destination for quite some time.<br><br>Located south of Daecheon Beach, Muchangpo Beach is where visitors can witness a sea-parting phenomenon in the summer.
