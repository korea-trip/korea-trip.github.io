Rock art from the time period was created on rocks or other planes considered to be sacred and usually carried a message of fertility. The artwork of Yangjeondong shows layered circles (symbolizing the sun and the moon), crosses (depicting the “life zone” of the tribe), and 17 masks. The artwork is considered to have been used for ceremonial purposes or farming events.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-54-955-2201|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-25-1669372785361/1004045_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-25-1669372785361/1004045_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-25-1669372785361/2493151_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-25-1669372785361/2493151_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-25-1669372785361/2493154_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-25-1669372785361/2493154_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-25-1669372785361/2493155_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-25-1669372785361/2493155_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-25-1669372785361/2493156_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-25-1669372785361/2493156_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-25-1669372785361/2493157_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-25-1669372785361/2493157_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-25-1669372785361/2493158_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-25-1669372785361/2493158_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-25-1669372785361/2493263_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-25-1669372785361/2493263_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.7128155575\nlongitude: 128.2921603954\ntitle: 15-5, Araealteo-gil, Goryeong-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus + Taxi]<BR>\nFrom Goryeong Bus Terminal, take a taxi to Yangjeondong Rock Art. <br><br>OR, <br>Take a local bus bound for Gaejin and get off at Hayangjeon Bus Stop.<br>Walk for approx. 600m\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-25-1669372785361","title":"Goryeong Janggi-ri Rock Art (고령 장기리 암각화)","description":"Yangjeondong Rock Art (discovered in 1971) is a rock painting 3 meters high and 5.5 meters wide that vividly depicts the life and religion of the Prehistoric Age.
