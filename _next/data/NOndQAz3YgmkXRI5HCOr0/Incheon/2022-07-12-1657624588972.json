The fortress was built in 1656 and the outpost was constructed in 1679. It was completely remodeled into a masonry castle with gates in 1745. During Sinmiyangyo (the American invasion in 1871), Gwangseongbo was the fiercest battle ground in Ganghwa. On April 24, 1871, a  fleet with 1,230 American naval forces led by Rear Admiral John Rodgers landed on Ganghwado Island to demand the opening of Korea's ports and commerce. The armed forces attacked Chojijin Fortress and Deokjinjin Camp, then marched to Gwangseongbo Fortress, where they engaged in close combat with the warriors of Joseon. Although General Eo Jae-yeon and the other warriors were poorly equipped with far inferior weapons, they bravely fought to the death against the invading forces. <br><br>The battlefield ruins of the fortress and the gate towers such as Anhaeru, Gwangseongdon, Sondolmokdon, and Yongdudon were repaired in 1977.  The twin tombs of General Eo Jae-Yeon and his brother Eo Jae-seon, along with the anonymous tombs of warriors who died on the battlefield were also honorably arranged at the same time. Furthermore, a stone monument commemorating the restoration of Ganghwa Battlefield was erected on Yongdudondae Post. <br><br>In 1988, an extensive rest area was created toward the shore for visitors‚Äô convenience. Gwangseongbo Fortress is presently designated as Historical Relic No. 227. A religious service known as Gwangseongje is held annually to commemorate the patriotic spirits of General Eo Jae-yeon and other unnamed warriors. This service takes place at 11 a.m. on every April 24th of the lunar calendar.","regDate":"2022-08-11","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-11-1660196262031/2363682_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-08-11-1660196262031"},{"id":"2022-08-11-1660193458113","title":"Gureopdo Island (Íµ¥ÏóÖÎèÑ)","description":"Gureopdo Island is considered the Galapagos of Korea.

The monk picked the lotus flower petals and blew them into the air. He then built a temple where each of the petals had landed, naming the temples according to their corresponding color  Jeokseoksa Temple, formerly Jeokryeonsa Temple (red lotus), Baengnyeonsa Temple (white lotus), Cheongryeonsa Temple (blue lotus), Hwangryeonsa Temple (yellow lotus), and Heungnyeonsa Temple (black lotus). <br><br>Around 130 dolmens are distributed along the foot of Goryeosan Mountain.

In the 19th year of his reign, King Gojong moved the capital to Ganghwa on account of its natural and strategic advantages. During the Byeongjahoran (Chinese invasion of Korea) in 1637, the palace was lost by force to the Qing dynasty of China. Later, Joseon Dynasty palace building and Ganghwa Yusubu (Ganghwa governor‚Äôs office) buildings existed in the Goryeo palace site but were destroyed by the French army during the Byeonginyangyo (French Campaign against Korea). Nowadays, the only structures that remain are the Dongheon main office (built in 1638) and Ibangcheong administration office (built in 1654). The palace and its subsidiary buildings were restored in 1977. It has historical lessons of the spirit of independence and overcoming national crisis.","regDate":"2022-08-11","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-11-1660185152853/1575652_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-08-11-1660185152853"},{"id":"2022-08-10-1660174693655","title":"Geojampo Beach (Í±∞Ïû†Ìè¨Ìï¥Î≥Ä)","description":"Although Geojampo beach is on the west coast, the estuary is facing the east allowing for a great view of the sunset and sunrise.
