The water is clear and clean, and a pine forest surrounds the white sandy beach. The beach is 8 kilometers long and 100 meters wide. In addition, the water level is only 1-2 meters deep and the slope is gentle, making it a suitable summer atraction for families with children. The sandy beach is characterized by its thick grain which is good for sand baths and does not stick to the body. <br><br> Daejin Beach also has a 200 meter-wide stream called Songcheoncheon Stream that flows across the white sandy beach. Visitors can enjoy a fresh water bath in the stream. Furthermore, since this stream is where the freshwater and seawater meet, visitors can enjoy both freshwater fishing and sea fishing. <br><br> In general, the eastern coastline is known to be monotonous, but the coastal bay of Chuksan-myeon is an exception. The mountain area is adjacent to the coast, and Jukdosan Mountain draws a complex coastline. The scenery of Jukdosan Mountain with its lush bamboo forest creates a beautiful painting. In addition, the coastal road from Chuksan 1-ri to Daejin Beach is great for enjoying a drive, and the scenery of white waves rolling over the golden sandy beach is beautiful.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-54-730-7721|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Shower booth, restaurants, accommodations, parasol, convenience store,  etc.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-22-1669099517214/575979_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-22-1669099517214/575979_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-22-1669099517214/583661_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-22-1669099517214/583661_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-22-1669099517214/583677_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-22-1669099517214/583677_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-22-1669099517214/634667_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-22-1669099517214/634667_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-22-1669099517214/634670_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-22-1669099517214/634670_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-22-1669099517214/634677_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-22-1669099517214/634677_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-22-1669099517214/634679_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-22-1669099517214/634679_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-22-1669099517214/634681_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-22-1669099517214/634681_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-22-1669099517214/782597_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-22-1669099517214/782597_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-22-1669099517214/575978_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-22-1669099517214/575978_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-54-730-7721](tel:+82547307721)\n- [üè†tour.yd.go.kr](http://tour.yd.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.5645374176\nlongitude: 129.4266915867\ntitle: 2840, Yeongdeokdaege-ro, Yeongdeok-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-22-1669099517214","title":"Daejin Beach (ÎåÄÏßÑÌï¥ÏàòÏöïÏû•)","description":"Daejin Beach is located in Daejin-ri, a coastal village in Yeonghae-myeon, Yeongdeok-gun, and has all the conditions for a coastal attraction.

The name of the mountain on which the temple was built was originally called Gongdeoksan, but was later known as Sabulsan. The name, Sabulsan, (meaning ‚ÄúFour Buddhas‚Äù) comes from the legend of the Silla Period in which a large stone shrouded with red silk and etched with four faces of Buddha mysteriously descended upon the mountain. Upon hearing the news of this miraculous event, the king at the time (King Jinpyeong) immediately visited the spot and had the temple built next to the sacred stone.<br><br>The temple was partially destroyed by fire in the summer of 1922, but was restored in 1927 thanks to the efforts of Monks Uiun, Chwiwol, and Deoksan. In January 1958, the temple once again suffered fire damage, leaving only a few buildings (Geukrakjeon, Myeongbujeon, and Sansingak) untouched. Monks Daehyu, Seolwol, and Jeongam helped to restore the temple and the temple has remained well-preserved ever since.","regDate":"2022-12-03","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-03-1670045778020/1967495_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-03-1670045778020"},{"id":"2022-12-03-1670042423588","title":"Mangyangjeong Pavilion (ÎßùÏñëÏ†ï)","description":"Mangyangjeong Pavilion is a beautiful wooden architecture located near Mangyang Beach in Sanpo-ri, Uljin.
