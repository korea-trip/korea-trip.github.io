{"pageProps":{"content":"![Manghaesa Temple (ÎßùÌï¥ÏÇ¨)](/2023-01-06-1672979958647/2675611_image2_1.webp)\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> Manghaesa Temple is located at the edge of the Gimje Plains before the sea. The temple stands at the summit of Jinbongsan Mountain.  The temple was named for the view of the ocean and the fields of rice. The temple was established by the great monk Buseol Geosa during the 2nd year of King Uija of Baekje (AD 642). Years later, Dobeopsa (a Chinese monk from the Tang dynasty) renovated the temple. The temple was altered again during the reign of King Injo of the Joseon dynasty when the great monk Jinmuk Daesa built Nakseojeon Hall in 1589. Bogwangjeon Hall and Chilseonggak Pavilion were built much later in 1933. Manghaesa Temple is unique in that it is the only temple where the distant horizon is visible over both land and sea. Nearby attractions include a walking path through a field of reeds by Mangyeonggang River and views of the sunset over the sea.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-63-540-3324|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|[Temple grounds] 05:00 - Sunset<br>[Observatory & Walking trail] Open 24 hr|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Not available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-06-1672979958647/176749_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-06-1672979958647/176749_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-06-1672979958647/1603990_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-06-1672979958647/1603990_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-06-1672979958647/1603991_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-06-1672979958647/1603991_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-06-1672979958647/1603993_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-06-1672979958647/1603993_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-06-1672979958647/1603995_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-06-1672979958647/1603995_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-06-1672979958647/2675608_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-06-1672979958647/2675608_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-06-1672979958647/2675610_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-06-1672979958647/2675610_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-63-540-3324](tel:+82635403324)\n- [üè†http://www.gimje.go.kr/tour/board/view.gimje?boardId=BBS_0000080&menuCd=DOM_000000403003000000&paging=ok&startPage=1&searchType=DATA_TITLE&searchOperation=AND&keyword=%EB%A7%9D%ED%95%B4%EC%82%AC&dataSid=120428](http://www.gimje.go.kr/tour/board/view.gimje?boardId=BBS_0000080&menuCd=DOM_000000403003000000&paging=ok&startPage=1&searchType=DATA_TITLE&searchOperation=AND&keyword=%EB%A7%9D%ED%95%B4%EC%82%AC&dataSid=120428)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.8597239049\nlongitude: 126.7156797015\ntitle: 94, Simpo 10-gil, Gimje-si, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>\nFrom Gimje Bus Terminal, take Bus No. 18, 19, or 19-1 bound for Simpo or Geojeon-ri and get off at Manghaesa Temple Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-06-1672979958647","title":"Manghaesa Temple (ÎßùÌï¥ÏÇ¨)","description":"Manghaesa Temple is located at the edge of the Gimje Plains before the sea.

The tunnel is approximately 3 meters in x_height and 10 meters in length, and divides the villages of Sindu Maeul into Dugil-ri, Seolcheon-myeon and Inam Maeul in Socheon-ri. During the Three Kingdoms Period, the rocky ridges of Seokgyeonsan Mountain drew the boundary of Sillas Mupung in the east with Baekjes Seolcheo to the west. <br>Tracing the history from the Three Kingdoms Period to the Goryeo dynasty, the cultures and traditions of the two regions were markedly different. If curious about the difference, one could simply stop by Seolcheon on market day, where the Muju and Mupung local dialects and customs can easily be distinguished. <br><br>People used to cross Seokgyeonsan Mountain by a footpath along the rocky ridge to travel between Seolcheon and Mupung. During the Japanese occupation, a new road was created by turning a cave into a tunnel through the mountain so cows and horse carts could freely pass from Muju to Gimcheon. <br><br>General Kim Yoo Shin from the Silla Kingdom, the hero of unification of the Three Kingdoms, often passed by the gate, later giving rise to the gates nickname, Tongilmun (literally Unification Gate). The gate is number one on the list of 33 scenic sites in Gucheon-dong.","regDate":"2023-01-08","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Nature","Natural Resources","Rocks"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-08-1673167020129/2366378_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-08-1673167020129"},{"id":"2023-01-08-1673163317005","title":"Omokdae and Imokdae Historic Sites (Ïò§Î™©ÎåÄÏôÄ Ïù¥Î™©ÎåÄ)","description":"Omokdae Historic Site is located on top of a steep hill and is one of the places where Yi Seong-gye, who later became King Taejo, the first king of the Joseon dynasty, stopped to celebrate his victory on his way home from a war against the Japanese army at Unbong Peak of Hwangsan Mountain.
