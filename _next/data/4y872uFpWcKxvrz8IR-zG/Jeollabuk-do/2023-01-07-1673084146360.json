The temple was established because of the theory of divination, based on topology. The belief held that Korea‚Äôs good spirit would be taken away to Japan, bringing bad luck if the temple was not constructed at this particular location. The temple was reconstructed in the 26th year of King Sukjong‚Äôs reign (1700) after it was completely destroyed during the Imjin War (1592-1598). However, it was almost burnt down in the 19th year of King Gojong‚Äôs reign (1882).<br> <br>It is presently preserved just as it was during the Unified Silla Kingdom, with its three-story pagoda and its 11 treasures with a total of 17 cultural assets. The entrance of the temple lies in the middle of a rice field and the temple has a pastoral view, surrounded by trees. From the entrance, visitors can cross the half-moon shaped stone bridge to find a remarkable totem pole.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-63-636-3031|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 1,500 won / Teenagers 1,200 won / Children 800 won<br>Groups - Adults 1,300 won / Teenagers 1,000 won / Children 700 won<br><br>* Group: 30 people or more|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Not available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-07-1673084146360/1604038_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-07-1673084146360/1604038_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-07-1673084146360/1604039_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-07-1673084146360/1604039_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-07-1673084146360/1604041_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-07-1673084146360/1604041_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-07-1673084146360/1604042_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-07-1673084146360/1604042_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-07-1673084146360/1604043_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-07-1673084146360/1604043_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-63-636-3031](tel:+82636363031)\n- [üè†www.silsangsa.or.kr</a><br><a href=\"https://www.templestay.com/temple_info.asp?t_id=silsangsa\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"web\">www.templestay.com](http://www.silsangsa.or.kr/ )\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.4167734048\nlongitude: 127.6347040606\ntitle: 94-129, Ipseok-gil, Namwon-si, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-07-1673084146360","title":"Namwon Silsangsa Temple (Ïã§ÏÉÅÏÇ¨(ÎÇ®Ïõê))","description":"Silsangsa Temple was constructed by Monk Jeunggak, as one of nine special temples in the year 828.

The tunnel is approximately 3 meters in x_height and 10 meters in length, and divides the villages of Sindu Maeul into Dugil-ri, Seolcheon-myeon and Inam Maeul in Socheon-ri. During the Three Kingdoms Period, the rocky ridges of Seokgyeonsan Mountain drew the boundary of Sillas Mupung in the east with Baekjes Seolcheo to the west. <br>Tracing the history from the Three Kingdoms Period to the Goryeo dynasty, the cultures and traditions of the two regions were markedly different. If curious about the difference, one could simply stop by Seolcheon on market day, where the Muju and Mupung local dialects and customs can easily be distinguished. <br><br>People used to cross Seokgyeonsan Mountain by a footpath along the rocky ridge to travel between Seolcheon and Mupung. During the Japanese occupation, a new road was created by turning a cave into a tunnel through the mountain so cows and horse carts could freely pass from Muju to Gimcheon. <br><br>General Kim Yoo Shin from the Silla Kingdom, the hero of unification of the Three Kingdoms, often passed by the gate, later giving rise to the gates nickname, Tongilmun (literally Unification Gate). The gate is number one on the list of 33 scenic sites in Gucheon-dong.","regDate":"2023-01-08","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Nature","Natural Resources","Rocks"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-08-1673167020129/2366378_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-08-1673167020129"},{"id":"2023-01-08-1673163317005","title":"Omokdae and Imokdae Historic Sites (Ïò§Î™©ÎåÄÏôÄ Ïù¥Î™©ÎåÄ)","description":"Omokdae Historic Site is located on top of a steep hill and is one of the places where Yi Seong-gye, who later became King Taejo, the first king of the Joseon dynasty, stopped to celebrate his victory on his way home from a war against the Japanese army at Unbong Peak of Hwangsan Mountain.
