The hike up to Donggosa Temple is a refreshing climb, and the temple provides a stunning panoramic view of downtown Jeonju. The temple buildings were constructed one after another along the mountain ridge, and stand in a row on either side of Daeungjeon Hall. The temple is modest and tastefully decorated with portraits of deceased great Buddhist monks and wooden Buddhist murals. The hiking trail to the right of Donggosa Temple leads to Chimyeongjasan Martyrs Ground, which is the graveyard of persecuted Catholics from the late Joseon dynasty.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-63-288-1626|\n|restdate:|N/A (open all year round)|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-04-1672821551267/1605496_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-04-1672821551267/1605496_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-04-1672821551267/1605497_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-04-1672821551267/1605497_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-04-1672821551267/1605499_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-04-1672821551267/1605499_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-04-1672821551267/1605500_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-04-1672821551267/1605500_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-04-1672821551267/1605501_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-04-1672821551267/1605501_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-04-1672821551267/1605502_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-04-1672821551267/1605502_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-63-288-1626](tel:+82632881626)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.8095957238\nlongitude: 127.1677212648\ntitle: 103-100, Naksujeong 2-gil, Wansan-gu, Jeonju-si, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-04-1672821551267","title":"Jeonju Donggosa Temple (동고사 (전주))","description":"Donggosa Temple, located on Seungamsan Mountain in Jeonju, is a Buddhist temple of the Taego Order.

The tunnel is approximately 3 meters in x_height and 10 meters in length, and divides the villages of Sindu Maeul into Dugil-ri, Seolcheon-myeon and Inam Maeul in Socheon-ri. During the Three Kingdoms Period, the rocky ridges of Seokgyeonsan Mountain drew the boundary of Sillas Mupung in the east with Baekjes Seolcheo to the west. <br>Tracing the history from the Three Kingdoms Period to the Goryeo dynasty, the cultures and traditions of the two regions were markedly different. If curious about the difference, one could simply stop by Seolcheon on market day, where the Muju and Mupung local dialects and customs can easily be distinguished. <br><br>People used to cross Seokgyeonsan Mountain by a footpath along the rocky ridge to travel between Seolcheon and Mupung. During the Japanese occupation, a new road was created by turning a cave into a tunnel through the mountain so cows and horse carts could freely pass from Muju to Gimcheon. <br><br>General Kim Yoo Shin from the Silla Kingdom, the hero of unification of the Three Kingdoms, often passed by the gate, later giving rise to the gates nickname, Tongilmun (literally Unification Gate). The gate is number one on the list of 33 scenic sites in Gucheon-dong.","regDate":"2023-01-08","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Nature","Natural Resources","Rocks"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-08-1673167020129/2366378_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-08-1673167020129"},{"id":"2023-01-08-1673163317005","title":"Omokdae and Imokdae Historic Sites (오목대와 이목대)","description":"Omokdae Historic Site is located on top of a steep hill and is one of the places where Yi Seong-gye, who later became King Taejo, the first king of the Joseon dynasty, stopped to celebrate his victory on his way home from a war against the Japanese army at Unbong Peak of Hwangsan Mountain.
