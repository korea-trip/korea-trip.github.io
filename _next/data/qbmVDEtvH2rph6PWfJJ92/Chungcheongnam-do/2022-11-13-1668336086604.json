The trails are as easy and suitable for all hikers including the elderly and young hikers. A distant view of the west sea is even visible from the top of the mountain. Gayasan Mountain offers amazing scenery all year round, most notably in spring when azaleas, royal azaleas, and an array of wildflowers are in full bloom.<br /><br />The mountain also contains the Seosan Rock-carved Buddha Triad (National Treasure), which is considered the best rock-carved Buddha from the Baekje period. The mountain is also home to Bowonsa Temple Site, Gaesimsa Temple, and Illaksa Temple.

Serving as a home to several relics and a nine-story stone pagoda, the temple site and buildings are well maintained and neatly cleaned on a daily basis.  <br><br>According to legends, Monk Euigak originally had planned on building a temple in Sinam-myeon in Yesan. He went to China and brought a Buddha statue, praying earnestly on his way back aboard a boat. Upon his arrival, he sighted a pair of golden crows flying above the boat and followed the birds before they disappeared. He found the birds at the temples current location, drinking from a puddle of water that had an aromatic smell. From then on the mountain was called Geumosan, meaning the mountain of golden crow, and the temple was named Hyangcheonsa, meaning the temple of fragrant water.","regDate":"2022-11-18","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-18-1668768128450/1962103_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Chungcheongnam-do/2022-11-18-1668768128450"},{"id":"2022-11-18-1668764409764","title":"Yeonpo Beach (연포해수욕장)","description":"Located on the Taean Coast, Yeonpo Beach has been a popular vacation spot since 1972.
