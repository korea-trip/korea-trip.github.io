The temple was reconstructed in the 26th year of King Sukjong‚Äôs reign (1700) after it was completely destroyed during the Imjin War (1592-1598). However, it was almost burnt down in the 19th year of King Gojong‚Äôs reign (1882).<br> <br>It is presently preserved just as it was during the Unified Silla Kingdom, with its three-story pagoda and its 11 treasures with a total of 17 cultural assets. The entrance of the temple lies in the middle of a rice field and the temple has a pastoral view, surrounded by trees. From the entrance, visitors can cross the half-moon shaped stone bridge to find a remarkable totem pole.","regDate":"2023-01-07","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-07-1673084146360/1604040_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-07-1673084146360"},{"id":"2023-01-07-1673080623612","title":"Namwon Recreational Forest (ÎÇ®ÏõêÏûêÏó∞Ìú¥ÏñëÎ¶º)","description":"Namwon Recreational Forest is located at the base of Cheonhwangsan Mountain.
