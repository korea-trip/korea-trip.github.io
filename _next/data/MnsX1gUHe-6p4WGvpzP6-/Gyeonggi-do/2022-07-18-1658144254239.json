On old maps, the mountain had been called Mayusan Mountain because of the horses raised in the area, but today it is more widely known as Yumyeongsan Mountain. The trail that starts from Yangpyeong leads to an expansive and open grassland. The hiking trails are also connected to those of Mount Daebusan and Mount Sogunisan.
