Yeongsil Trail is known as the best autumn foliage course on Hallasan Mountain. Yeongsil Course is 3.7 kilometers and takes approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes. It starts from Yeongsil Rest Area and follows a relatively gentle slope lined with beautiful trees and autumn foliage for about one kilometer.<br> After that, an uphill path emerges along steep mountain ridges. The deep Yeongsilgyegok Valley and vast rock walls could be the result of a large volcano entrance in the past. After passing Byeongpungbawi Rock, the path becomes relatively flat until Witsaeoruem Rest Area. The first attraction of Yeongsil is a group of volcanic rocks collectively called Yeongsilgiam. These oddly shaped rocks are situated to the right of a big valley at 1,400 meters to 1,600 meters above sea level, soaring upwards towards the sky. Pass by Sajebi Hill to get a glass of mineral spring water, and  reach Eorimok to take the path downwards.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-64-713-9950~1,<br>+82-64-747-9950|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|[Ascent]<br> November-February 06:00-12:00 <br>March-April & September-October 05:30-14:30 <br>May-August 05:00-15:00<br>[Descent]<br>Witsaeoreum Volcanic Cone: November-February 15:00 / March-April & September-October 16:00 / May-August 17:00<br>Dongneung Peak: November-February 13:30 / March-April & September-October 14:00 / May-August 14:30<br>Nambyeok divide: November-February 14:00 / Spring, Fall 14:30 / May-August 15:00<br>* Hiking strictly limited to designated trail|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Available Facilities:|Trail information center, mountain museum, convenience store, etc. |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-02-14-1676364076313/2617905_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-14-1676364076313/2617905_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-14-1676364076313/2617906_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-14-1676364076313/2617906_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-14-1676364076313/2617907_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-14-1676364076313/2617907_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-14-1676364076313/2617908_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-14-1676364076313/2617908_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-64-713-9950](tel:+82647139950)\n- [üè†www.jeju.go.kr/hallasan</a> <br><a href=\"https://visitjeju.net/kr/#\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"ÏÉàÏ∞Ω : ÎπÑÏßìÏ†úÏ£º ÌôàÌéòÏù¥ÏßÄÎ°ú Ïù¥Îèô\">visitjeju.net](https://www.jeju.go.kr/hallasan/index.htm)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.3402306397\nlongitude: 126.4803110551\ntitle: 246, Yeongsil-ro, Seogwipo-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2023-02-14-1676364076313","title":"Yeongsil Trail (Hallasan National Park) (ÌïúÎùºÏÇ∞ ÏòÅÏã§)","description":"Hallasan Mountain has five trails excluding Donnaeko Course that is closed for nature preservation.

The cave is approximately 200 meters in length, 10 meters in x_width and 5 meters in x_height. It is thought to have been created by the lava that erupted from Hallasan Mountain some 25 million years ago. This cave uniquely contains features of both lava and limestone caves. The entire area surrounding the cave is a huge stratum of seashells and sand, while the interior of the cave has a mystical ambience due to its various formations such as stalactites and stalagmites, hanging from the ceiling and sprouting up from the bottom of the cave. The cave also features pillars formed when stalactites and stalagmites join together. The cave walls are covered in lime, which at times looks like beautiful cave paintings. The temperature inside the cave stays at 17~18‚ÑÉ throughout the year, making the cave a welcome escape from the summer heat and a great place to keep warm during winter. <Br><Br>Hyeopjaegul Lava Tube has been designated Natural Monument No. 236 and ranks among the world‚Äôs major mysterious caves, such as the stone salt cave of Peru and the underwater limestone caves of Yugoslavia. As Hyeopjaegul Lava Tube is close to Ssangyonggul Lava Tube, the two can be visited on the same day.","regDate":"2023-02-16","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-16-1676532952288"},{"id":"2023-02-16-1676529633249","title":"Honinji Pond (ÌòºÏù∏ÏßÄ)","description":"Honinji Pond is connected to a myth of how agriculture and farming started on Jeju Island.
