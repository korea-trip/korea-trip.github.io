The reservoir was recreated and expanded into todays lotus habitat thanks to the effort of Jeong Su-dong, who planted twelve lotus roots along the shoreline and took care of them dearly after dreaming of twelve white cranes landing upon the reservoir. The white lotus flowers in this pond blossom and fall from July until September. A lotus festival is held in August, when the flowers are at their peak.","regDate":"2023-01-26","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollanam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Eco-Tourism Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-26-1674722336812/2399156_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollanam-do/2023-01-26-1674722336812"},{"id":"2023-01-26-1674718570005","title":"Muan Ecological Tidal Flat Land (무안황토갯벌랜드(구 무안생태갯벌센터))","description":"Muan Ecological Tidal Flat Land in Muan, Jeollanam-do was established in an effort to raise awareness of the ecology and importance of natural wetlands.
