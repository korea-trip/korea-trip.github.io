This pond was originally a reservoir made during the Japanese colonial period for irrigation, but was abandoned with the development of the Yeongsangang River system. The reservoir was recreated and expanded into todays lotus habitat thanks to the effort of Jeong Su-dong, who planted twelve lotus roots along the shoreline and took care of them dearly after dreaming of twelve white cranes landing upon the reservoir. The white lotus flowers in this pond blossom and fall from July until September. A lotus festival is held in August, when the flowers are at their peak.","regDate":"2023-01-26","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollanam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Eco-Tourism Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-26-1674722336812/2399156_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollanam-do/2023-01-26-1674722336812"},{"id":"2023-01-26-1674718570005","title":"Muan Ecological Tidal Flat Land (Î¨¥ÏïàÌô©ÌÜ†Í∞ØÎ≤åÎûúÎìú(Íµ¨ Î¨¥ÏïàÏÉùÌÉúÍ∞ØÎ≤åÏÑºÌÑ∞))","description":"Muan Ecological Tidal Flat Land in Muan, Jeollanam-do was established in an effort to raise awareness of the ecology and importance of natural wetlands.

The area is home to 27 historical and cultural sites and the beautiful Haebochoen Stream, which is shaded by over 40 different types of trees including zelkova trees, nettle trees, and willow trees. Some of the town‚Äôs traditional houses, which are about 80 years old, offer guesthouse accommodations to tourists. They include Mopyeongheon, Sopungga and Hisomun (a house made of yellow sod).<Br><Br>In addition to the beautiful country scenery, there is a great selection of available programs that highlight the area‚Äôs specialties, including  mulberry-picking, silkworm-feeding and Korean traditional sauce-making. You can also visit a traditional watermill, which has been restored, and swim and splash around in the forest stream. Visitors are encouraged to try their hand at making green tea cakes at the traditional teahouse nearby. <br><Br>The area of Mopyeong is full of things to entertain visitors, including a number of attractions and special events. Some of the area‚Äôs most praiseworthy attractions are the Hampyeong Butterfly Festival, the Cluster Amaryllis Festival in Yongcheonsa Temple, the Chrysanthemum Festival, and the Hampyeong Eco Park and Folk Museum. <br><Br>Other towns well worth a visit in the Mopyeong area are Hamo Maeul, Ungok Maeul and Wonsan Maeul.
