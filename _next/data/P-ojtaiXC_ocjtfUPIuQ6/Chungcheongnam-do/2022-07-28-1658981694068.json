The site is one of Korea's representative relic sites of the Old Stone Age, and is designated Historic Site No. 334. The site was excavated 10 times between 1964 and 1974 by teams from Yonsei University Museum. The excavation of 27 layers of stratum produced relics proving people lived in the area through 11 cultural eras. The area was excavated again in 1990 and 1993, producing even more cultural artifacts and helping to create a clearer image of the people living in that time.","regDate":"2022-07-28","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-28-1658984540847/531206_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Chungcheongnam-do/2022-07-28-1658984540847"},{"id":"2022-07-28-1658975944792","title":"Anmyeondo Island (ÏïàÎ©¥ÎèÑ)","description":"Located 30 km away from Taean, Anmyeondo Island is the sixth largest island in Korea, where a 200-meter bridge constructed in 1970 connects the island with Taean-gun. The peninsula connected to Nammyeon was isolated during the Joseon Dynasty by cutting off access between Changgi-ri in Anmyeon-eup and Shinon-ri in Nammyeon for the convenience of tax transportation. The island's coast is lined with some 14 beaches as well as abundant pine trees, which are symbols of Anmyeon-eup. The island also owns Anmyeondo Natural Forest, along with the Mogamju Forest (Natural Monument No. 138).","regDate":"2022-07-28","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongnam-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-28-1658975944792/2426575_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Chungcheongnam-do/2022-07-28-1658975944792","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Chungcheongnam-do/2022-07-28-1658975944792"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
