The street became connected samchi, or grilled seerfish, over 40 years ago with the opening House of Inha, a home-style restaurant. Originally, the street was not known for samchi, but it became one of the most popular menus at the restuarant, with many other shops in the area following in this trend. In 2002, it was designated as the grilled seerfish street and a signboard was put up at the street entrance. Currently, there are about a dozen grilled seerfish restaurants lining the street, and each restaurant has a unique signboard of its own. The fish are imported from New Zealand, and each restaurant offers a distinct taste resulting from different grilling methods and sauces. The restaurants also sell a variety of appetizers and side dishes at affordable prices.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|expagerange:|Open to visitors of all ages|\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-32-832-3031|\n|restdate:|Varies by shop|\n|usetime:|Varies by shop|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-12-1657605089652/728363_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-12-1657605089652/728363_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-12-1657605089652/728365_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-12-1657605089652/728365_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-12-1657605089652/728366_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-12-1657605089652/728366_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-32-832-3031](tel:+82328323031)\n- [üè†itour.incheon.go.kr</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.icjg.go.kr/tour/cttu0207a01\" target=\"_blank\">www.icjg.go.kr](http://itour.incheon.go.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.4757224674\nlongitude: 126.6286721359\ntitle: 57, Uhyeon-ro 67beon-gil, Jung-gu, Incheon\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway]<br>\nDongincheon Station (Seoul \nSubway Line 1), Exit 2. <br>\nTurn right, then immediately  turn left, and then go straight for about 150 m. <br>\nTurn right at the corner onto Uhyeonno 67beon-gil. <br>\n<br>\n[Bus] <br>\nDongincheon Station Bus Stop<Br>\n- Local Bus: 2, 3, 4, 6, 6-1, 10, 11, 15, 16, 17-1, 21, 21-1, 22, 23, 24, 27, 28, 41, 42, 45, 46, or 62 <br>  \n- Express bus: 105, 112, or 306\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-12-1657605089652","title":"Dongincheon Samchi Street (ÎèôÏù∏Ï≤ú ÏÇºÏπòÍ±∞Î¶¨)","description":"Dongincheon Samchi Street is located in front of Dongincheon Station in an alley to the side of Incheon Educational and Cultural Center for Students.

Despite the tragic incident of November 2010 shelling from North Korea, this bucolic island offers many natural and cultural attractions.<br><br><b>Island History<br></b>The earliest known history of Socheongdo Island comes from Chungmin-sa Temple, which was built to commemorate the island's once abundant but now extinct fish species called Yellow corbina (Sciaenidae). This fish was related to the family of fish commonly called drums, croakers, or hardheads for the repetitive throbbing or drumming sounds they make. When the economy flourished thanks to profitable fishing, the Socheongdo port was congested with fishing boats, so much that it was said that one could cross from one island to the next by walking over boats. The species of fish is depleted, and the island remains as quiet with views of North Korea.<br><br>In November 2010, Socheongdo Island was hit by the fatal shelling from North Korea that killed two civilians and two soldiers. In recent months, the island has made an attempt to recover its tourism industry and to develop security tourism by blending its newer military presence at tourist attractions.","regDate":"2022-08-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-12-1660340265213/1385383_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-08-12-1660340265213"},{"id":"2022-08-12-1660336750306","title":"Yeonan Pier (Ïó∞ÏïàÎ∂ÄÎëê)","description":"Yeonan Pier is the starting point for all coastal passenger ships bound for the numerous islands in the western sea.
