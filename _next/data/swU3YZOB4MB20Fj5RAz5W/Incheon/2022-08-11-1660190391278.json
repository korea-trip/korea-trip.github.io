Legend has it that in the year 416 (during the reign of King Jangsu of Goguryeo), a Buddhist monk named Cheonchukguk climbed Goryeosan Mountain and found Oryeonji Pond where the five-colored lotus flowers bloomed. The monk picked the lotus flower petals and blew them into the air. He then built a temple where each of the petals had landed, naming the temples according to their corresponding color: Jeokseoksa Temple, formerly Jeokryeonsa Temple (red lotus), Baengnyeonsa Temple (white lotus), Cheongryeonsa Temple (blue lotus), Hwangryeonsa Temple (yellow lotus), and Heungnyeonsa Temple (black lotus). \n<br><br>\nAround 130 dolmens are distributed along the foot of Goryeosan Mountain. Sirumisan Mountain, on the northern side of Goryeosan Mountain is said to have been the birthplace of General Yeongaesomun of the Goguryeo Kingdom.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-32-930-3515|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Hiking Course:|[Course 1] Baengnyeonsa Temple - Azalea field (3.7 km / Approx. 1 hr 20 min) <br /><br />[Course 2] Cheongnyeonsa Temple- Azalea field (2.9 km / Approx. 1 hr) <br /><br />[Course 3] Gobigogae Pass - Azalea field (2.4 km / Approx. 1 hr) <br /><br />[Course 4] Jeokseoksa Temple - Azalea field (5.2 km / Approx. 1 hr 50 min)<br /><br />[Course 5] Mikkujigogae Pass - Azalea field (5.8 km / Approx. 2 hr)|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2376706_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2376706_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2376708_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2376708_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2648946_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2648946_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2648947_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2648947_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2648948_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2648948_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2648949_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2648949_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2648950_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2648950_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2648951_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2648951_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2648952_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2648952_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2376705_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2376705_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-32-930-3515](tel:+82329303515)\n- [üè†www.ganghwa.go.kr](http://www.ganghwa.go.kr/open_content/tour)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.7407298666\nlongitude: 126.4352713405\ntitle: Gocheon-ri, Ganghwa-gun, Incheon\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus + Subway]<BR>\nSinchon Station (Seoul Subway Line 2), Exit 4.<br>Go straight 260m to arrive at the bus stop in front of Artreon.<br>From the bus stop, take Bus 3000 to Ganghwa Bus Terminal. <BR>From Ganghwa Bus Terminal, take Bus No. 1, 23, 25, 27, 30, 32 or 35 and get off at Dolmen Square Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-11-1660190391278","title":"Goryeosan Mountain (Í≥†Î†§ÏÇ∞)","description":"Goryeosan Mountain, once referred to as Oryeonsan, is a mountain rich in folklore.

Despite the tragic incident of November 2010 shelling from North Korea, this bucolic island offers many natural and cultural attractions.<br><br><b>Island History<br></b>The earliest known history of Socheongdo Island comes from Chungmin-sa Temple, which was built to commemorate the island's once abundant but now extinct fish species called Yellow corbina (Sciaenidae). This fish was related to the family of fish commonly called drums, croakers, or hardheads for the repetitive throbbing or drumming sounds they make. When the economy flourished thanks to profitable fishing, the Socheongdo port was congested with fishing boats, so much that it was said that one could cross from one island to the next by walking over boats. The species of fish is depleted, and the island remains as quiet with views of North Korea.<br><br>In November 2010, Socheongdo Island was hit by the fatal shelling from North Korea that killed two civilians and two soldiers. In recent months, the island has made an attempt to recover its tourism industry and to develop security tourism by blending its newer military presence at tourist attractions.","regDate":"2022-08-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-12-1660340265213/1385383_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-08-12-1660340265213"},{"id":"2022-08-12-1660336750306","title":"Yeonan Pier (Ïó∞ÏïàÎ∂ÄÎëê)","description":"Yeonan Pier is the starting point for all coastal passenger ships bound for the numerous islands in the western sea.
