The temple was built during the 15th year of King Beopheungs reign (514-540) to wish for peace and prosperity for all. It was later rebuilt in 751 by Kim Dae-seong. Unfortunately, the temple caught fire during the Imjin War (1592-1598).

The temple now holds seven national treasures, a number of additional important heritages, and was designated a World Cultural Heritage Site along with the nearby Seokguram Grotto by UNESCO in December 1995.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-54-746-9913|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Weekdays 09:00-17:00<br>Weekends and public holidays 08:00-17:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Cars: 1,000 won / Buses: 2,000 won|\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals: Adults 6,000 won / Teenagers 4,000 won / Children 3,000 won / Preschoolers 2,000 won <br>Groups: Teenagers 3,500 won / Children 2,500 won <br><br>* Adults (ages 19 & over) / Teenagers (ages 13-18) / Children (ages 7-12) / Preschoolers (ages under 7)* Groups: 20 or more|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Available (Inquire in advance)|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-27-1669531284691/1954568_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-27-1669531284691/1954568_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-27-1669531284691/2367738_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-27-1669531284691/2367738_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-27-1669531284691/2367741_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-27-1669531284691/2367741_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-27-1669531284691/2640463_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-27-1669531284691/2640463_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-27-1669531284691/2640464_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-27-1669531284691/2640464_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-27-1669531284691/2678602_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-27-1669531284691/2678602_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-27-1669531284691/2678603_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-27-1669531284691/2678603_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-27-1669531284691/2678606_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-27-1669531284691/2678606_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-27-1669531284691/2367739_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-27-1669531284691/2367739_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-27-1669531284691/2367740_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-27-1669531284691/2367740_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-54-746-9913](tel:+82547469913)\n- [üè†www.bulguksa.or.kr</a><br><a href=\" https://www.templestay.com/temple_info.asp?t_id=bgs9913 \" target=\"_blank\">www.templestay.com](http://www.bulguksa.or.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.7892734269\nlongitude: 129.3318475148\ntitle: 385, Bulguk-ro, Gyeongju-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-27-1669531284691","title":"Gyeongju Bulguksa Temple [UNESCO World Heritage] (Í≤ΩÏ£º Î∂àÍµ≠ÏÇ¨ [Ïú†ÎÑ§Ïä§ÏΩî ÏÑ∏Í≥ÑÎ¨∏ÌôîÏú†ÏÇ∞])","description":"Bulguksa Temple is a representative relic of Buddhist culture from the Silla kingdom.

The first section is the Namsan Area, a treasure trove of Buddhist art masterpieces dating back to the Silla Kingdom. Gyeongju Namsan Mountain (often referred to as an ‚Äòoutdoor museum‚Äô) is home to many historical heritage sites from the Silla Kingdom. Major attractions include  Poseokjeong (Historic Site No.1), Tapgok Maaejosanggun (Treasure No. 201), Cheollyongsaji Three-story Stone Pagoda (Treasure No. 1188), Chilbulam Maae Stone Buddha (Treasure No. 200), Bulgok Seated Stone Buddha (Treasure No. 198), and 37 other Buddhist relics<br><br>The second section is the Wolseong Area, one of the former palace sites of the Silla Kingdom.

Lastly, is the Sanseong Area, housing remnants of the major defense system for the capital city.

The forest is thickly populated by ancient zelkova and willow trees rooted on gently sloping hills and along the small stream in the northwest part of the woods. According to legend, the forest is closely associated with myths surrounding the birth of Alji, the founder of the Gyeongju Kim clan. As such, it is designated national Historic Site No. 19. <br>Legend has it that King Talhae heard a rooster crying from deep inside the Sirim Woods. Chancellor Hogong was sent to investigate. Upon arriving, he found a rooster crying underneath a tree on which hung a golden box. Hogong immediately reported his find to the king, who instructed him to bring the golden box into the palace. The king opened the box and found a small child inside, Kim Alji. The forest, which had previously been called ‚ÄòSirim‚Äô or ‚ÄòGurim‚Äô, became known as ‚ÄòGyerim‚Äô, (gye‚Äô meaning rooster). The name Gyerim was also used to refer to the Silla kingdom. <br>Alji was adopted as the king‚Äôs son, but because the crown was passed on to King Pasa of the Park family, he never ascended the throne. The Kim clan later became the royal bloodline with the coronation of King Naemul some years later. <br> The memorial stone recording the birth of Kim Alji was erected in the third year of King Sunjos rule in the Joseon dynasty. Located close to the royal fortress of Silla, the forest is still deeply revered as the mystical birthplace of the first ancestor of the royal Kim clan of Silla. Yellow canola blossoms along the path connecting Daereungwon with Gyerim and Banwolseong only add to the magical ambiance of the forest.","regDate":"2022-11-28","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-28-1669613785218/2493186_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-11-28-1669613785218"},{"id":"2022-11-28-1669610583651","title":"Gyeongju Golgulsa Temple (Í≥®Íµ¥ÏÇ¨ (Í≤ΩÏ£º))","description":"Located at the foot of Hamwolsan Mountain, Golgulsa Temple houses twelve caves in a tall cliff, with a rock-carved statue of Buddha sitting at the highest point. Although the main temple hall may seem like an ordinary building with its tile roof and walls, the ceiling and the walls are all part of a cave. Some caves are very small, large enough to allow only one person to sit in, while some are spacious enough to provide room for three to four people. From statues of young monks to old and wise monks, a variety of rock-carved sculptures can be seen placed throughout the caves. The caves are connected by steep stairs carved into the cliff, leading all the way to the top. The Buddha statue situated at the top of the cliff is designated as Treasure No. 581 and is 4 meters in x_height and 2.2 meters in x_width. Unfortunately, this granite statue has gone through deterioration over time and a glass roof is built over the statue to prevent further damage.
