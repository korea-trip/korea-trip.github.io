Jarasum consists of four islands called Dongdo, Seodo, Jungdo, and Namdo, and has various leisure and park facilities. Visitors can find a car camping site and the filming location of the popular TV drama series 'Iris' on Seodo (west island), and an eco-cultural park with a grass plaza of over 100 meters in diameter on Jungdo (central island).
