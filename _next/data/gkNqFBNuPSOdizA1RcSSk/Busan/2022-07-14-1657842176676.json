Those who were displaced by the war gathered around the area and made makeshift housing out of sticks and tarps. The place also functioned as a marketplace where residents traded aid goods that were delivered at the nearby port. It was a place to meet family members separated during the war and a place that has since then come to symbolize the sorrow and grief of those living during the Korean War. The place has the deepest significance for the over 100,000 people that were displaced during the war and were subsequently scattered throughout Yeongju-dong Hill, Donggwang-dong and Bosu-dong.<br> <br><b>* Railway </b><br>In memory of the Busan Train Station (now the location of the Jungang-dong Trade Center), a 140m-street was created in front of the 40-step Stairway, together with the 40-step Square and Railroad Crossing Plaza.<br><br><b>* Seaway</b> <br>In commemoration of the Busan Port, under the theme of a 'seaway,' a 120m-street has been created in front of Sora Stairway, together with the Sora Stair Square and Pier Plaza. <br><br><b>* Others (The Gate of Peace)<br></b>The Gate of Peace is located near the entrance of Railway.

Originally a protected area, entrance was not permitted until its opening to the public in 1996, when visitors could first experience the untouched landscape. Now, visitors can fish, explore the observatory, and enjoy the walking path and the elevated bridge. The abundunt pine trees along the walking path make for a pleasant stroll while the path up to the observatory offers great views. If it is fishing that you want, here you can fish on the ocean as well as off the fantastically shaped rocks.  There is also a famous road to go for a drive, leading from Songdo Beach to Amnam Park. This drive takes approximately 5 minutes, but it takes about 20 minutes on foot.","regDate":"2022-07-15","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Busan","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-15-1657860472029/1919826_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Busan/2022-07-15-1657860472029"},{"id":"2022-07-15-1657854261522","title":"75 Square (75Í¥ëÏû•)","description":"A small plaza projecting toward the southern coast of Jeoryeongdo Island, 75 Square is one of the eight scenic sites of Yeongdo-gu in Busan.
