Originally a protected area, entrance was not permitted until its opening to the public in 1996, when visitors could first experience the untouched landscape. Now, visitors can fish, explore the observatory, and enjoy the walking path and the elevated bridge. The abundunt pine trees along the walking path make for a pleasant stroll while the path up to the observatory offers great views. If it is fishing that you want, here you can fish on the ocean as well as off the fantastically shaped rocks.  There is also a famous road to go for a drive, leading from Songdo Beach to Amnam Park. This drive takes approximately 5 minutes, but it takes about 20 minutes on foot.","regDate":"2022-07-15","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Busan","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-15-1657860472029/1919826_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Busan/2022-07-15-1657860472029"},{"id":"2022-07-15-1657854261522","title":"75 Square (75Í¥ëÏû•)","description":"A small plaza projecting toward the southern coast of Jeoryeongdo Island, 75 Square is one of the eight scenic sites of Yeongdo-gu in Busan.
