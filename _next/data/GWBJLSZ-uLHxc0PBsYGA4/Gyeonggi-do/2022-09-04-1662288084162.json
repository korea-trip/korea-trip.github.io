A monument rests within the park that pays tribute to the 18 Korean and foreign war correspondents who died trying to share their, often tragic, stories of the war. They include Han Gyu-ho of the Seoul Shinmun as well as journalists from the U.S. (10 people), Britain (4 people), France (2 people) and the Philippines (1 person). There is also a tower built to commemorate the loyalty and courage of 10 brave soldiers who sacrificed themselves in a bomb attack, a memorial tower dedicated to anticommunist guerilla units from the Gaema Plateau, and a statue of Colonel Lee Yu-jung and Second Lieutenant Kim Man-sul.","regDate":"2022-09-16","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Parks"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-09-16-1663309753166"},{"id":"2022-09-16-1663304803597","title":"Paju Jangneung Royal Tomb [UNESCO World Heritage] (파주 장릉(인조, 인열왕후) [유네스코 세계문화유산])","description":"Located in Paju, Jangneung is the tomb of King Injo (1595-1649, reign 1623-1649), the 16th ruler of the Joseon dynasty, and Queen Inyeol. <br><br>King Injo took the throne in 1623 after having overthrown the previous king, Gwanghaegun, in a military revolt.
