Approximately 150 thousand tiles compose the roof of the Main Office. Each tile was baked individually to make them strong enough to last for hundreds of years. The blue tiles and the smoothly curving roofline blend beautifully with Bugaksan Mountain in the backdrop. <br /><br />Cheong Wa Dae is comprised of the Main Office, Yeongbingwan (State Guest House), Chunchugwan (Spring and Autumn) Hall, Nokjiwon Garden, Mugunghwa (Rose of Sharon) Hill, and Chilgung Palace. It is interesting to see that all the buildings are unique and beautifully designed, built in the traditional Korean style. Just outside the premises is Cheongwadae Sarangchae, an exhibition hall showing the history of Cheong Wa Dae and the Korean presidency, as well as gifts received by heads of State over the years. The hall is open free to all visitors.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)|\n|parking:|Available (Gyeongbokgung Palace paid parking lot)<br>* Inquiries: +82-2-720-7595|\n|restdate:|Tuesdays|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Parking Fees:|[Gyeongbokgung Palace Parking Lot (2 hours)]<br>Small vehicles: 2,000 won / 4,000 won for open space parking lot<br>Mid- & large-sized vehicles: 4,000 won<br><br>* 500 won every 15 min after first two hours|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Reservation Info. for Foreigners:|Online reservation required|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-21-1658403194324/774319_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658403194324/774319_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658403194324/938743_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658403194324/938743_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658403194324/938745_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658403194324/938745_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658403194324/938746_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658403194324/938746_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658403194324/938761_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658403194324/938761_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658403194324/938771_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658403194324/938771_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658403194324/938773_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658403194324/938773_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658403194324/938776_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658403194324/938776_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658403194324/938783_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658403194324/938783_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658403194324/938790_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658403194324/938790_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-2-1330](tel:+8221330)\n- [üè†www.opencheongwadae.kr](https://www.opencheongwadae.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5825467279\nlongitude: 126.9728266401\ntitle: 45, Hyoja-ro 13-gil, Jongno-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-21-1658403194324","title":"Cheong Wa Dae (Blue House) (Ï≤≠ÏôÄÎåÄ)","description":"The signature markings of the Presidential Residence of Cheong Wa Dae are its blue tiles on the Main Office; it is the first thing to catch one's attention upon viewing the premises.

As the number of followers increased, the building underwent construction and officially became a church in 1895. Chungdong Church is the only remaining church building from the 19th century. The church was expanded once more in 1926, changing its from a cross-shaped building to a square one. The expansion was made by adding walls using bricks as not to damage the original building structure.
