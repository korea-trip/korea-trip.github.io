As the number of followers increased, the building underwent construction and officially became a church in 1895. Chungdong Church is the only remaining church building from the 19th century. The church was expanded once more in 1926, changing its from a cross-shaped building to a square one. The expansion was made by adding walls using bricks as not to damage the original building structure. The architecture was built in a simplified version of an American gothic house with arched window frames.","regDate":"2022-07-21","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Holy Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-21-1658439460553/1955149_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-07-21-1658439460553"},{"id":"2022-07-21-1658435921977","title":"Choong Ang High School (Ï§ëÏïôÍ≥†Îì±ÌïôÍµê)","description":"Choong Ang High School is located in Jong-ro near Samcheongdong-gil.
