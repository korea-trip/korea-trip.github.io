It is said that the dish was first offered as an affordable dish to accompany drinks, favored by blue-collar laborers who gathered at the early labor market in front of Pyeonghwa Market in the 1970s. Rather than being pan-fried, chicken gizzard is deep-fried like chicken meat. Inexpensive and delicious, the dish has remained popular. Dakddongjip Town was designated the third \"Good Street” by the Community Chest of Korea, a network of governing bodies that run a philanthropic organization. The Good Street designation is given to the streets where storekeepers subscribe to the Community Chest of Korea’s Good Street campaign to share good deeds.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)|\n|parking:|Paid parking lot inside of Pyeonghwa Market|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-14-1660498707189/1835958_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-14-1660498707189/1835958_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-14-1660498707189/1929303_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-14-1660498707189/1929303_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-14-1660498707189/1929304_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-14-1660498707189/1929304_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-14-1660498707189/1929306_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-14-1660498707189/1929306_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-14-1660498707189/1929307_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-14-1660498707189/1929307_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-14-1660498707189/1929308_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-14-1660498707189/1929308_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-14-1660498707189/1929314_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-14-1660498707189/1929314_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-14-1660498707189/2020462_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-14-1660498707189/2020462_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-14-1660498707189/2020464_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-14-1660498707189/2020464_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-14-1660498707189/1835950_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-14-1660498707189/1835950_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-2-1330](tel:+8221330)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.8833661337\nlongitude: 128.6192824239\ntitle: 10, Ayang-ro 9-gil, Dong-gu, Daegu\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Train]<br>\nTake a train from Seoul Station to Dongdaegu Station.<br><br>\n\n[Express/Intercity Bus]<br>\nFrom Seoul Express Bus Terminal, take an express bus bound for Dong Daegu Express Bus Terminal.<br><br>\n\n[Local Bus]<br>\nGet on Express 1, Circular Line 2-1, 156, 401, 414-1, 521, 618, 708, 808, 980, Dong-gu 3 or Palgong 1. <br>\nGet off in front of Pyeonghwa Market.\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-14-1660498707189","title":"Dakddongjip Town in Pyeonghwa Market (대구 평화시장 닭똥집 골목)","description":"Dakddongjip Town in Pyeonghwa Market was established in 1972, and is a street specializing in chicken gizzard dishes.

It was during the time of Mun Gyeong-ho (1812-1874), the 18th descendant of Mun Ik-jeom, that the clan became established in Inheung. Mun executed his plan to create a village for the clan by putting down roots in the old site of Inheungsa Temple, a large-scale temple in the Goryeo era. <br><br>Yonghojae, which is a place for offering ancestral memorial services, is the first building established at the village constructed before or after 1920. The first residential building was built around the late 1800s in the form of thatched cottage. During the course of a hundred years, the village developed into what it is today. Featuring about 70 or so tile-roofed homes, Inheung Village is only about 200 years old but it is a great example of traditional residential homes of the em>yangban</em> upper class in the Yeongnam region. The harmony between the way the village is organized and the surrounding landscape is unique and rare.","regDate":"2022-08-15","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Daegu","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Folk Villages"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-15-1660549026542/1574148_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Daegu/2022-08-15-1660549026542"},{"id":"2022-08-15-1660546126115","title":"House of Yi Sang-hwa (이상화 고택)","description":"Yi Sang-hwa was a nationalist poet, who resisted the Japanese colonialism.
