The third peak is the highest, standing at 362 meters with a beautiful view and crisp air, making it ideal for hiking (3-hour course) and resting at the top. There is another mountain of the same name in Hongcheon, so this mountain is usually referred to as “Seosan Palbongsan.”","regDate":"2022-11-14","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongnam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-14-1668404666423/1919432_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Chungcheongnam-do/2022-11-14-1668404666423"},{"id":"2022-11-14-1668401983817","title":"Seosan Munsusa Temple (문수사(서산))","description":"The exact founding date of Munsusa Temple is unknown because there are no official records that have been discovered.

Around 600 items were discovered along with the prayer, including unbleached ramie cloth, a short-sleeved gown, rice, and barley. Munsunsa has the tranquil atmosphere of a mountain temple. When spring arrives, cherry blossom flowers and wild flowers bloom across the mountain and the nearby cattle farm call to mind a traditional Korean painting.<br><br>Munsusa Temples Geungnaksiljeon Hall is a beautiful building constructed in the Jusimpo style (the column brackets placed only on top of the columns) combined with Dapo style (the column brackets placed between columns as well as on top of the columns).

Inside the gorgeously and majestically carved hall are many relics including Gilt-bronze Seated Buddha, Samsebulsang statues (statues of Buddhas of Three Times (past, present and future)), Nahansang statues (statues of disciples of Buddha), and various portraits of Buddha.<br><br> The Gilt-bronze Seated Buddha (x_height  70cm, length between knees  50cm) was created in 1346.
