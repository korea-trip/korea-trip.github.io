Later, various vegetables, such as cabbage and onion, were added to the dish and stir-fried together on an iron plate. As people can eat it plenty at a reasonable price, dakgalbi has been popular among college students and soldiers, and at this time, dakgalbi earned its nicknames such as “People’s galbi (ribs)”, and “College students’ galbi.” The Dakgalbi Alley was established as dakgalbi restaurants were opened one by one on the backstreet of Myeongdong in Chuncheon, in the 1970s to 1980s. Currently, this 150 m-long alley is packed with dakgalbi restaurants on both sides.
