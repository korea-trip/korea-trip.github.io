It sits atop a hill east of Hwahongmun Gate and offers beautiful views of the surrounding scenery.

In 2011, the pavilion was designated as Treasure No. 1709. Banghwasuryujeong Pavilion is evaluated as one of the most original architectures in Hwaseong for its unique composition and roof design that offer a different look depending on the viewer's angle. Known to be the spot where King Jeongjo would stop by to rest on his way to Hwaseong Fortress, the pavilion offers a bird's-eye-view of Yeonmudae Post to the east and Janganmun Gate to the west with Paldalsan Mountain in the background.","regDate":"2022-07-18","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-18-1658123163334/2514373_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-07-18-1658123163334"},{"id":"2022-07-18-1658120855375","title":"Baegunbong Peak (백운봉)","description":"Baegunbong (alt. 940m) is a sharp pointed peak that sits on the border between Yangpyeong-eup and Okcheon-myeon in Yangpyeong-gun, Gyeonggi-do Province.
