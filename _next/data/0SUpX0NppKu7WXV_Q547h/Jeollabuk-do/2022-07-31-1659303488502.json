According to the Korean Language Society, the temple began to be called Eunsusa (meaning ‘Silver Water Temple’) after King Taejo (the founder of the Joseon dynasty) visited the temple and remarked that the water flowing nearby was as clean and smooth as pure silver. <br><br>\n\nThe temple is home to the largest known Beopgo (Buddhist drum used for rituals), which was produced in 1982. A stone sculpture and a statue of Granny Samsin (a goddess that looks after babies’ births and keeps them healthy) also stand at the temple. However, the temple’s most treasured assets are its two Natural Monuments: Emerald Gaiety (a climbing vine, Natural Monument No. 380) and the Cheongsil Pear Tree (Natural Monument No. 386). Reverse icicles, though found all over the mountainsides, are most readily and abundantly found in the Eunsusa Temple area.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-63-433-2502|\n|parking:|Maisan Provincial Park Parking Lot|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|[Cultural Assets (Maisan Tapgun & Geumdangsa)]<br>Individuals - Adults 3,000 won / Teenagers 2,000 won / Children 1,000 won<br />Groups - Adults 2,800 won / Teenagers 1,600 won / Children 800 won<br /<br><br>* Group: 30 or more people|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Not available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-31-1659303488502/1605747_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659303488502/1605747_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659303488502/1605748_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659303488502/1605748_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659303488502/1605749_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659303488502/1605749_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659303488502/1605750_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659303488502/1605750_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659303488502/1605751_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659303488502/1605751_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659303488502/1605753_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659303488502/1605753_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-63-433-2502](tel:+82634332502)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.7594668368\nlongitude: 127.4144950983\ntitle: 406, Maisannam-ro, Jinan-gun, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Jeonju Intercity Bus Terminal, take an intercity bus to Jinan Bus Terminal. <br>\nFrom Jinan Bus Terminal, take a bus bound for Maisan.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-31-1659303488502","title":"Eunsusa Temple (은수사)","description":"The temple located upon Maisan Mountain was called Sangwonsa Temple during the early Joseon dynasty and was later known as Jeongmyeongam Hermitage.

Next to the grassy playground you’ll find a therapeutic pebble path made for walking on bare foot, towering trees scattered around the playground offering some cool shade and a few swing chairs attached to the tall trees. There are three wooden look-out stations also shaded by the platanus trees. And in a corner of the playground is a campground capable of accommodating up to ten tents. The pond is home to more than ten varieties of water plants, including the lotus and water hyacinth. There are also some colourful native water life, such as the Crucian carp, daces, dark chubs, Chinese minnows, loaches, freshwater snails and marsh snails.  <br><br>The cafeteria is all made of pine.
