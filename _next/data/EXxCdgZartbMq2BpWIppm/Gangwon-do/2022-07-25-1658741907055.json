Along Gangneung's most famous food street the beans are ground for Chodang dubu, then through several steps, salt water from the East Sea is used in the congealing process resulting in a soft and light tofu.  The name of this village, Chodang, originates from the name of a famous family that once lived here known as Chodang-Heoyeop.  Heoyeop was the father of son, writer/poet Heo-gyun [1569~1618] and daughter, poet Heonan-seolheon [1563~1589].  A traditional-style Korean house has been reconstructed on the site where the original house of Heo-gyun and Heonan-seolheon once stood.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(English, Korean, Japanese, Chinese)<br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-33-640-4414|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-25-1658741907055/1022426_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658741907055/1022426_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658741907055/203503_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658741907055/203503_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658741907055/2365224_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658741907055/2365224_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658741907055/2365225_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658741907055/2365225_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658741907055/2365226_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658741907055/2365226_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658741907055/2365227_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658741907055/2365227_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658741907055/2365228_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658741907055/2365228_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658741907055/551894_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658741907055/551894_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-33-640-4414](tel:+82336404414)\n- [üè†gnchodangdubu.modoo.at](http://gnchodangdubu.modoo.at)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.7931115115\nlongitude: 128.9170802756\ntitle: 99, Chodangsundubu-gil, Gangneung-si, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n<b>Bus<br></b> From Gangneung Intercity Bus Terminal, take bus  206,  207 or 230.

The crystal clear waters of the Hantangang River wind around Goseokbawi Rock, a peculiarly shaped rock of about 10 meters tall that stands dominantly in the middle of the river. Goseokjeong Pavilion is a two-story tower-style pavilion that has an area of about 33 square meters, built halfway up the Hantangang River during the reign of King Jinpyeong (r. AD 579-632) of the Silla Kingdom. Today, Goseokjeong refers to the entire area around Goseokjeong Pavilion and the valley surrounding Goseok Rock. Designated as a Monument of Gangwon-do, the pavilion is known to have been one of the most favored places by King Jinpyeong of Silla Kingdom, and King Chungsuk of Goryeo dynasty. The area became all the more famous as the arena of Im Kkeok-jeong (?-1562), who was a legendary leader of a peasant rebellion in the early Joseon dynasty. <br><br>The pavilion was destroyed during the Korean War and restored in 1971 by community leaders in Cheorwon. Unfortunately, it was damaged once again by flood in 1996 and reconstructed the year after. There is a natural stone chamber inside Goseokbawi Rock that Im Kkeok-jeong used as a hiding place. On the opposite side, there are remains of a stone castle. Jiktang Waterfall is located about 2 kilometers up from this site, while Sundam Valley is situated about 2 kilometers in the downstream. Goseokjeong is a year-round tourist attraction with an extensive grass square and recreational facilities. It is also the starting point for DMZ tours as the Iron Triangle Battlefield Conservation Office is located here and in winter, visitors can enjoy migratory bird tour.","regDate":"2022-09-24","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Tourist Complexes"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-24-1664012586092/2567099_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-09-24-1664012586092"},{"id":"2022-09-24-1664009366328","title":"Gongjicheon Stream (Gold Scales Theme Street) (Í≥µÏßÄÏ≤ú(Ìô©Í∏àÎπÑÎäòÌÖåÎßàÍ±∞Î¶¨))","description":"The city of Chuncheon is surrounded by Uiamho, Chuncheonho, and Soyangho Lakes and is widely known as Lake City.
