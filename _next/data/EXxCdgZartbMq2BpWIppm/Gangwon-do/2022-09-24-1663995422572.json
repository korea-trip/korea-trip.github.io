Geumdanggyegok Valley is an impressive site with sections of both gentle and fast flowing valley waters. From late March through April full-blown azalea covers the mountainsides and valleys providing visitors with a refreshing spring scent.  <br><br>To reach Geumdanggyegok Valley, travel down along the Pyeongchanggang River from Jangpyeong or trek up the valley from Anmi Elementary School. Coming down to Pyeongchang-eup from Daehwa-myeon area, visitors will encounter an intersection called, ‚ÄúSaechugeori‚Äù. The intersection has two parts  Sanganmi and Haanmiri and a sign indicating the Geumdanggyegok Valley entrance. Across the valley, odd-shaped rock formations and cliffs appear one after another along the river. The area is a native habitat for a species of otter (Natural Treasure No. 330) and a favorite spot for catching catfish.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-33-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-33-330-2771|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Hiking Course:|Geumdanggyegok Valley - Geumdangsan Mountain (1,173 m) (Approx. 1 hr 30 min)|\n|Tour Course Information:|* Geumdanggyegok Valley - Lee Hyo-seok Culture Village - Heungjeonggyegok Valley - Lee Seungbok Memorial Hall <br>* Geumdanggyegok Valley - Neounngyegok Valley - Noseongsan Mountain - Gihwagyegok Valley|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-09-24-1663995422572/1177173_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-24-1663995422572/1177173_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-24-1663995422572/1177178_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-24-1663995422572/1177178_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-24-1663995422572/1177190_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-24-1663995422572/1177190_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-24-1663995422572/1177193_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-24-1663995422572/1177193_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-24-1663995422572/1177200_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-24-1663995422572/1177200_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-24-1663995422572/1177241_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-24-1663995422572/1177241_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-24-1663995422572/1177244_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-24-1663995422572/1177244_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-24-1663995422572/1177247_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-24-1663995422572/1177247_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-24-1663995422572/1177255_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-24-1663995422572/1177255_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-24-1663995422572/1177238_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-24-1663995422572/1177238_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-33-330-2771](tel:+82333302771)\n- [üè†tour.pc.go.kr](http://tour.pc.go.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.4824623569\nlongitude: 128.3942007364\ntitle: 766-2, Geumdanggyegok-ro, Pyeongchang-gun, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \nFrom Dong \nSeoul Bus Terminal.<br>Take an intercity \nbus bound for Pyeongchang via&nbsp;Jangpyeong.<br>Get off at Jangpyeong.<br><br>From Jangpyeong \nTerminal, take a bus bound for Yupo-ri. <br>Bus schedule: 6 times per day/ travel \ntime: 20min.&nbsp;\n","data":{"id":"2022-09-24-1663995422572","title":"Geumdanggyegok Valley (Í∏àÎãπÍ≥ÑÍ≥°)","description":"Geumdanggyegok Valley, located upstream of the Pyeongchanggang River, is a gorge between three different districts of Bongpyeong-myeon, Yongpyeong-myeon and Daehwa-myeon, just west of Geumdangsan Mountain (1,173 m).

The crystal clear waters of the Hantangang River wind around Goseokbawi Rock, a peculiarly shaped rock of about 10 meters tall that stands dominantly in the middle of the river. Goseokjeong Pavilion is a two-story tower-style pavilion that has an area of about 33 square meters, built halfway up the Hantangang River during the reign of King Jinpyeong (r. AD 579-632) of the Silla Kingdom. Today, Goseokjeong refers to the entire area around Goseokjeong Pavilion and the valley surrounding Goseok Rock. Designated as a Monument of Gangwon-do, the pavilion is known to have been one of the most favored places by King Jinpyeong of Silla Kingdom, and King Chungsuk of Goryeo dynasty. The area became all the more famous as the arena of Im Kkeok-jeong (?-1562), who was a legendary leader of a peasant rebellion in the early Joseon dynasty. <br><br>The pavilion was destroyed during the Korean War and restored in 1971 by community leaders in Cheorwon. Unfortunately, it was damaged once again by flood in 1996 and reconstructed the year after. There is a natural stone chamber inside Goseokbawi Rock that Im Kkeok-jeong used as a hiding place. On the opposite side, there are remains of a stone castle. Jiktang Waterfall is located about 2 kilometers up from this site, while Sundam Valley is situated about 2 kilometers in the downstream. Goseokjeong is a year-round tourist attraction with an extensive grass square and recreational facilities. It is also the starting point for DMZ tours as the Iron Triangle Battlefield Conservation Office is located here and in winter, visitors can enjoy migratory bird tour.","regDate":"2022-09-24","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Tourist Complexes"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-24-1664012586092/2567099_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-09-24-1664012586092"},{"id":"2022-09-24-1664009366328","title":"Gongjicheon Stream (Gold Scales Theme Street) (Í≥µÏßÄÏ≤ú(Ìô©Í∏àÎπÑÎäòÌÖåÎßàÍ±∞Î¶¨))","description":"The city of Chuncheon is surrounded by Uiamho, Chuncheonho, and Soyangho Lakes and is widely known as Lake City.
