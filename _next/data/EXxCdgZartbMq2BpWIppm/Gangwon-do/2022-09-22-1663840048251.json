It offers splendid scenery and many neighboring tourist attractions, such as Gugok Falls, Deungseon Falls, and Samaksan Mountain. It has excellent accessibility of public transportation, many theme park facilities, and accommodation facilities, so it has been a popular location for a young people’s membership trip from the 1970s to the 1990s. However, along with the opening of the double-track railway on the Gyeongchun Line in 2010, the Gangchon Station building was relocated and consequently, the number of visitors has decreased and the local business experienced depression. Therefore, there has been a campaign to revitalize Gangchon. Near the former Gangchon Station, the large sculpture “Ddo-ori Gangchon” has been installed, and the reduced-size model of the Deungseongyo Bridge (suspension bridge), which was a famous tourist attraction in the past, has been reproduced. In particular, “Ddo-ori Gangchon,” which is a popular photo zone, was built by embodying the Scaly-side Merganser (Mergus squamatus, Natural Monument No. 448), which come the area of Gangchon in winter. Additionally, the Deungseongyo Bridge, which was Korea’s first suspension bridge, but demolished in 1985, was reproduced as a tourist pedestrian bridge with a length of 58 m. Furthermore, Gangchon Land, which is a well-known theme park, and the activity of four-wheel motorcycle riding along the riverside, are also major tourist attractions in Gangchon.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-33-250-3896|\n|parking:|Not allowed|\n|restdate:|Open year round|\n|usetime:|00:00–24:00|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-09-22-1663840048251/1583492_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-22-1663840048251/1583492_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-22-1663840048251/2364894_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-22-1663840048251/2364894_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-33-250-3896](tel:+82332503896)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.8157038798\nlongitude: 127.6325486998\ntitle: The area of Namsan-myeon, Chuncheon-si, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Chuncheon Intercity Bus Terminal, take a local city bus headed for Seoul and get off at Gangchon Bus Stop. <br>\n<BR>\n[Train]<br>\nFrom Cheongnyangni Station take trains heading to Gangchon Station. <br>\nWalk for approx. 5 min.\n","data":{"id":"2022-09-22-1663840048251","title":"Gangchon Resort (강촌유원지)","description":"The Gangchon Resort, as one of Chuncheon’s major resorts, stretches along the Bukhangang River and the Gangchoncheon Stream.

The crystal clear waters of the Hantangang River wind around Goseokbawi Rock, a peculiarly shaped rock of about 10 meters tall that stands dominantly in the middle of the river. Goseokjeong Pavilion is a two-story tower-style pavilion that has an area of about 33 square meters, built halfway up the Hantangang River during the reign of King Jinpyeong (r. AD 579-632) of the Silla Kingdom. Today, Goseokjeong refers to the entire area around Goseokjeong Pavilion and the valley surrounding Goseok Rock. Designated as a Monument of Gangwon-do, the pavilion is known to have been one of the most favored places by King Jinpyeong of Silla Kingdom, and King Chungsuk of Goryeo dynasty. The area became all the more famous as the arena of Im Kkeok-jeong (?-1562), who was a legendary leader of a peasant rebellion in the early Joseon dynasty. <br><br>The pavilion was destroyed during the Korean War and restored in 1971 by community leaders in Cheorwon. Unfortunately, it was damaged once again by flood in 1996 and reconstructed the year after. There is a natural stone chamber inside Goseokbawi Rock that Im Kkeok-jeong used as a hiding place. On the opposite side, there are remains of a stone castle. Jiktang Waterfall is located about 2 kilometers up from this site, while Sundam Valley is situated about 2 kilometers in the downstream. Goseokjeong is a year-round tourist attraction with an extensive grass square and recreational facilities. It is also the starting point for DMZ tours as the Iron Triangle Battlefield Conservation Office is located here and in winter, visitors can enjoy migratory bird tour.","regDate":"2022-09-24","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Tourist Complexes"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-24-1664012586092/2567099_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-09-24-1664012586092"},{"id":"2022-09-24-1664009366328","title":"Gongjicheon Stream (Gold Scales Theme Street) (공지천(황금비늘테마거리))","description":"The city of Chuncheon is surrounded by Uiamho, Chuncheonho, and Soyangho Lakes and is widely known as Lake City.
