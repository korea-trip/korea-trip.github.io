Prior to the establishment of Gyeongin Railroad, this alley was Incheon‚Äôs representative road to Seoul, referred to as Ugakli Street. During the 60s and 70s when living was difficult and everything was hard to get one's hands on, it was the only secondhand bookstore alley in the Incheon area where people could quench their thirst for learning. Known as the Baedari Bookstore Alley, there are about 10 bookstores altogether within the area that sell secondhand books and new books. Countless books in a wide range of topics from ancient Korean literature, arts, music, medicine, children‚Äôs books, dictionaries and more fill up the small but charming bookstores.
