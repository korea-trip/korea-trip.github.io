The word ‚Äúdae‚Äù in Uisangdae refers to a building built at a vantage point for areas with beautiful scenery. Indeed, the view of the East Sea and the coast from Uisangdae Pavilion awarded its recognition as one of the Eight Sights of Yangyang, and a must-visit place for all visitors to Naksansa Temple. Jeong Cheol (pen-name  Songgang), a famed scholar and writer of the poem Song of Diamond Mountains, chose the pavilion as one of the Eight Sights of Gwandong, and the pavilion is today one of the popular sites for sunrise-viewing on the east coast of Korea. Together with Hongnyeonam Hermitage, it is designated as the Scenic Site No. 27 of Korea under the name ‚ÄúUisangdae Pavilion and Hongnyeonam Hermitage of Naksansa Temple, Yangyang.‚Äù Uisangdae is named after Uisang, a respected Silla-era Buddhist monk who is said to have founded this temple in 671 (11th year of King Munmu‚Äôs reign of Silla), and many stories of his deeds can still be found in the temple. For instance, Uisangdae is said to be the site where he meditated before founding Naksansa Temple at its present site. Today‚Äôs pavilion was restored to its present hexagonal form in 1995.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-33-672-2447|\n|opendate:|In 1995|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Summer season 04:00‚Äì20:00 / Winter season 05:30‚Äì18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Film Locations:|Filming site of the TV Show Taejo Wang Geon|\n|Available Facilities:|Uisangdae Pavilion, Naksansa Temple|\n|Activity Fees:|[Entrance Fees to Naksansa Temple‚Äôs Cultural Heritage]<br> Individual: Adults 4,000 won / Teenagers 1,500 won / Children 1,000 won<br> Group: Adult 3,000 won / Teenagers 1,000 won / Children 700 won|\n|Parking Fees:|4,000 won|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|None|\n|Reservation Info. for Foreigners:|None|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-10-16-1665910327005/483706_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-16-1665910327005/483706_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-16-1665910327005/483710_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-16-1665910327005/483710_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-16-1665910327005/678000_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-16-1665910327005/678000_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-16-1665910327005/678019_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-16-1665910327005/678019_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-16-1665910327005/678020_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-16-1665910327005/678020_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-16-1665910327005/2356894_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-16-1665910327005/2356894_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-16-1665910327005/678021_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-16-1665910327005/678021_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-16-1665910327005/678022_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-16-1665910327005/678022_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-16-1665910327005/2356912_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-16-1665910327005/2356912_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-33-672-2447](tel:+82336722447)\n- [üè†www.naksansa.or.kr](http://www.naksansa.or.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 38.1253701685\nlongitude: 128.6307430562\ntitle: 100, Naksansa-ro, Yangyang-gun, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Yangyang Intercity Bus Terminal Bus Stop, take Bus No. 9 and get off at Naksansa Temple Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-10-16-1665910327005","title":"Uisangdae Pavilion (ÎÇôÏÇ∞ÏÇ¨ ÏùòÏÉÅÎåÄ)","description":"This pavilion is located on a seaside cliff on the way from Yangyang‚Äôs Naksansa Temple to Gwaneumgul Cave of Hongnyeonam Hermitage.

Originally established as Baegamseonwon Temple in 973, the temple changed its name several times, went through construction works, and has become the current Cheongpyeongsa Temple. Yi Ja-hyeon, a scholar of the Goryeo period, built a garden here by keeping its natural topography after he left his government post. In this area, there is a pond that was built during the Goryeo period and has preserved its original form. Many cultural heritages have disappeared over the years and during the Korean War as well. The remaining cultural heritages include Hoejeonmun Gate of Cheongpyeongsa Temple (Treasure No. 164), Three-story Stone Pagoda of Cheongpyeongsa Temple (Gangwon-do Cultural Heritage Material No. 8), and Stupa of Yi Ja-hyeon (posthumous epithet  Jillakgong). Cheongpyeongsa Temple‚Äôs Hoejeonmun Gate was built instead of Sacheonwangmun Gate (the gate of the Four Guardian Kings), in order to enlighten people about the transmigration of souls. Cheongpyeongsa Temple bears a myth about a princess and a serpent. The princess suffered a lot from a serpent as she couldn‚Äôt get rid of it from her body. Then she came to Cheongpyeongsa Temple and prayed to the Buddha, and she became free from the serpent. Therefore, the Three-story Stone Pagoda of Cheongpyeongsa Temple is also called ‚ÄúPrincess Pagoda.‚Äù Although the scale of the temple is not large, it is known for beautiful natural landscape harmonized with artificial structures, such as a pavilion and a pond. Accordingly, the area of the temple was designated as Scenic Site No. 70. Cheongpyeongsa Temple can be also reached by taking a ferry at the Soyanggang Dam Quay.","regDate":"2022-10-22","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-22-1666424746299/1780622_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-22-1666424746299"},{"id":"2022-10-22-1666421910900","title":"Chuam Suspension Bridge (Ï∂îÏïî Ï∂úÎ†ÅÎã§Î¶¨)","description":"Chuam Suspension Bridge is located near Chotdae Rock, famous as a sunrise spot.
