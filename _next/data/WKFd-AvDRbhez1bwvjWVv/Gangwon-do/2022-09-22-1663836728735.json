Also known as Punch Bowl, Haean Basin is surrounded by high peaks and one of these peaks is Gachilbong. <br><br>The nature of the&nbsp;terrain in the Gachilbong area made it difficult to conduct military operations during the Korean War. The North Korean military utilized these natural features to build a solid defense position and launch counterattacks, while the South Korean soldiers in the lowland were in a disadvantageous position. South Korean soldiers were under the command of 5th Division Commander Brigadier General Min Gi-sik and 24th Regiment Commander Colonel Yu Ui-jun. On the North Korean side, the 7th, 14th, and 32nd Regiments of the 27th Division and the 23rd Regiment of the 12th Division under the  2nd Corps fought back. <br><br>By sending a&nbsp;military deployment and conducting search operations, the South Korean military completed a reconnaissance of the area on August 30 and advanced to counterattack. On August 31, after defending their position for two days, the South Korean soldiers were able to break the North Korean resistance. Each unit secured a strongly fortified position to&nbsp;draw the North Korean soldiers out. Thereafter, South Korea launched an all-out attack and captured&nbsp;Hill 1241. However, North Korea attacked again and South Korea retreated. After several attacks and counterattacks, South Korea was able to take back Gachilbong and the surrounding areas. Although it&nbsp;resulted in heavy casualties on both sides, this battle ultimately gave South Korea possession of Haean Basin.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-33-480-2675|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-09-22-1663836728735/2495056_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-22-1663836728735/2495056_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-22-1663836728735/2495058_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-22-1663836728735/2495058_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-22-1663836728735/2495059_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-22-1663836728735/2495059_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-22-1663836728735/2495062_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-22-1663836728735/2495062_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-33-480-2675](tel:+82334802675)\n- [üè†www.ygtour.kr](http://www.ygtour.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 38.2606113994\nlongitude: 128.1286456559\ntitle: Haean-myeon, Yanggu-gun, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus + Taxi]<BR>\nFrom Dong Seoul Bus Terminal, take an intercity bus to Yanggu Intercity Bus Terminal <br>\nFrom Yanggu Intercity Bus Terminal, take a taxi for approx. 45 min.\n","data":{"id":"2022-09-22-1663836728735","title":"Gachilbong Battlefield (Í∞ÄÏπ†Î¥âÏßÄÍµ¨Ï†ÑÌà¨Ï†ÑÏ†ÅÏßÄ)","description":"The entire town of Haean-myeon is contained in Haean Basin.

Originally established as Baegamseonwon Temple in 973, the temple changed its name several times, went through construction works, and has become the current Cheongpyeongsa Temple. Yi Ja-hyeon, a scholar of the Goryeo period, built a garden here by keeping its natural topography after he left his government post. In this area, there is a pond that was built during the Goryeo period and has preserved its original form. Many cultural heritages have disappeared over the years and during the Korean War as well. The remaining cultural heritages include Hoejeonmun Gate of Cheongpyeongsa Temple (Treasure No. 164), Three-story Stone Pagoda of Cheongpyeongsa Temple (Gangwon-do Cultural Heritage Material No. 8), and Stupa of Yi Ja-hyeon (posthumous epithet  Jillakgong). Cheongpyeongsa Temple‚Äôs Hoejeonmun Gate was built instead of Sacheonwangmun Gate (the gate of the Four Guardian Kings), in order to enlighten people about the transmigration of souls. Cheongpyeongsa Temple bears a myth about a princess and a serpent. The princess suffered a lot from a serpent as she couldn‚Äôt get rid of it from her body. Then she came to Cheongpyeongsa Temple and prayed to the Buddha, and she became free from the serpent. Therefore, the Three-story Stone Pagoda of Cheongpyeongsa Temple is also called ‚ÄúPrincess Pagoda.‚Äù Although the scale of the temple is not large, it is known for beautiful natural landscape harmonized with artificial structures, such as a pavilion and a pond. Accordingly, the area of the temple was designated as Scenic Site No. 70. Cheongpyeongsa Temple can be also reached by taking a ferry at the Soyanggang Dam Quay.","regDate":"2022-10-22","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-22-1666424746299/1780622_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-22-1666424746299"},{"id":"2022-10-22-1666421910900","title":"Chuam Suspension Bridge (Ï∂îÏïî Ï∂úÎ†ÅÎã§Î¶¨)","description":"Chuam Suspension Bridge is located near Chotdae Rock, famous as a sunrise spot.
