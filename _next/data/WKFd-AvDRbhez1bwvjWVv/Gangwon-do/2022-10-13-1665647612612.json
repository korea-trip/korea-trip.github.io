{"pageProps":{"content":"![Sokcho Lighthouse Observatory (속초등대전망대)](/2022-10-13-1665647612612/2711170_image2_1.webp)\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> It is No. 1 of Sokcho’s Eight Sights. This white lighthouse creates a picturesque view along with the surrounding blue sea. Sokcho Lighthouse Observatory was originally just a lighthouse, but now, it is opened to the public and plays a role of an observatory. Walking up along the wooden deck trail among the bamboo grove leads you to the observatory, which offers an open view of the deep blue East Sea, the Cheongchoho Lake, which is home to migratory birds, and the magnificent scenery of Seoraksan Mountain. Viewed from the high tower, the East Sea unfolds its boundless ocean and sometimes it looks like a calm lake but can become an energetic ocean full of vitality. Built in 1957, Sokcho Lighthouse still lights up for ships at night. The bright light and sound of the beacon, which has been in service since the lighthouse’s establishment, can show the waterway to a boat, which is about 35 km away from the lighthouse. Right next to the observatory, Yeonggeumjeong Pavilion is situated.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-33-633-3406|\n|parking:|Available (10 spaces)|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Summer season (April–October) 06:00–20:00<br />Winter season (November–March) 07:00–18:00<br />Exhibition Hall & Observatory 09:00–18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Activity Fees:|Free of charge|\n|Available Facilities:|Observatory|\n|Parking Fees:|Free of charge|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|None|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-10-13-1665647612612/182603_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-13-1665647612612/182603_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-13-1665647612612/676940_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-13-1665647612612/676940_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-13-1665647612612/677047_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-13-1665647612612/677047_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-13-1665647612612/677054_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-13-1665647612612/677054_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-13-1665647612612/2711171_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-13-1665647612612/2711171_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-13-1665647612612/2711172_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-13-1665647612612/2711172_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-33-633-3406](tel:+82336333406)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 38.2137204042\nlongitude: 128.6000930800\ntitle: 8-28, Yeonggeumjeong-ro 5-gil, Sokcho-si, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Express/Intercity Bus]<br>\nTake a bus from Dong Seoul Bus Terminal to Sokcho Express Bus Terminal.<br><br>\n\n[Bus]<br>\nGet off at Yeonggeumjeong Entrance Bus Stop.<br>\nBus No. 1, 1-1, 3, 3-1, 7, 9, 9-1, 9-2, 13-1, 13-2, 15, 16, 18, 19, 22<br>\nApprox. 5min-walk to the lighthouse\n","data":{"id":"2022-10-13-1665647612612","title":"Sokcho Lighthouse Observatory (속초등대전망대)","description":"It is No. 1 of Sokcho’s Eight Sights.

Originally established as Baegamseonwon Temple in 973, the temple changed its name several times, went through construction works, and has become the current Cheongpyeongsa Temple. Yi Ja-hyeon, a scholar of the Goryeo period, built a garden here by keeping its natural topography after he left his government post. In this area, there is a pond that was built during the Goryeo period and has preserved its original form. Many cultural heritages have disappeared over the years and during the Korean War as well. The remaining cultural heritages include Hoejeonmun Gate of Cheongpyeongsa Temple (Treasure No. 164), Three-story Stone Pagoda of Cheongpyeongsa Temple (Gangwon-do Cultural Heritage Material No. 8), and Stupa of Yi Ja-hyeon (posthumous epithet  Jillakgong). Cheongpyeongsa Temple’s Hoejeonmun Gate was built instead of Sacheonwangmun Gate (the gate of the Four Guardian Kings), in order to enlighten people about the transmigration of souls. Cheongpyeongsa Temple bears a myth about a princess and a serpent. The princess suffered a lot from a serpent as she couldn’t get rid of it from her body. Then she came to Cheongpyeongsa Temple and prayed to the Buddha, and she became free from the serpent. Therefore, the Three-story Stone Pagoda of Cheongpyeongsa Temple is also called “Princess Pagoda.” Although the scale of the temple is not large, it is known for beautiful natural landscape harmonized with artificial structures, such as a pavilion and a pond. Accordingly, the area of the temple was designated as Scenic Site No. 70. Cheongpyeongsa Temple can be also reached by taking a ferry at the Soyanggang Dam Quay.","regDate":"2022-10-22","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-22-1666424746299/1780622_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-22-1666424746299"},{"id":"2022-10-22-1666421910900","title":"Chuam Suspension Bridge (추암 출렁다리)","description":"Chuam Suspension Bridge is located near Chotdae Rock, famous as a sunrise spot.
