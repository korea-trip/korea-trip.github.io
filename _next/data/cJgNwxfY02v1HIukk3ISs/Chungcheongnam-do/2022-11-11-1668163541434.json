{"pageProps":{"content":"![Oseosan Mountain (오서산)](/2022-11-11-1668163541434/2675819_image2_1.webp)\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> With an altitude of 790 meters, Oseosan Mountain in Boryeong is one of the highest peaks on Korea’s west coast. From the summit, visitors can see waves of silver grass, a feature that makes the mountain popular for hiking. The mountain is also popular among hikers traveling by train as the entrance to the mountain is only 4 kilometers away from Gwangcheon Station. The biggest draw of the mountain, however, is the birds-eye-view of the west coast that comes into view on the way to the summit. Another attraction within the mountain range is Jeongamsa Temple.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-41-930-4060,<br>+82-41-930-0805, +82-41-936-5465|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Open 24 hr|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Admission applies to Oseosan National Recreational Forest|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-11-1668163541434/1602799_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668163541434/1602799_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-11-1668163541434/1602800_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668163541434/1602800_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-11-1668163541434/1602801_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668163541434/1602801_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-11-1668163541434/1602802_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668163541434/1602802_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-11-1668163541434/1602803_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668163541434/1602803_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-11-1668163541434/1602804_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668163541434/1602804_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-11-1668163541434/2675814_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668163541434/2675814_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-11-1668163541434/2675817_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668163541434/2675817_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-41-930-4060](tel:+82419304060)\n- [🏠www.brcn.go.kr](http://www.brcn.go.kr/tour.do)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.4561379434\nlongitude: 126.6542641018\ntitle: Seongyeon-ri, Boryeong-si, Chungcheongnam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Train + Bus]<br>\nTake the train from Yongsan Station to Gwangcheon Station. <br> From Gwangcheon Station, take a local bus to Oseosan Mountain Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-11-1668163541434","title":"Oseosan Mountain (오서산)","description":"With an altitude of 790 meters, Oseosan Mountain in Boryeong is one of the highest peaks on Korea’s west coast.
