He was a great national hero who led the Korean navy to victory in many naval battles using innovative ‘turtle ships’ during the Imjin War (1592-1598).\n <br><br>\nSituated in the heart of Gumisan Mountain overlooking the city of Jeongeup, the temple is the location of a memorial ceremony held every 28th of April, the birthday of Admiral Yi. The ceremony is meant to pay tribute to the memory of the naval hero and his irreproachable service to the city. Yi Sun-Sin had been appointed as reeve of Jeongeup in 1589 but soon after in 1591 he left the post to work as the chief naval officer of the Jeolla region.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-63-539-5184|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-31-1659275032648/1277531_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659275032648/1277531_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659275032648/1277533_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659275032648/1277533_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659275032648/1277535_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659275032648/1277535_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659275032648/1277544_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659275032648/1277544_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659275032648/1277545_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659275032648/1277545_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659275032648/1277546_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659275032648/1277546_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659275032648/1277548_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659275032648/1277548_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659275032648/1277549_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659275032648/1277549_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659275032648/1277551_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659275032648/1277551_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659275032648/1277552_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659275032648/1277552_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-63-539-5184](tel:+82635395184)\n- [🏠culture.jeongeup.go.kr](http://culture.jeongeup.go.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.5699231800\nlongitude: 126.8575744838\ntitle: 228-13, Chungjeong-ro, Jeongeup-si, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Seoul Express Bus Terminal, take an intercity bus to Jeongeup Bus Terminal.<br>\nFrom Jeongeup Bus Terminal, walk approx. 400 m towards Jeongeup City Hall.<br>\nTurn left towards Jeongeup City Hall, and walk approx. 200 m forward.\nTurn right at Seosong-gil Road, and walk approx. 600 m forward to arrive at Chungryeolsa Temple.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-31-1659275032648","title":"Chungnyeolsa Temple (충렬사)","description":"Located in Jeongeup, Jeollabuk-do, Chungnyeolsa Temple was established as a shrine to embody the spirit of Admiral “Chungmugong” (honorific title in military) Yi Sun-Sin.
