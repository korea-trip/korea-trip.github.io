A large crater, formed by the hot lava mixing with cold ocean water, is located at the top of Seongsan Ilchulbong Tuff Cone. The crater is about 600 meters in diameter and 90 meters deep. It has been featured in films, and was originally used for agriculture, but has now been given over to a field of silver grass. From the summit, visitors can see Udo Island, as well as take in the magnificent sunrise.
