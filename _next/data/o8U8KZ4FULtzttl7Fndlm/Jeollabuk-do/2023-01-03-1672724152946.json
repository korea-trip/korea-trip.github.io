The two Buddha statues (each measuring 424 cm) stand face-to-face at a distance of 200 meters apart and tell the story of an eternal, but unrequited love. <br><br>According to legend, the two Buddhas (one male, one female) are lovers that can only meet for one night in the twelfth month of the lunar calendar. After the sunset on that special day, the lovers are allowed to meet, but must return to their respective positions before the rooster crows at dawn. <br><br>The two statues are very representative of the Goryeo era, which produced many stone statues with minimal expression of the physical body. True to the era, each Buddha has almost no curves and is depicted with plain clothing and barely distinguishable arms. <br><br>On their heads, the Buddhas wear a crown topped with another square hat. With their square faces, small eyes, pug noses, and small lips, the Buddhas are reminiscent of guardian deities typically placed at the entrance of villages.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-63-859-5792|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-03-1672724152946/1308501_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-03-1672724152946/1308501_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-03-1672724152946/1308521_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-03-1672724152946/1308521_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-03-1672724152946/1308525_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-03-1672724152946/1308525_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-03-1672724152946/1308531_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-03-1672724152946/1308531_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-03-1672724152946/2513759_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-03-1672724152946/2513759_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-03-1672724152946/2513761_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-03-1672724152946/2513761_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-03-1672724152946/2513764_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-03-1672724152946/2513764_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-03-1672724152946/2513765_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-03-1672724152946/2513765_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-03-1672724152946/2513766_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-03-1672724152946/2513766_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-03-1672724152946/1308506_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-03-1672724152946/1308506_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-63-859-5792](tel:+82638595792)\n- [üè† www.iksan.go.kr</a> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br><a href=\"http://www.cha.go.kr\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"web\">www.cha.go.kr](http://www.iksan.go.kr/tour)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.9793521593\nlongitude: 127.0518632485\ntitle: Donggodo-ri, Geumma-myeon, Iksan-si, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Iksan Station\n<br>\n-Take Bus 65 or 65-1 and get off at Cheonma-dong Bus Stop.<br><br>Or, \n<br><br>-Take Bus 41, 60, 61, 62, 63 or 64 to Geumma Terminal.

Hanok houses are generally divided into two sections, <em>anchae</em> and <em>sarangchae</em>. Sarangchae is where the men dwell. Because men and women had to remain separated, anchae is situated deep inside the house so that it is secretive and quiet. <br /><br />Another trait of hanok is that all the houses are heated with ondol, a unique floor heating system. Since Koreans enjoy sitting, eating, and sleeping on the floor, it needs to remain heated in winter. To experience what hanok is like, visitors can either book a hanok accommodation or visit the Hanok Life Experience Hall.","regDate":"2023-01-04","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Folk Villages"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-04-1672824967328/2674220_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-04-1672824967328"},{"id":"2023-01-04-1672821551267","title":"Jeonju Donggosa Temple (ÎèôÍ≥†ÏÇ¨ (Ï†ÑÏ£º))","description":"Donggosa Temple, located on Seungamsan Mountain in Jeonju, is a Buddhist temple of the Taego Order.
