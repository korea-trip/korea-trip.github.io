Historical relics from the Later Goguryeo period, including the site of a fortress for Gung Ye (the first king of the short-lived Later Goguryeo state) can be seen on the mountain. Majestic peaks surround Mangyeongdae, the main peak, and forests of broad-leaved trees turn striking colors in the fall. \n<br><br>\nThe trails are beautiful with purple magnolias in mid-April and azaleas and mountain magnolias in May. The Unaksan Mountain Autumn Leaves Festival is held in mid-October every year as the leaves begin to turn.
