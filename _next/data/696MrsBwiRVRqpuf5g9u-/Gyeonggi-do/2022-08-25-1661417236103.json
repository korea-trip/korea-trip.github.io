The king and queen are enshrined separately. The tomb on the left is King Sejo‚Äôs and the one on the right is Queen Jeonhui‚Äôs with a pavilion standing between the two tombs.

It is famous for being the habitat of the Korean redheaded woodpecker (Natural Monument No. 11).\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-31-527-7105|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|Mondays|\n|usetime:|November-January 09:00-17:30<BR>February-May, September-October 09:00-18:00<br>June-August 09:00-18:30<br>* Last admission is 1 hour before closing.|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Gwangneung Historical Museum, mineral spring, drinking fountain, benches, etc.|\n|Admission Fees:|[General admission]<br /> Individuals: Adults 1,000 won / Children & Teenagers 500 won<br /> Groups: Adults 800 won / Children & Teenagers 400 won<br /> <br />  * Groups: 10 or more people <br />* Adults (ages 19-64) / Children & Teenagers (ages 7-18) <br />* Free admission: Preschoolers (ages 6 & under) and senior citizens (ages 65 & over)<br />* ID must be presented at the ticket box. <br /> <br />[Other passes]<br />Hourly pass: 30,000 won<br />* Viewing hours 12:00-13:00 <br />* Valid for 1 year <br /><br />Lunch pass: 3,000 won<br />* Viewing hours12:00-14:00 (last admission is at 13:00)<br />* Limited to 10 times <br /><br />Monthly pass: 10,000 won<br /> * Visitors may enter freely within operating hours<br />* Valid for 1 month<br /><br /> [Free entry]<br /> * All visitors on the last Wednesday of each month (Culture Day). <br /> * Visitors wearing hanbok.|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Unavailable|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-25-1661417236103/2364478_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-25-1661417236103/2364478_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-25-1661417236103/2364480_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-25-1661417236103/2364480_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-25-1661417236103/2364481_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-25-1661417236103/2364481_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-31-527-7105](tel:+82315277105)\n- [üè†royaltombs.cha.go.kr](http://royaltombs.cha.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.7528333807\nlongitude: 127.1767420667\ntitle: 354, Gwangneungsumogwon-ro, Namyangju-si, Gyeonggi-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nCheongnyangni Station (Seoul Subway Line 1), Exit 4. <br>\nTake Bus No. 707 and get off at Gwangneungnae Terminal Bus Stop.<br> Transfer to Bus No. 21 and get off at Gwangneung Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-25-1661417236103","title":"Gwangneung Royal Tomb [UNESCO World Heritage] (ÎÇ®ÏñëÏ£º Í¥ëÎ¶â(ÏÑ∏Ï°∞, Ï†ïÌù¨ÏôïÌõÑ) [Ïú†ÎÑ§Ïä§ÏΩî ÏÑ∏Í≥ÑÎ¨∏ÌôîÏú†ÏÇ∞])","description":"Gwangneung, located in Namyangju in Gyeonggi-do is the royal tomb of King Sejo (1417-1468, reign 1455-1468) and Queen Jeonghui (1418-1483).
