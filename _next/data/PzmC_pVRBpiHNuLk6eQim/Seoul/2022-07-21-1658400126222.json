It was one of four mini-gates in the north surrounding the walled city of Hanyang (Seoul) during the Joseon dynasty. After the closure of Sukjeongmun Gate, one of the four main gates, Changuimun Gate became a favorite north gate. Hence, people also called Changuimun the North Gate. It is the only gate among four mini gates that is still in its original state. Although it is small, almost 50m² in terms of size, it looks very firm and sturdy. While Dongsomun Gate, another of the four mini gates, is decorated with a phoenix, Changuimun Gate is adorned with a wooden chicken along its rafters. The reason behind the wooden chicken was that the chicken was believed to be the nemesis of the centipede. People believed that installing the wooden chicken was important to overcome the harmful spirit of the centipede.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-2-2148-1822|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-21-1658400126222/1570522_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658400126222/1570522_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658400126222/1570523_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658400126222/1570523_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658400126222/1570524_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658400126222/1570524_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658400126222/1570525_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658400126222/1570525_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658400126222/1570527_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658400126222/1570527_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658400126222/1570528_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658400126222/1570528_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658400126222/2530882_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658400126222/2530882_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658400126222/2530883_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658400126222/2530883_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658400126222/2530893_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658400126222/2530893_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658400126222/2530895_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658400126222/2530895_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-2-2148-1822](tel:+82221481822)\n- [🏠tour.jongno.go.kr](http://tour.jongno.go.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5926982124\nlongitude: 126.9665047068\ntitle: 118, Changuimun-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway + Bus]<br>\nGyeongbokgung Station (Seoul Subway Line 3), Exit 3.<br>\nWalk straight 146m to the second bus stop.<br>\nTake Bus No. 1020, 7022 or 7212 and get off at Jahamun Pass.Yoon Dongju Literary Hall Bus Stop.<br>\nChanguimun Gate will be on the right up the short walkway.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-21-1658400126222","title":"Changuimun Gate - Jahamun Gate (창의문(자하문))","description":"Changuimun Gate was often called Jahamun Gate.

Heunginjimun Gate was the gate on the east side of the outer wall of Seoul Fortress among eight gates. It is referred to as Dongdaemun Gate as well. The gate was constructed during King Taejo’s 5th year in 1396, remodeled during the reign of King Danjong in 1453 and was newly built in 1869 during the sixth year of King Gojong’s reign in 1869. <br><br>The gate features a hipped roof which has five front compartments and two side compartments on a two-storied building. The thin and weak bracket system supports the eaves and is excessively decorated, reflecting the construction features of the late Joseon period. Also, outside of the fortress is the half-circle shaped Ongseong, a small wall, to protect the gate.<br><br>One of the unique factors of Heunginjimun Gate is that it is the only gate among Seoul’s eight to have Ongseong, further exhibiting the style of construction used during the late Joseon period as well.","regDate":"2022-08-02","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Gates"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-02-1659451203684/1568436_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-08-02-1659451203684"},{"id":"2022-08-02-1659449347832","title":"Heoninneung Royal Tombs Ecological Preservation Area (Alder Tree Forests) (헌인릉 생태경관보전지역(오리나무림))","description":"Heonninneung Royal Tombs Ecological Preservation Area is home to alder tree forests.
