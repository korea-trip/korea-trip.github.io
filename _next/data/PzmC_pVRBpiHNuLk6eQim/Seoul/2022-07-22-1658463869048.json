Lee Seong-rye, the mother of Father Thomas Choi Yang-eop (Korea's second ordained priest), has not yet been canonized although she did suffer martyrdom. The reason was that the mother briefly put aside her faith because of the pressures of raising five children after she had her oldest son, Thomas. However, \nthe difficulty of combining these two interests was eventually overcome and she died a martyr.<br>\n\n<br>Aside from serving as a memorial site, Danggogae Catholic Martyrs' Shrine also offers a commanding view of Seoul. Nearby tourist attractions include Saenamteo Catholic Holy Place of the Martyrs, which is a Catholic church with Korean architecture, and Yongsan Family Park.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-2-711-0933|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-22-1658463869048/566487_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-22-1658463869048/566487_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-22-1658463869048/566488_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-22-1658463869048/566488_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-22-1658463869048/566489_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-22-1658463869048/566489_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-22-1658463869048/566490_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-22-1658463869048/566490_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-2-711-0933](tel:+8227110933)\n- [🏠www.danggogae.org</a> (Korean only)<br /><a title=\"New window popup\" href=\"http://www.yongsan.go.kr/\" target=\"_blank\">www.yongsan.go.kr/](http://www.danggogae.org/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5355770817\nlongitude: 126.9669951674\ntitle: 139-26, Cheongpa-ro, Yongsan-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway + Bus]<BR>\nYongsan Station (Gyeongbu Line & Seoul Subway Line 1 & Jungang Line), Exit 3.<BR> Take the footbridge connecting Exit 3 to the Terminal Electronics Market.<br>\n Exit through the front of the Terminal Electronics Market and walk toward the parking lot across the street from the building.<BR> Walk along the right side of this parking lot until you reach Yongsan Jeonjasangga Sageori (four-way intersection). <BR>Turn right and walk for about 300m.<br>\n Turn left just before the elevated road overpass.<br>\n Walk straight ahead until the end of this street to arrive at the site.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-22-1658463869048","title":"Danggogae Catholic Martyrs' Shrine (당고개순교성지)","description":"Danggogae Catholic Martyrs' Shrine is located on the small hill just five minutes away from Yongsan Eletronics Market. 10 Catholics were martyred on this hill during the Gihae Persecution in 1839 including Choi Gyeong-hwan (Francis)'s wife Lee Seong-rye (Maria).<br><br>Nine of the 10 martyrs are now recognized as saints.

In 1922 when the Japanese colonial government sold buildings of Gyeonghuigung Palace to the public to build Gyeongseong Middle School in the location, the Hwanghakjeong Pavilion was bought and restored at the current location, which is an old site of Deunggwajeong Pavilion located to the North of Sajik Park.<br><br>It is relatively large for a pavilion, but the structure is plain and simple. There is a well behind the pavilion to the southwest. A rock behind the well has an engraved poem about eight beautiful scenes of Hwanghakjeong. Located to the right of the pavilion building (northeast of the building) is Hancheongak Pavilion, which has unique roof. To the west of the pavilion is Sauhoegwan Hall that was built with reinforced concrete.","regDate":"2022-08-02","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Palaces"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-02-1659468989162/1568125_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-08-02-1659468989162"},{"id":"2022-08-02-1659459694027","title":"Hongneung Arboretum (홍릉수목원)","description":"Hongneung Arboretum was the first arboretum in Korea, established in 1922 when experimental forests were built on Hongneung Royal Tomb, the burial mound of Queen Myeong-Seong.

Heunginjimun Gate was the gate on the east side of the outer wall of Seoul Fortress among eight gates. It is referred to as Dongdaemun Gate as well. The gate was constructed during King Taejo’s 5th year in 1396, remodeled during the reign of King Danjong in 1453 and was newly built in 1869 during the sixth year of King Gojong’s reign in 1869. <br><br>The gate features a hipped roof which has five front compartments and two side compartments on a two-storied building. The thin and weak bracket system supports the eaves and is excessively decorated, reflecting the construction features of the late Joseon period. Also, outside of the fortress is the half-circle shaped Ongseong, a small wall, to protect the gate.<br><br>One of the unique factors of Heunginjimun Gate is that it is the only gate among Seoul’s eight to have Ongseong, further exhibiting the style of construction used during the late Joseon period as well.","regDate":"2022-08-02","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Gates"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-02-1659451203684/1568436_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-08-02-1659451203684"},{"id":"2022-08-02-1659449347832","title":"Heoninneung Royal Tombs Ecological Preservation Area (Alder Tree Forests) (헌인릉 생태경관보전지역(오리나무림))","description":"Heonninneung Royal Tombs Ecological Preservation Area is home to alder tree forests.
