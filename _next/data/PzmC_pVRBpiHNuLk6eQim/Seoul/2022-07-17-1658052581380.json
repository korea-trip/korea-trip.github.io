In 1922 when the Japanese colonial government sold buildings of Gyeonghuigung Palace to the public to build Gyeongseong Middle School in the location, the Hwanghakjeong Pavilion was bought and restored at the current location, which is an old site of Deunggwajeong Pavilion located to the North of Sajik Park.<br><br>It is relatively large for a pavilion, but the structure is plain and simple. There is a well behind the pavilion to the southwest. A rock behind the well has an engraved poem about eight beautiful scenes of Hwanghakjeong. Located to the right of the pavilion building (northeast of the building) is Hancheongak Pavilion, which has unique roof. To the west of the pavilion is Sauhoegwan Hall that was built with reinforced concrete.","regDate":"2022-08-02","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Palaces"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-02-1659468989162/1568125_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-08-02-1659468989162"},{"id":"2022-08-02-1659459694027","title":"Hongneung Arboretum (홍릉수목원)","description":"Hongneung Arboretum was the first arboretum in Korea, established in 1922 when experimental forests were built on Hongneung Royal Tomb, the burial mound of Queen Myeong-Seong.

Heunginjimun Gate was the gate on the east side of the outer wall of Seoul Fortress among eight gates. It is referred to as Dongdaemun Gate as well. The gate was constructed during King Taejo’s 5th year in 1396, remodeled during the reign of King Danjong in 1453 and was newly built in 1869 during the sixth year of King Gojong’s reign in 1869. <br><br>The gate features a hipped roof which has five front compartments and two side compartments on a two-storied building. The thin and weak bracket system supports the eaves and is excessively decorated, reflecting the construction features of the late Joseon period. Also, outside of the fortress is the half-circle shaped Ongseong, a small wall, to protect the gate.<br><br>One of the unique factors of Heunginjimun Gate is that it is the only gate among Seoul’s eight to have Ongseong, further exhibiting the style of construction used during the late Joseon period as well.","regDate":"2022-08-02","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Gates"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-02-1659451203684/1568436_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-08-02-1659451203684"},{"id":"2022-08-02-1659449347832","title":"Heoninneung Royal Tombs Ecological Preservation Area (Alder Tree Forests) (헌인릉 생태경관보전지역(오리나무림))","description":"Heonninneung Royal Tombs Ecological Preservation Area is home to alder tree forests.
