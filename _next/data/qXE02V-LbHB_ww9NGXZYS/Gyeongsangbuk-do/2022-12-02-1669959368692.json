When a small neighborhood in Jirye-ri, Imdong-myeon was at the risk of flood due to the dam, Kim Won-gil, the current village leader, relocated and rebuilt ten houses to its current location in 1986. This neighborhood, now known as Jirye Arts Village, was designated as an art village in 1990 and since then, many artists settled in the neighborhood and formed a community of culture and art. Today, Jirye Arts Village offers a variety of opportunities to experience Korean culture through hands-on arts and crafts as well as diverse cultural activities.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-54-852-1913|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Hiking Course:|Variety show 1 Night, 2 Days|\n|Available Facilities:|Accommodations, walking path, playground, etc.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-02-1669959368692/187004_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-02-1669959368692/187004_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-02-1669959368692/187006_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-02-1669959368692/187006_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-02-1669959368692/187009_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-02-1669959368692/187009_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-02-1669959368692/187005_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-02-1669959368692/187005_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-02-1669959368692/187007_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-02-1669959368692/187007_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-02-1669959368692/187008_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-02-1669959368692/187008_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-02-1669959368692/2533847_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-02-1669959368692/2533847_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-02-1669959368692/2533848_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-02-1669959368692/2533848_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-02-1669959368692/2533850_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-02-1669959368692/2533850_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-02-1669959368692/2533851_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-02-1669959368692/2533851_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-54-852-1913](tel:+82548521913)\n- [üè†www.jirye.com](http://www.jirye.com)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.5100511642\nlongitude: 128.9508713825\ntitle: 427, Jiryeyesulchon-gil, Andong-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Train + taxi]<BR>\nFrom Andong Station, take a taxi to Jirye Arts Village.\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-02-1669959368692","title":"Jirye Arts Village (ÏßÄÎ°ÄÏòàÏà†Ï¥å)","description":"Located in Andong, Jirye Arts Village first formed as a result of the construction of Imha Dam.
