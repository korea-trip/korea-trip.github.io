After its decline, part of it was annexed by Silla (57 BC ~ AD 935), and the rest annexed by Baekjae (18 BC~AD 60), and became a forgotten tribal kingdom. <br>On King Jinheung‚Äôs (reign 540~576) 23rd year of reign it became the district of Daegaya, and the name was changed to the district of Goryeong on King Gyeongdeok‚Äôs (reign 742~765) 16th year of reign.<br>This is the place where you can view the country‚Äôs first Sunjangmyo (tomb where many dead people were buried together), called Jisandong Gobungun, Daegaya Royal Tomb Exhibit Hall, and Treasure No. 605, the pre-eminent relics site of the Prehistoric Period called Yangjeondong Amgakhwa, and other various cultural assets.<br>There is a large, ancient tomb with a diameter of 20m, built on the ridgeline of the mountain, and as you go down the mountain, there are 159 other tombs of smaller scale.
