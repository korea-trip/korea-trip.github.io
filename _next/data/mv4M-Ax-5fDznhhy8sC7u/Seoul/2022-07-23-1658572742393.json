The 4.48-meter-high pagoda is made of granite, and is called “Kang Gam-chan Tap (pagoda)” or “Kang Gam-chan Nakseongdae Tap”. \n<br><br>\n*Anguksa Shrine<br>\nAnguksa is a shrine built in 1974 emulating the wooden architecture style of the Goryeo era. The shrine has high ceilings and houses the portrait of General Kang Gam-chan. The shrine is located on the road leading to the back gate of Seoul National University and has become a popular place in the area. \n<br><br>\n*Nakseongdae Yuji <br>\nNakseongdae Yuji is the birthplace of General Kang Gam-chan and the original location of the three-story pagoda.
