Gyeongbokgung Palace is arguably the most beautiful, and remains the largest of all five palaces. <br /><br />The premises were once destroyed by fire during the Imjin War (1592-1598). However, all of the palace buildings were later restored under the leadership of Heungseondaewongun during the reign of King Gojong (1852-1919). <br /><br />Remarkably, the most representative edifices of the Joseon dynasty, Gyeonghoeru Pavilion and the pond around Hyangwonjeong Pavilion have remained relatively intact. The raised dias and stone markers of Geunjeongjeon showcase the representative art style of their time.<br /><br />The National Palace Museum of Korea is located outside of Heungnyemun Gate, and the National Folk Museum is located on the eastern side of Hyangwonjeong Pavillion.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-2-3700-3900|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|Tuesdays|\n|usetime:|November-February 09:00-17:00<br>March-May 09:00-18:00<BR>June-August 09:00-18:30<BR>September-October 09:00-18:00<BR><br>* Last admission one hour before closing<br>* Operating hours are subject to change due to unforeseen circumstances|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|First two hours: Small vehicles 3,000 won / Large vehicles 5,000 won <br>* 800 won for each additional 10 minutes<br>* Free for vehicles leaving within 30 minutes|\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 3,000 won / Children 1,500 won<br>Groups - Adults 2,400 won / Children 1,200 won<br><br>* Adults (ages 19-64) / Children (ages 7-18)<br>* Groups: 10 people or more<br>* Free admission: Preschoolers (ages 6 and younger), senior citizens (ages 65 and older), people wearing hanbok, all visitors on the last Wednesday of every month (Culture Day)|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Tours depart from in front of the information center at Heungnyemun Gate. <br>- Duration: About 1 hr - 1 hr 30 min<br>- Tour Schedule<br> English -  11:00, 13:30, 15:30<br> Japanese - 10:00, 14:30<br> Chinese - 10:30, 15:00<br>Indonesian (Friday-Saturday) - 14:30<br>Vietnamese (Friday-Saturday) - 10:30<br>Spanish (Friday-Saturday): 10:30, 15:00|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-23-1658595062438/1568037_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658595062438/1568037_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658595062438/1568039_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658595062438/1568039_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658595062438/1568042_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658595062438/1568042_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658595062438/1568044_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658595062438/1568044_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658595062438/1568139_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658595062438/1568139_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658595062438/1994234_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658595062438/1994234_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658595062438/2005761_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658595062438/2005761_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658595062438/2005767_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658595062438/2005767_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658595062438/2005773_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658595062438/2005773_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658595062438/2612884_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658595062438/2612884_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-2-3700-3900](tel:+82237003900)\n- [üè†www.royalpalace.go.kr</a><br><a href=\"http://www.palaceguide.or.kr/\" target=\"_blank\">www.palaceguide.or.kr</a><br><a href=\"http://www.rekor.or.kr/\" target=\"_blank\">www.rekor.or.kr</a><br><a href=\"https://ticket.11st.co.kr/Product/Detail?id=265070\" target=\"_blank\">ticket.11st.co.kr](http://www.royalpalace.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5788222356\nlongitude: 126.9769930325\ntitle: 161, Sajik-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-23-1658595062438","title":"Gyeongbokgung Palace (Í≤ΩÎ≥µÍ∂Å)","description":"Built in 1395, Gyeongbokgung Palace is commonly referred to as the Northern Palace because its location is furthest north when compared to the neighboring palaces of Changdeokgung (Eastern Palace) and Gyeonghuigung (Western Palace).
