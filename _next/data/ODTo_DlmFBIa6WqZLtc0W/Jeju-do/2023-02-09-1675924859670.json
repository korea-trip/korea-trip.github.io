Created particularly close to the earth‚Äôs surface, this cave has a number of entrance holes to the tunnel. Inside, the complex structure of the cave unfolds in the form of double-tiered or triple-tiered rooms.

Legend has it that the pond was created by the water raining down off of a dragon that ascended to heaven.

When he fell down, his body immediately sank into the ocean and his head rapidly froze looking at the sky. Another legend has it that a white horse, who dreamed of being a dragon and ascending to the sky, came to be caught by a soldier and froze into the rock.<br><br>From Yongduam Rock, visitors can see haenyeo (female divers) working at catching seafood.

It starts from Yeongsil Rest Area and follows a relatively gentle slope lined with beautiful trees and autumn foliage for about one kilometer.<br> After that, an uphill path emerges along steep mountain ridges. The deep Yeongsilgyegok Valley and vast rock walls could be the result of a large volcano entrance in the past. After passing Byeongpungbawi Rock, the path becomes relatively flat until Witsaeoruem Rest Area. The first attraction of Yeongsil is a group of volcanic rocks collectively called Yeongsilgiam. These oddly shaped rocks are situated to the right of a big valley at 1,400 meters to 1,600 meters above sea level, soaring upwards towards the sky. Pass by Sajebi Hill to get a glass of mineral spring water, and  reach Eorimok to take the path downwards.","regDate":"2023-02-14","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites","National Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-14-1676364076313/2617909_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-14-1676364076313"},{"id":"2023-02-14-1676360164390","title":"Yeomiji Botanical Garden (Ïó¨ÎØ∏ÏßÄ ÏãùÎ¨ºÏõê)","description":"Located within Jungmun Resort, Yeomiji Botanical Garden is one of the best botanical gardens in Asia with a unique southern atmosphere.
