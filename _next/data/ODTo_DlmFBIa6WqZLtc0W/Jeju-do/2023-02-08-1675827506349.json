For geologists, this cave is invaluable since it demonstrates how lava continuously flowed over the surface of the ground and the complex route it took to eventually form a tube deep underground. Created particularly close to the earth‚Äôs surface, this cave has a number of entrance holes to the tunnel. Inside, the complex structure of the cave unfolds in the form of double-tiered or triple-tiered rooms. A range of lava formations such as lava columns and lava bridges have developed inside this mystical tube. <br><br>* The UNESCO World Heritage designated Geomunoreum Lava Tube System of Bengdwigul, Manjanggul Cave, Gimnyeonggul, Yongcheondonggul and Dangcheomuldonggul Caves.","regDate":"2023-02-15","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-15-1676439364074"},{"id":"2023-02-15-1676435981715","title":"Yongyeon Pond (Ïö©Ïó∞)","description":"Famous for its beautiful nightscape, Yongyeon Pond was formed by fresh water collecting at the end of a mountain valley before meeting the salty sea water. The pond is so deep that the bottom cannot be seen. The wooden Yongyeon Cloud Bridge crossing the pond and the pavilion are in harmony with the valley landscape. Legend has it that the pond was created by the water raining down off of a dragon that ascended to heaven. The name, meaning Dragon Pond, also comes from the belief that the dragon of Yongduam (Dragon Head Rock) just 200 meters to the west would come to this pond to play.","regDate":"2023-02-15","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-15-1676435981715/197824_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-15-1676435981715"},{"id":"2023-02-15-1676432370970","title":"Yongmeori Beach (Ïö©Î®∏Î¶¨Ìï¥Ïïà)","description":"Yongmeori Beach is where Sanbangsan Mountain stretches into the ocean and it looks as if a dragon‚Äôs head is going underwater.

There are many legends surrounding the rock. One legend has it that a dragon stealing precious jade from Hallasan Mountain was shot down by an arrow from the mountain deity. When he fell down, his body immediately sank into the ocean and his head rapidly froze looking at the sky. Another legend has it that a white horse, who dreamed of being a dragon and ascending to the sky, came to be caught by a soldier and froze into the rock.<br><br>From Yongduam Rock, visitors can see haenyeo (female divers) working at catching seafood. Near the rock are various cafes, bars, and restaurants. The coastal road between here and Aewol-eup is popular among couples.

Yeongsil Trail is known as the best autumn foliage course on Hallasan Mountain. Yeongsil Course is 3.7 kilometers and takes approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes. It starts from Yeongsil Rest Area and follows a relatively gentle slope lined with beautiful trees and autumn foliage for about one kilometer.<br> After that, an uphill path emerges along steep mountain ridges. The deep Yeongsilgyegok Valley and vast rock walls could be the result of a large volcano entrance in the past. After passing Byeongpungbawi Rock, the path becomes relatively flat until Witsaeoruem Rest Area. The first attraction of Yeongsil is a group of volcanic rocks collectively called Yeongsilgiam. These oddly shaped rocks are situated to the right of a big valley at 1,400 meters to 1,600 meters above sea level, soaring upwards towards the sky.
