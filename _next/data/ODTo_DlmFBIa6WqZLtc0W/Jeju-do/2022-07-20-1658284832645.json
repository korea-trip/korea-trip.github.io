Created particularly close to the earth’s surface, this cave has a number of entrance holes to the tunnel. Inside, the complex structure of the cave unfolds in the form of double-tiered or triple-tiered rooms. A range of lava formations such as lava columns and lava bridges have developed inside this mystical tube. <br><br>* The UNESCO World Heritage designated Geomunoreum Lava Tube System of Bengdwigul, Manjanggul Cave, Gimnyeonggul, Yongcheondonggul and Dangcheomuldonggul Caves.","regDate":"2023-02-15","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-15-1676439364074"},{"id":"2023-02-15-1676435981715","title":"Yongyeon Pond (용연)","description":"Famous for its beautiful nightscape, Yongyeon Pond was formed by fresh water collecting at the end of a mountain valley before meeting the salty sea water.

The deep Yeongsilgyegok Valley and vast rock walls could be the result of a large volcano entrance in the past. After passing Byeongpungbawi Rock, the path becomes relatively flat until Witsaeoruem Rest Area. The first attraction of Yeongsil is a group of volcanic rocks collectively called Yeongsilgiam. These oddly shaped rocks are situated to the right of a big valley at 1,400 meters to 1,600 meters above sea level, soaring upwards towards the sky.
