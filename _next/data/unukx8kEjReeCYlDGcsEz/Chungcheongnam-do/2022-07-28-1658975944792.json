The peninsula connected to Nammyeon was isolated during the Joseon Dynasty by cutting off access between Changgi-ri in Anmyeon-eup and Shinon-ri in Nammyeon for the convenience of tax transportation. The island's coast is lined with some 14 beaches as well as abundant pine trees, which are symbols of Anmyeon-eup. The island also owns Anmyeondo Natural Forest, along with the Mogamju Forest (Natural Monument No. 138).\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-41-673-3081|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-28-1658975944792/1894300_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1658975944792/1894300_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1658975944792/2426560_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1658975944792/2426560_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1658975944792/2426561_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1658975944792/2426561_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1658975944792/2426564_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1658975944792/2426564_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1658975944792/2426570_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1658975944792/2426570_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-41-673-3081](tel:+82416733081)\n- [🏠taean.go.kr](http://taean.go.kr/tour.do)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.5205057910\nlongitude: 126.3445458886\ntitle: 149, Jangteo-ro, Taean-gun, Chungcheongnam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>\nFrom Seoul Central City Terminal, take an intercity bus to Anmyeondo Island.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-28-1658975944792","title":"Anmyeondo Island (안면도)","description":"Located 30 km away from Taean, Anmyeondo Island is the sixth largest island in Korea, where a 200-meter bridge constructed in 1970 connects the island with Taean-gun.
