Hanok houses are generally divided into two sections, <em>anchae</em> and <em>sarangchae</em>. Sarangchae is where the men dwell. Because men and women had to remain separated, anchae is situated deep inside the house so that it is secretive and quiet. <br /><br />Another trait of hanok is that all the houses are heated with ondol, a unique floor heating system.
