She was perhaps the most tragic royal woman of the Joseon dynasty.<br><br>\nIn 1453, she was selected to be queen out of many candidates and actually became the queen a year later. However, when King Danjong was forced to abdicate from the throne and was exiled to Yeongwol in Gangwon-do, Queen Jeongsun was deprived of her title as well. <br><br>\nAfter King Danjong died, she built a thatched-roof house outside Seoul‚Äôs Dongdaemun Gate and lived there for the rest of her life, continuing to mourn her husband. The tomb‚Äôs name, Sareung, came from the fact that she had missed her dead husband so much. <br><br>\nUnlike other royal tombs, Sareung looks very simple. Its size is relatively small.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-31-573-8124|\n|parking:|Not available|\n|restdate:|Mondays|\n|usetime:|February-May & September-November 09:00-18:00 <br>June-August 09:00-18:30 <br>November-January 09:00-17:30 * Last ticketing one hour before closing|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals: Adults 1,000 won / Children 500 won<BR>Groups: Adults 800 won / Children 400 won<BR><BR>* Adults (ages 19-64) / Children (ages 7-18)<BR>* Groups: 10 people or more<br>* Free admission: Preschoolers (age 6 & younger), senior citizens (age 65 & older), on culture day (last Wednesday of the month) <BR><BR>* Additional ticket package: Time package (1 year / 12:00-13:00 / 30,000 won), Lunch time package (10 times / 12:00-14:00 / 3,000 won), 1 month package (10,000 won)|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-09-01-1662029028077/2480838_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-01-1662029028077/2480838_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-01-1662029028077/2480839_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-01-1662029028077/2480839_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-01-1662029028077/2480840_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-01-1662029028077/2480840_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-01-1662029028077/2480841_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-01-1662029028077/2480841_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-01-1662029028077/2480843_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-01-1662029028077/2480843_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-01-1662029028077/2480845_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-01-1662029028077/2480845_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-01-1662029028077/2480847_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-01-1662029028077/2480847_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-01-1662029028077/2480854_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-01-1662029028077/2480854_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-01-1662029028077/2480856_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-01-1662029028077/2480856_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-01-1662029028077/2480818_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-01-1662029028077/2480818_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-31-573-8124](tel:+82315738124)\n- [üè†royaltombs.cha.go.kr](http://royaltombs.cha.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.6457823166\nlongitude: 127.1973099372\ntitle: 180, Sareung-ro, Namyangju-si, Gyeonggi-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-09-01-1662029028077","title":"Namyangju Sareung Royal Tomb [UNESCO World Heritage] (ÎÇ®ÏñëÏ£º ÏÇ¨Î¶â(Ï†ïÏàúÏôïÌõÑ) [Ïú†ÎÑ§Ïä§ÏΩî ÏÑ∏Í≥ÑÎ¨∏ÌôîÏú†ÏÇ∞])","description":"Sareung Royal Tomb is the tomb of Queen Jeongsun (1440-1521), a consort to King Danjong.
