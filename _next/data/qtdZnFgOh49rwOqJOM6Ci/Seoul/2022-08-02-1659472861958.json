{"pageProps":{"content":"![Hwangudan Altar (ÌôòÍµ¨Îã®)](/2022-08-02-1659472861958/1946566_image2_1.webp)\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> Hwangudan Altar, also called Hwandan Altar, refers to an altar complex for the rite of heaven. The rites were first performed in the Goryeo dynasty by King Seongjong in the first month of 983 (2nd year of his reign), but was repeatedly adopted and abolished, and eventually stopped at the start of the Joseon dynasty. <br><br>Then in 1456 (2nd year of King Sejo), the practice was temporarily standardized and the rites were performed at Hwangudan Altar again in 1457. However, rites were again abolished in 1464 (10th year of King Sejo). It wasn‚Äôt until 1897 (34th year of King Gojong) when the Joseon dynasty was renamed as the Korean Empire and King Gojong ascended to emperor, that the rite was revived. \n<br><br>\nNow, Hwangungu Shrine and three stone drums stand at the location of the former altar complex. The three stone drums symbolize the instruments used for the rites. The shrine was completed in 1899, two years after the altar was started in 1897. Today, the Hwangungu Shrine still stands within the hotel grounds of the Westin Chosun Hotel.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-2-3396-5842|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-02-1659472861958/1570572_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659472861958/1570572_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659472861958/1570573_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659472861958/1570573_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659472861958/1570574_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659472861958/1570574_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659472861958/1570575_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659472861958/1570575_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659472861958/1570576_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659472861958/1570576_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-2-3396-5842](tel:+82233965842)\n- [üè†www.junggu.seoul.kr/tour</a> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br><a href=\" http://www.cha.go.kr\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"web\">www.cha.go.kr](http://www.junggu.seoul.kr/tour)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5651627568\nlongitude: 126.9794848592\ntitle: 112, Sogong-ro, Jung-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway]<br>\nFrom City Hall Station (Seoul Subway Line 1 & 2), Exit 5.<br>\nWalk straight and cross the road at the intersection.<br>\nCross the street on the right.<br>\nThe entrance to Hwangudan Altar is on the left.\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-02-1659472861958","title":"Hwangudan Altar (ÌôòÍµ¨Îã®)","description":"Hwangudan Altar, also called Hwandan Altar, refers to an altar complex for the rite of heaven.

The park is also important for being the starting point for the March 1 Independence Movement in Seoul. The original name of the park was Pagoda Park, but was changed to the current Tapgol Park on May 28, 1992. The park contains several monuments and heritages, including the Ten-story Stone Pagoda of Wongaksa Temple Site (National Treasure), Stele for the Construction of Daewongaksa Temple at Wongaksa Temple Site (Treasure), and Palgakjeong Pavilion, where the Independence Proclamation was first declared; the independence movement relief plate; and the statue of Son Byeong-hee.","regDate":"2022-08-10","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-10-1660114076645/2601459_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-08-10-1660114076645"},{"id":"2022-08-10-1660109832357","title":"Taereung and Gangneung Royal Tombs [UNESCO World Heritage] (ÏÑúÏö∏ ÌÉúÎ¶âÍ≥º Í∞ïÎ¶â [Ïú†ÎÑ§Ïä§ÏΩî ÏÑ∏Í≥ÑÎ¨∏ÌôîÏú†ÏÇ∞])","description":"Designated as a Historic Site, Taereung & Gangneung Royal Tombs is comprised of two tombs.
