The park is also important for being the starting point for the March 1 Independence Movement in Seoul. The original name of the park was Pagoda Park, but was changed to the current Tapgol Park on May 28, 1992. The park contains several monuments and heritages, including the Ten-story Stone Pagoda of Wongaksa Temple Site (National Treasure), Stele for the Construction of Daewongaksa Temple at Wongaksa Temple Site (Treasure), and Palgakjeong Pavilion, where the Independence Proclamation was first declared; the independence movement relief plate; and the statue of Son Byeong-hee.","regDate":"2022-08-10","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-10-1660114076645/2601459_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-08-10-1660114076645"},{"id":"2022-08-10-1660109832357","title":"Taereung and Gangneung Royal Tombs [UNESCO World Heritage] (ÏÑúÏö∏ ÌÉúÎ¶âÍ≥º Í∞ïÎ¶â [Ïú†ÎÑ§Ïä§ÏΩî ÏÑ∏Í≥ÑÎ¨∏ÌôîÏú†ÏÇ∞])","description":"Designated as a Historic Site, Taereung & Gangneung Royal Tombs is comprised of two tombs.
