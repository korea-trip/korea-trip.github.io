It was extremely difficult for outsiders to visit the academy until 1997, when a special tourism course was created. The course showcases the major sites at Korea Military Academy. Starting from the school information center, visitors can see the museum, memorial hall, and exhibition center in a 1.5 hour course. The Military Museum displays treasures and materials from each branch of the military, while visitors can see the history of the military and lifestyle of cadets at the memorial hall. However, the highlight of a trip to Korea Military Academy is watching the Hwarang Ceremony, a parade of cadets which takes place every Saturday at 11:30. In the ceremony, cadets don their formal uniform to march. Touring the academy at 10 is perfect for watching the parade later.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-2-2197-6125|\n|parking:|Available (Located behind Administrative Information Office at Gate 2)|\n|restdate:|Mondays, Weekends, January 1, Seollal (Lunar New Year) & Chuseok (Korean Thanksgiving) holidays|\n|usetime:|14:00-16:00 (Reservations required)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Tour Course Information:|Museum (Watch a movie about the school) ‚Üí Cheongheondang ‚Üí Hwarang training ground ‚Üí Outdoor weapons exhibition hall ‚Üí Memorial hall ‚Üí Cadet lifestyle hall ‚Üí Gate 2|\n|Available Facilities:|Educational facilities, living facilities, recreational facilities, memorial facilities|\n|Admission Fees:|Free (Admission restricted to visitors with advanced reservation; cars prohibited)|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Reservation Info. for Natives:|Reservation period: 3 months to 1 week in advance.<br />Reservation submission: Official website or official document (Reservations via phone not accepted) <br />* Korea Military Academy is an educational institution for cadets in the ROK Military and is therefore a military facility.

The park is also important for being the starting point for the March 1 Independence Movement in Seoul. The original name of the park was Pagoda Park, but was changed to the current Tapgol Park on May 28, 1992. The park contains several monuments and heritages, including the Ten-story Stone Pagoda of Wongaksa Temple Site (National Treasure), Stele for the Construction of Daewongaksa Temple at Wongaksa Temple Site (Treasure), and Palgakjeong Pavilion, where the Independence Proclamation was first declared; the independence movement relief plate; and the statue of Son Byeong-hee.","regDate":"2022-08-10","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-10-1660114076645/2601459_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-08-10-1660114076645"},{"id":"2022-08-10-1660109832357","title":"Taereung and Gangneung Royal Tombs [UNESCO World Heritage] (ÏÑúÏö∏ ÌÉúÎ¶âÍ≥º Í∞ïÎ¶â [Ïú†ÎÑ§Ïä§ÏΩî ÏÑ∏Í≥ÑÎ¨∏ÌôîÏú†ÏÇ∞])","description":"Designated as a Historic Site, Taereung & Gangneung Royal Tombs is comprised of two tombs.
