There is one main road in Insa-dong with alleys on each side. Within these alleys are galleries, traditional restaurants, teahouses, and cafes. <br>\n<br>\nThe galleries are the heartbeat of Insa-dong. There are about 100 galleries in the area offering every example of traditional Korean fine art from paintings to sculptures. The most famous galleries are Hakgojae Gallery, which functions as the center of folk art, Gana Art Gallery, which promotes many promising artists, and Gana Art Center. <br>\n<br>\nThe teahouses and restaurants are the perfect complement to the galleries. They are hidden deep within the twisting alleyways, making it feel like a treasure hunt. The shops in Insa-dong are very popular among all age groups, because each one is unique. <br>\n<br>\n Every Saturday from 14:00 to 22:00 and Sunday from 10:00 to 22:00, the main street is blocked to vehicular traffic and it becomes a cultural space. Stores set up booths outside and Korean candy merchants and fortune teller stalls can easily be found; there are traditional performances and exhibits as well. Insa-dong is especially popular among international tourists. This is where they can experience and see traditional Korean culture first-hand, and also purchase pieces of fine art.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-2-734-0222|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Outdoor stage (Naminsa Madang), souvenir shops, restaurants, craft shop, etc.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-04-1659591873426/1569277_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659591873426/1569277_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659591873426/1569278_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659591873426/1569278_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659591873426/1569279_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659591873426/1569279_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659591873426/1999119_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659591873426/1999119_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659591873426/1999121_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659591873426/1999121_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659591873426/2363661_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659591873426/2363661_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659591873426/2612525_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659591873426/2612525_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659591873426/2612528_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659591873426/2612528_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659591873426/2612531_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659591873426/2612531_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659591873426/1569276_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659591873426/1569276_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-2-734-0222](tel:+8227340222)\n- [üè†www.insainfo.or.kr](http://www.insainfo.or.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5754310780\nlongitude: 126.9833758804\ntitle: 62, Insadong-gil, Jongno-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway]<br>\nAnguk Station (Seoul  Subway Line 3),  Exit 6.<br>\nGo 100 m straight, then turn left.<br>\n <br>\nJonggak Station (Seoul Subway Line 1), Exit 3.<br>\nGo straight 300 m, and turn left at the 4-way Intersection.<br>\nGo straight 100 m, and take the left road toward Insadong-gil Road.<br>\n <br>\n[Bus]<br>\nGet off at Anguk Station, Jongno Police Office, or Insa-dong Bus Stop.<br>\nGreen Bus: 7025<br>\nBlue Bus: 109, 151, 162, 171, 172, 601<br>\nMaeul Bus: Jongno02<br>\nAirport Bus: 6011\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-04-1659591873426","title":"Insa-dong (Ïù∏ÏÇ¨Îèô)","description":"Insa-dong, located in the heart of the city, is an important place where old but precious traditional goods are on display.
