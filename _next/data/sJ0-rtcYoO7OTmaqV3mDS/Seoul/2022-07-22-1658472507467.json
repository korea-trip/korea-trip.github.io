It wasn't until 1593 that the palace was used as a temporary palace of the royal family after their home was burned down during the Imjin War. King Seonjo also stayed at Deoksugung Palace after returning to the city. It became a proper palace when Gwanghaegun (1575-1641) ascended to the throne and gave this royal residence the name Gyeongungung Palace in 1611. Over the following decades, the palace alternated between being an official palace and a temporary residence. The name did not change officially to Deoksugung Palace, meaning the ‚Äúpalace of virtuous longevity,‚Äù until 1907. While the palace once encompassed a vast area with many buildings, the current palace grounds are just a small shadow of the prior splendor, with very few structures remaining.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-2-771-9951,<br>+82-2-751-0734, +82-2-751-0753|\n|parking:|Not available|\n|restdate:|Mondays|\n|usetime:|09:00-21:00 <BR>* Last admission 1 hour before closing|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|[Foreign Visitors]<br>Individuals - Adults 1,000 won / Children 500 won<br>Groups - Adults 800 won / Children 400 won<br><br>* Adults (ages 19-64) / Children (ages 7-18)<br>* Group: 10 people or more<br>* Free admission: Preschoolers (ages 6 & younger), senior citizens (ages 65 & older), visitors wearing hanbok, all visitors on the last Wednesday of each month (Culture Day) <br><br>[Combination Ticket for Palaces]<br>- Sites: Changdeokgung Palace, Changgyeonggung Palace, Deoksugung Palace, Gyeongbokgung Palace, Jongmyo Shrine <br>- Fee: 10,000 won (Note, refund not available after using the ticket the first time)<br>- Validity: Up to one month after purchase.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1569114_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1569114_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1569115_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1569115_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1569116_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1569116_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1956603_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1956603_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1956605_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1956605_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1956608_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1956608_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1956609_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1956609_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1956612_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1956612_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1956615_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1956615_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1956617_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1956617_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-2-771-9951](tel:+8227719951)\n- [üè†www.deoksugung.go.kr](http://www.deoksugung.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5661486714\nlongitude: 126.9749296905\ntitle: 99, Sejong-daero, Jung-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-22-1658472507467","title":"Deoksugung Palace (ÎçïÏàòÍ∂Å)","description":"Registered as Historic Site No. 124, Deoksugung Palace was initially not a royal palace, but a residential home of Grand Prince Wolsan (1454-1488), the older brother of King Seongjong (1469-1494) of the Joseon dynasty.
