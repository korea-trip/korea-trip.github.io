The compound is composed of various buildings in addition to the main hall. The shrine was built at the same time as Gyeongbokgung Palace, under the orders of King Taejo, the first king of the Joseon dynasty. The shrine is the site of the royal memorial service, called Jongmyo Jaerye, a national event that has been passed down since the Three Kingdoms period. The shrine was designated as a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage site on December 9, 1995, for its well-preserved ancient customs, such as memorial services and traditional music, which are designated National Intangible Cultural Asset No. 1 & 56 respectively. <br><br>\n\nDuring the Joseon dynasty, the ritual was held on the first month of a seasonal change and the twelfth month of the lunar year, but was stopped during the Japanese colonial period. Now, it is annually reenacted on the first Sunday of May. Jongmyo Jaeryeak, the musical part of the ceremony, is produced by instruments, songs, and dances that originated over 500 years ago.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-2-765-0195,<br>+82-2-2174-3636|\n|parking:|Not available (Use paid parking lot of park in front of shrine)|\n|restdate:|Tuesdays|\n|usetime:|[Guided Tours] Hours vary by offered language<br> [General Viewing] Saturdays & last Wednesday of each month<br> February-May, September-October 09:00-18:00<br>June-August 09:00-18:30<br>November-January 09:00-17:30<br>* Last admission 1 hour before closing|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Tour Course Information:|[Course 1] (for 200 people or less)<br>Main gate - King Gongmin Shrine - Mangmyoru Pavilion - Hyangdaecheong - Jaegung Palace - Jeongjeon Hall - Yeongnyeongjeon Hall - Akgongcheong - Main gate<br><br>[Course 2] (for more than 200 people)<br>Main gate - Jaegung Palace - Jeongjeon Hall - Yeongnyeongjeon Hall - Akgongcheong - Hyangdaecheong - Mangmyoru Pavilion - King Gongmin Shrine - Main gate|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 1,000  won / Children 500 won<br> <br>* Adults (ages 19-64) / Children (ages 7-18)* Free admission (ID required): Preschoolers (ages 6 & younger), senior citizens (ages 65 & older), visitors wearing hanbok|\n|Available Facilities:|Benches, public telephone, wheelchair & stroller rental|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|[Guided Tours]<br><br> * English - 10:00, 12:00, 14:00, 16:00<br> * Japanese - 09:00, 09:40, 10:40, 11:40, 12:40, 13:40, 14:40, 15:40, 16:40 (Mar-Sep)<br> * Chinese - 11:00, 13:00, 15:00<br> <br><strong> </strong>* Reservation required via official website, except for Saturdays; up to 300 people per session<br>* Korean nationals may join a foreign language guided tour when accompanying international visitors.<br>* Guided tour in Japanese 16:40 session is only offered from March to September|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-04-1659641589916/1568476_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659641589916/1568476_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659641589916/1568478_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659641589916/1568478_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659641589916/2595051_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659641589916/2595051_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659641589916/2595053_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659641589916/2595053_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659641589916/2616918_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659641589916/2616918_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659641589916/2616919_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659641589916/2616919_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-2-765-0195](tel:+8227650195)\n- [üè†tour.jongno.go.kr</a> <br><a href=\"http://jm.cha.go.kr\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"web\">www.cha.go.kr](http://tour.jongno.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5731898785\nlongitude: 126.9948998937\ntitle: 157, Jong-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway]<br>\nJongno 3(sam)-ga Station (Seoul Subway Line 1, 3, 5), Exit 11.<br>\n <br>\n[Bus]<br>\nTake Bus No. 111, 201, 260, 262, 270, 271, 721, N15, N62 or 9301 and get off at Jongno 4(sa)-ga.Jongmyo Shrine Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-04-1659641589916","title":"Jongmyo Shrine [UNESCO World Heritage] (Ï¢ÖÎ¨ò [Ïú†ÎÑ§Ïä§ÏΩî ÏÑ∏Í≥ÑÎ¨∏ÌôîÏú†ÏÇ∞])","description":"Jongmyo Shrine was the primary place of worship for kings and their queens throughout the Joseon dynasty.
