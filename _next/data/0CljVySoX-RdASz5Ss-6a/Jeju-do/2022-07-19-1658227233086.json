The first waterfall falls into a pond with a depth of 21 meters. From here, it falls two more times, creating the second and third waterfalls, which then flow into the sea. To the east of the first waterfall is a cave, where water falls from the ceiling. In the past, people believed this water had healing properties, with many people bathing in the waters. These days, swimming is strictly prohibited. In Cheonjeyeon Valley, visitors can see Seonimgyo Bridge (arch bridge with 7 nymphs carved on the side) and the octagonal Cheonjeru Pavilion. Seonimgyo Bridge is also called Chilseonyeogyo, meaning \"seven nymphs bridge,\" and it connects Cheonjeyeon Falls with Jungmum Tourist Complex. <br><br>\n\nOn the surface of Cheonjeru Pavilion, there is a painting that tells Cheonjeyeon‚Äôs legend of the seven nymphs and the mountain god.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-64-760-6331|\n|parking:|Available|\n|usetime:|09:00-19:00 <br> * Last ticketing 1 hr. before closing|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 2,500 won / Children 1,350 won <br>Groups - Adults 2,050 won / Children 850 won <br><br> * Free admission: Preschoolers (ages 6 & younger), senior citizens (ages 65 & older)<br> * Group: 10 or more people<br>* Adults (ages 25-64) / Children (ages 7-24)|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-19-1658227233086/2650702_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658227233086/2650702_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658227233086/2650703_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658227233086/2650703_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658227233086/2650705_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658227233086/2650705_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658227233086/2650706_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658227233086/2650706_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658227233086/2650707_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658227233086/2650707_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-64-760-6331](tel:+82647606331)\n- [üè†www.visitjeju.net](http://www.visitjeju.net/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.2526559999\nlongitude: 126.4184294967\ntitle: 132, Cheonjeyeon-ro, Seogwipo-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Jeju Airport, take Airport Limosine Bus 600 bound for Jungmun and get off at Yeomiji Botanical Garden Bus Stop.<br>Walk for approx. 5-10 min.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-19-1658227233086","title":"Cheonjeyeonpokpo Falls (Ï≤úÏ†úÏó∞Ìè≠Ìè¨)","description":"Cheonjeyeonpokpo Falls, named \"The Pond of God,\" consists of three sections.
