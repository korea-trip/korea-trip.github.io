{"pageProps":{"content":"![Mangyeongdae Pavilion (만경대)](/2022-10-05-1664950030242/555048_image2_1.webp)\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> Mangyeongdae Pavilion, located on the shore of the East Coast, one-kilometer east of Donghae City Hall, was built in 1613 while old Joseon was under the rule of King Gwanghaegun. However, the pavilion was destroyed by rainstorms and later rebuilt by the Samcheok Kim family some 60 years ago. While offering a spectacular view of sea to the east, the pavilion also offers a refreshing view of expansive pine forests to the north. If you look to the west, you will enjoy a magnificent view of Dutasan Mountain beyond the pavilion’s back lawn as well as the Jeoncheon Stream flowing into the East Sea alongside a steep cliff-wall. As only Jukseoru Pavilion of Samcheok matched its view, poets of former times are said to have frequented Mangyeongdae Pavilion.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-33-530-2800|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-10-05-1664950030242/555040_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-05-1664950030242/555040_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-05-1664950030242/555046_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-05-1664950030242/555046_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-05-1664950030242/555054_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-05-1664950030242/555054_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-05-1664950030242/555071_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-05-1664950030242/555071_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-05-1664950030242/555073_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-05-1664950030242/555073_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-33-530-2800](tel:+82335302800)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.4871761244\nlongitude: 129.1366227835\ntitle: Gongdan 4-ro, Donghae-si, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>\nFrom Donghae Express Bus Terminal or Intercity Bus Terminal, take Bus No. Samcheok 21-1, 21-2, 22, or 9 and get off at the Bukpyeong Police Station Bus Stop.<BR> Walk for approx. 20 min.\n","data":{"id":"2022-10-05-1664950030242","title":"Mangyeongdae Pavilion (만경대)","description":"Mangyeongdae Pavilion, located on the shore of the East Coast, one-kilometer east of Donghae City Hall, was built in 1613 while old Joseon was under the rule of King Gwanghaegun.

As the mountain (san) comprises three rocky peaks (samak), which are Yonghwabong (main peak, 654 m), Cheongunbong (546 m), and Deungseonbong (632 m), it was named Samaksan Mountain. Although it is not a high and majestic mountain, it is considered a mountain with splendid scenery. Samaksan Mountain embraces a fantastic gorge formed through quartzitic jointing and waterfalls. Waterfalls in different sizes, such as Deungseon Falls, Seunghak Falls, and Juryeom Falls, create the splendid landscape, and the top of the mountain commands a panoramic view of downtown Chuncheon along with Uiamho Lake and the Bukhangang River. As its name tells, Samaksan Mountain is known for its rugged and precipitous features (aksan meaning a rugged, rocky mountain). The main access road to the mountain starts from the Deungseon Falls’ ticket booth and the Uiam Ticket Booth, and the trail from Uiam covers a hard, rocky section. As Gangwon-do Monument No. 16, Samaksan Mountain also has various interesting attractions, including Sangwonsa Temple, Heungguksa Temple, and Samaksanseong Fortress.","regDate":"2022-10-09","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-09-1665298551313/1842025_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-09-1665298551313"},{"id":"2022-10-09-1665295006748","title":"Sacheon Beach (사천해변(사천해수욕장))","description":"Nestled between Gyeongpodae Beach and Yeongok Beach, Sacheon Beach is a clean and quiet beach covering an area of 18,000 ㎡ over a length of 300 meters.
