It was built to satisfy the general public‚Äôs curiosity about the universe and celestial bodies, inspire young people, and give everyone a unique, memorable experience. The observatory is shaped like an egg, in memory of the legend of King Kim Suro, the founder of the Garak Kingdom, according to which the king was born from an egg. <Br><br>It is said that the queen of King Suro, Heo Hwang-ok, was a princess from the Indian country of Ayuta. Since sophisticated navigation equipment had yet to be invented, it can be assumed that she found her way to the Garak Kingdom by following the stars. It is also said that a prince of the Garak Kingdom built an observatory on the highest point of a mud fortress in Jinrye in order to make astronomical observations. The place is still referred to as Bibidan, which means a place to watch the stars. <Br><br>These historical facts indicate the stars were very important to the Gaya, an ancient kingdom established mainly in the Gimhae area. The peak of Bunseongsan Mountain, where the observatory is located, offers sweeping views of the entire area of Gimhae. The night sky of Gimhae offers a breathtaking sight.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-55-337-3785|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|Mondays (or the following day, if Monday is a holiday), New Year's Day|\n|usetime:|14:00-22:00 (Last admission is 30 minutes before closing)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Available Facilities:|[Exhibition Building] <br>Exhibition hall, planetarium, administrative office<br><br>[Observatory Building]<br> Observation room 1 & 2, subsidiary observation room|\n|Reservation Info. for Natives:|Online reservation (same-day reservation not accepted).|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-17-1671251914413/750150_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-17-1671251914413/750150_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-17-1671251914413/750151_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-17-1671251914413/750151_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-17-1671251914413/1205299_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-17-1671251914413/1205299_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-17-1671251914413/1205311_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-17-1671251914413/1205311_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-17-1671251914413/1611268_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-17-1671251914413/1611268_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-17-1671251914413/1611269_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-17-1671251914413/1611269_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-17-1671251914413/2484610_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-17-1671251914413/2484610_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-17-1671251914413/2484617_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-17-1671251914413/2484617_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-17-1671251914413/2610446_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-17-1671251914413/2610446_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-17-1671251914413/2484616_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-17-1671251914413/2484616_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-55-337-3785](tel:+82553373785)\n- [üè†www.ghast.or.kr](http://www.ghast.or.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.2515367663\nlongitude: 128.8893150780\ntitle: 254, Gaya thema-gil, Gimhae-si, Gyeongsangnam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \nFrom Gimhae Intercity Bus Terminal, \ntake a taxi to Gimhae Astronomical Observatory parking lot.<br>Walk approx. 15-20 min to Gimhae Astronomical Observatory.\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-17-1671251914413","title":"Gimhae Astronomical Observatory (ÍπÄÌï¥Ï≤úÎ¨∏ÎåÄ)","description":"Gimhae Astronomical Observatory opened on February 1, 2002 as part of the Millennium Commemorative Project that started in December 1998.

The park is one of the largest film and television studio sets in Korea.<br><br>The theme park is located in Gahori, Yongju-myeon (Hapcheon) and covers an area of over 231,406.00„é°. It is divided into two main sets separately owned by the major broadcasting companies KBS and MBC. The section owned by KBS houses reproductions of Seoul landmarks such as Seoul Station, Chosun Governor-General Office, and the Bando Hotel, as they appeared from the 1930s to the 1960s. MBC‚Äôs set focuses mainly on reproductions of streets from Sogong-dong, Seoul from the 1970s and 80s. A walk around this major filming location will transport visitors back into the Seoul of yore, a Seoul vastly different from the one people know and love today.<br><br>After a set is used for a film or a soap opera, the City of Hapcheon remodels and displays it as a type of exhibit, chronicling the area‚Äôs anthropologic development. In the future, the city plans to expand exhibits to include a facility where visitors can view a collection of historic military pieces.<br>&nbsp;<br>","regDate":"2022-12-19","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Theme Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-19-1671435346356/1867863_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-19-1671435346356"},{"id":"2022-12-19-1671431982703","title":"Hapcheon Haeinsa Temple (Ìï¥Ïù∏ÏÇ¨ (Ìï©Ï≤ú))","description":"Haeinsa Temple is one of Koreas three largest temples, and was founded during the third year of King Ae-jangs reign (802) by two monks Suneung and Ijung.
