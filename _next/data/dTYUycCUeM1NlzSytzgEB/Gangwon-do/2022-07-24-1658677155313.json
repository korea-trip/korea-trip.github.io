Photos of the family on vacation there show Kim Jungil as a young boy of six years. The building was constructed entirely of stone in 1938 by a German architect for the Sherwood Hall missionary family, and features a basement level and two above-ground floors. The house is now open to the public, with an exhibition of how the house was used by the Kim family, faithfully recreated from photographic research.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-33-680-3677|\n|opendate:|July 1999|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Summer 09:00-18:00 <br>Winter 09:00-17:30<br>* Last ticketing 1 hr before closing|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|[Hwajinpo History & Security Museum] <br />Individuals: Adults 3,000 won / Teenagers & Children 2,300 won <br />Groups: Adults 2,300 won / Teenagers & Children 1,600 won <br /><br>* Group: 30 people or more<br />* Admission includes Villa of Rhee Syngman, Villa of Lee Ki-poong, Castle of Hwajinpo & Ecology Museum <br />* Free admission: senior citizens (ages 65 and older)|\n|Restrooms:|Available at parking lot|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Available - English, Japanese, Chinese<br>* Advance reservation required at Hwajinpo Tourist Information Center|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-24-1658677155313/2600598_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658677155313/2600598_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658677155313/2600599_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658677155313/2600599_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658677155313/2600600_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658677155313/2600600_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658677155313/571638_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658677155313/571638_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658677155313/571640_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658677155313/571640_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658677155313/571641_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658677155313/571641_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-33-680-3677](tel:+82336803677)\n- [üè†www.gwgs.go.kr](https://www.gwgs.go.kr/tour/index.do)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 38.4725399459\nlongitude: 128.4431686945\ntitle: 280, Hwajinpo-gil, Goseong-gun, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus + Taxi]<br>\nFrom Dong Seoul Bus Terminal, take a bus to Ganseong Intercity Bus Terminal.<br>From Ganseong Bus Terminal, take a taxi for approx. 15 min.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-24-1658677155313","title":"Castle at Hwajinpo (ÌôîÏßÑÌè¨Ïùò ÏÑ±(ÍπÄÏùºÏÑ±Î≥ÑÏû•))","description":"The Castle of Hwajinpo was the summer retreat for Kim Ilsung, former leader of North Korea, and his family from 1948 to 1950.
