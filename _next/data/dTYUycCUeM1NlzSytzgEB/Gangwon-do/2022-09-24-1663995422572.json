Geumdanggyegok Valley is an impressive site with sections of both gentle and fast flowing valley waters. From late March through April full-blown azalea covers the mountainsides and valleys providing visitors with a refreshing spring scent.  <br><br>To reach Geumdanggyegok Valley, travel down along the Pyeongchanggang River from Jangpyeong or trek up the valley from Anmi Elementary School. Coming down to Pyeongchang-eup from Daehwa-myeon area, visitors will encounter an intersection called, ‚ÄúSaechugeori‚Äù.
