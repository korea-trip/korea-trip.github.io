The mountain is blessed with a 36-kilometer valley dotted with several scenic points, ponds, and waterfalls. <br><br>\nThe mountain contains prestigious cultural heritages, such as Jeoksangsanseong Fortress (Historic Site No. 146) and the Hanging Painting of Anguksa Temple (Treasure No. 1267) to name a few. It is also home to diverse wildlife animals and plants. The mountain's beauty can be enjoyed all year round, with royal azaleas in spring, a colony of daylilies in summer, colorful autumn foliage in fall, and a white snowy mountain vista in winter.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|expagerange:|Elementary to high school students|\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-63-322-3174|\n|parking:|Available <Br>- Samgong Parking Lot, Jeoksang Parking Lot, Pahoe Parking Lot|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Open 24 hr|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Natural Preservation Areas (closed to public):|National Park Protected Areas<br>* San-6 Gongjeong-ri, Anseong-myeon, Muju-gun (until 2026)<br>* San-109 Samgong-ri, Seolcheon-myeon, Muju-gun (whole area, until 2026)<br>* San-6 Gongjeong-ri, Anseong-myeon, Muju-gun (until 2028)<br>* San-1 Samgeo-ri, Mupung-myeon, Muju-gun (until 2029)<br>* San-109 Samgong-ri, Seolcheon-myeon, Muju-gun (whole area except trails, until 2031)<br>* San-282 Weolseong-ri, Buksang-myeon, Geochang-gun, Gyeongsangnam-do (until 2032)<br>* San-177 Jukcheon-ri, Anseong-myeon, Muju-gun (until 2032)<br>* San-1 Deoksan-ri, Anseong-myeon, Muju-gun (until 2033)|\n|Mountain Not Access Period:|Seasonal Forest Fire Watches<br>Spring: March 1 ‚Äì April 30<br>Fall: November 15 ‚Äì December 15<br>* To be decided by park directors based on fire weather advisories, snow/precipitation levels, and other local conditions.|\n|Available Facilities:|Park Visitor's Information Center, shelters, campsites, cabin and caravan accommodations|\n|Facility Utilization Fees:|Accommodations (Medium):  Low season 5,000 won / Peak season 7,000 won<br />Accommodations (Large): Low season 7,000 won / Peak season 9,000 won<br />Auto-camping site: Low season 15,000 won / Peak season 19,000 won|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Compact cars 2,000 won<BR>Small to Mid-sized cars: Low season 4,000 won / Peak season 5,000 won<BR>Large-sized cars: Low season 6,000 won / Peak season 7,500 won|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-31-1659278251086/1246526_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659278251086/1246526_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659278251086/1246534_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659278251086/1246534_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659278251086/1246538_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659278251086/1246538_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659278251086/1246552_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659278251086/1246552_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659278251086/1246555_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659278251086/1246555_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659278251086/1246573_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659278251086/1246573_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659278251086/1246578_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659278251086/1246578_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659278251086/1246593_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659278251086/1246593_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659278251086/1246603_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659278251086/1246603_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659278251086/1246632_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659278251086/1246632_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-63-322-3174](tel:+82633223174)\n- [üè†deogyu.knps.or.kr](http://deogyu.knps.or.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.9007210596\nlongitude: 127.7751204501\ntitle: 159, Gucheondong 1-ro, Muju-gun, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-31-1659278251086","title":"Deogyusan National Park (Main, Jeoksang Section) (ÎçïÏú†ÏÇ∞Íµ≠Î¶ΩÍ≥µÏõê (Î≥∏ÏÜå,Ï†ÅÏÉÅÎ∂ÑÏÜå))","description":"The area of Deogyusan National Park stretches out from the southern ridges of Sobaeksan Mountain, covering regions within four different counties in Gyeongsangnam-do and Jeollabuk-do.

According to the Samguk Sagi (history of the three kingdoms), Byeokgolje was first built in the 21st year of the reign of King Heulhae (AD 330) of the Silla Kingdom. However, this region belonged to the Baekje kingdom at that time, so some counter that the embankment was actually built in the 27th year of King Biryou (AD 330) of the Baekje kingdom. Historians agree, however, that the reservoir was mended by King Wonseong of Silla in AD 790 and by King Hyeonjong and King Injong of the Goryeo Dynasty in AD 1143. In 1415, King Taejong of the Joseon dynasty rebuilt the whole facility, but it was washed away in heavy rains five years later in the 2nd year of King Sejong.  <br><br>Only about three kilometers of the reservoir embankment remain intact today. Moreover, the original embankment underwent major transformations in 1925 when the Dongjin Land Improvement Association remolded it into a channel for carrying water to nearby fields. <br><br>In 1975, an archeological study of the sites where the two floodgates once stood revealed that highly refined measuring techniques had been used in the original construction of the reservoir. Thus, despite its many changes, Byeokgolje not only holds significance as Korea‚Äôs oldest manmade reservoir, but also as a historical relic that points to the highly developed engineering technology of the past.","regDate":"2022-08-01","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-01-1659337204897/1603977_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2022-08-01-1659337204897"},{"id":"2022-08-01-1659333898212","title":"Geumsansa Temple (Gimje) (Í∏àÏÇ∞ÏÇ¨(ÍπÄÏ†ú))","description":"Located near the entrance of the Moaksan Provincial Park, Geumsansa Temple was established in the first year of King Beop of the Baekje Kingdom (AD 599).

It is divided into small canyons and has an outstanding view with rocky mountains on all sides. The valley was called Gangcheon Valley because clean and clear water flows like a spring on the hard rocks, and all the mountains around it were called Gangcheonsan Mountain. It is said that in the past it was called Yongcheonsan Mountain, named after the shape of two dragons waving their tails toward the sky and ascending to heaven.<br><br>Following the Noryeong Mountain Range to Chuwolsan Mountain, it forms Gwangdeoksan Mountain and Yongcheonsan Mountain. On Sanseongsan Mountain (two dragons from the eastern sky to the western sky) that towers high in the sky, two dragons run east side by side. There are numerous peaks, some famous ones are, Yeondaebong, Undaebong, Suyeongbong, Cheonjabong, Gitdaebong, Gwangjubong, Gyeonjebong, and Songrakbong peaks. Between these two mountains is a very deep valley. Some of the famous valleys are, Yeondaegyegok Valley, Seonnyeogyegok Valley (Jeobujegol), Wondeunggyegok Valley (Yongdaeamgol), Buntonggol Pass, Jijigol Valley, Somokgol Valley, Samindaegyegok Valley (Hwangwoojegol), Giwoojegol Valley, Senyanggol Valley, Multonggol Valley, Chodanggol Valley, Ujakgol Valley, Dongmakgol Valley, Geumganggyegok Valley (Tapsanggol), Seungbanggol Valley, Byeondugol Valley, etc. The clear water flowing from every valley joins into one and the sound of the water crashing against the rocks and stones echoes throughout the valley and enters Gangcheonho Lake.<br><br>When spring comes, willows bloom, and when the forsythia and azaleas are in full bloom, wild cherry blossoms reach full bloom on every mountain peak. The clear and clean water flows continuously between the gravel along the valley. Visitors can cool off the heat in this river that does not collect moss either because it is too cold or clean. On Gangcheonsan Mountain, there are beautiful shrubs and maple trees, and the baby maples and baby squirrels announce the arrival of autumn among the seven different types of maple trees. The multiple trails on the mountain are not steep or too dangerous, making it popular regardless of age. It is also ideal for mountaineering and mountain-loving hikers. The scenery of the river with white snow and icicles attracts painters who want to capture the moment on a canvas. Gangcheonsan Mountain has four distinct seasons making it a popular destination all year round.","regDate":"2022-08-01","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Nature","Natural Sites","County Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-01-1659323323304/2634995_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2022-08-01-1659323323304"},{"id":"2022-07-31-1659310755947","title":"Gangam Calligraphy Museum (Í∞ïÏïîÏÑúÏòàÍ¥Ä)","description":"The Gangam Calligraphy Museum (est. 1995) in Jeonju Hanok Village has on display over 1,000 works from famous artists such as Kim Jeong-hee (1786-1856, calligrapher, painter, & scholar), Lee Sam-man (1770-1847, calligrapher), Kim Hong-do (1745-?, artist), and Jeong Yak-yong (1762-1836, scholar).
