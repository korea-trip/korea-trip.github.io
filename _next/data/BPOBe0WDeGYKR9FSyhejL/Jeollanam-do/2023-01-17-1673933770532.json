He was a scholar of the late Joseon dynasty and is noted for his great contributions to the development of practical learning in Korea.

Most of his famous books were written in Dasan Chodang. While walking along a road near Dasan Chodang, you can see the Cheonilgak pavilion, which offers a great view of beautiful Gangjin Bay.
