This pond was originally a reservoir made during the Japanese colonial period for irrigation, but was abandoned with the development of the Yeongsangang River system. The reservoir was recreated and expanded into todays lotus habitat thanks to the effort of Jeong Su-dong, who planted twelve lotus roots along the shoreline and took care of them dearly after dreaming of twelve white cranes landing upon the reservoir. The white lotus flowers in this pond blossom and fall from July until September. A lotus festival is held in August, when the flowers are at their peak.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-61-283-1325|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|[Blooming season] No closed dates<br> [Off season] Closed Mondays & public holidays|\n|usetime:|09:00‚Äì18:00<br> * Lotus blooming season: July 1 ‚Äì September 30|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Baengnyeon-ro, observatory deck, lawn plaza, theme park, bungalow, resting pavilion, drinking fountain, cafeteria, shade, acupressure trail, wild flower garden, etc.|\n|Admission Fees:|[Waterpark] <br>Individual: Adults 7,000 won / Teenagers & Children 6,000 won / Senior citizens & preschoolers 5,000 won<br>Group: Adults 6,000 won / Teenagers & Children 5,000 won / Senior citizens & preschoolers 4,000 won<br><br>* Children ages 3 & under - free of charge<br><br>[Camping fee]<br>Refer to the official website|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-26-1674722336812/1606959_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-26-1674722336812/1606959_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-26-1674722336812/1606961_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-26-1674722336812/1606961_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-26-1674722336812/1606963_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-26-1674722336812/1606963_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-26-1674722336812/1606964_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-26-1674722336812/1606964_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-26-1674722336812/2399159_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-26-1674722336812/2399159_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-26-1674722336812/2399160_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-26-1674722336812/2399160_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-26-1674722336812/2399164_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-26-1674722336812/2399164_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-26-1674722336812/2399166_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-26-1674722336812/2399166_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-26-1674722336812/2399170_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-26-1674722336812/2399170_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-26-1674722336812/1606960_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-26-1674722336812/1606960_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-61-283-1325](tel:+82612831325)\n- [üè†tour.muan.go.kr](http://tour.muan.go.kr/lotus)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 34.8601257396\nlongitude: 126.5299100793\ntitle: 333, Baengnyeon-ro, Muan-gun, Jeollanam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Seoul Central Bus Terminal, take an express bus to Muan Bus Terminal.<br>\nTake a taxi to Hoesan White Lotus Pond for approx. 40 min.\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-26-1674722336812","title":"Muan Hoesan White Lotus Pond (Î¨¥ÏïàÌöåÏÇ∞Î∞±Î†®ÏßÄ)","description":"Muan Hoesan White Lotus Pond is the largest habitat of white lotus in Asia, covering an area of approximately 330,000 square meters in Bogyong-ri, Muan-gun in Jeollanam-do.
