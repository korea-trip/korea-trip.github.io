It was built under the leadership of Japanese General Kato Kiyomasa  in \n1592-1593 at the beginning of the Imjinwaeran War (Japanese invasion, 1592-1598). The main fortress is located on a mountaintop 200 meters above \nsea level, a  second fortress is halfway down the mountain, and a  third fortress is \nlocated at the bottom of the mountain. The  whole fortress is rectangular shaped. The fortress wall is 6 meters high and slants at an angle of 15 degrees.<br> \n\n<br>In 1594, a Buddhist monk named&nbsp;Samyeong-daesa came to Seosaengpo Waeseong Fortress four times to negotiate for peace, but he failed each time. In 1598, the fortress was taken over \nby Korea with the assistance of General Magwi of the Ming dynasty. A year later, Changpyodang Shrine was built in honor of 53 Koreans \nwho died during battles against the Japanese invading forces. However, the shrine was destroyed during the Japanese imperialism period and no \ntrace of it remains. It is possible to tell from Seosaengpo Jinseongdo (a map drawn up in 1872) that the fortress was also partially used by  Korean forces.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-52-204-0324|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-19-1660914228428/530629_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-19-1660914228428/530629_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-19-1660914228428/530631_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-19-1660914228428/530631_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-52-204-0324](tel:+82522040324)\n- [🏠tour.ulju.ulsan.kr</a> (Korean only)<br><a href=\"http://www.cha.go.kr/\" target=\"_blank\">www.cha.go.kr](http://tour.ulju.ulsan.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.3832802498\nlongitude: 129.3343448775\ntitle: Seosaeng-ri, Seosaeng-myeon, Ulju-gun, Ulsan-si\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Seoul Express Terminal, take a bus to Ulsan Bus Terminal.<br> Across from Ulsan Express/Intercity Bus Terminal, take Bus No. 715 and get off at Seosaengpo \nJapanese Fortress Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-19-1660914228428","title":"Seosaengpo Waeseong Fortress (서생포왜성)","description":"Seosaengpo Waeseong Fortress (Seosaengpo Japanese Fortress) is a  stone fortress typical of the Japanese style popular in the later part of the 16th century.

Gajisan Mountain is the tallest of this group, rising above mountains almost 1,000 meters high. <br><br> An attraction of hiking in Gajisan Mountain is that various large, oddly shaped rock peaks can be seen from the mountain trail. To the east of the mountain is Seongnamsa Temple built during the Silla Kingdom. Today, only Buddhist nuns remain, but there are relics like the stupa of Seongnamsa Temple (Treasure) and a three-story stone pagoda.","regDate":"2022-08-21","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Ulsan","Nature","Natural Sites","Provincial Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-21-1661055031124/1144544_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Ulsan/2022-08-21-1661055031124"},{"id":"2022-08-21-1661046146964","title":"The Oriental Medicine Resort  Chorakdang (한방테마파크 초락당)","description":"Opened in 2001, Chorakdang is a health resort that specializes in Oriental medicine treatments.

Not just a symbol of pride for the people of Ulsan, the river has long since been a precious commodity that has played a pivotal role in Ulsan culture and history.

The river is presently an important source of drinking water for the citizens of Ulsan. <br><br> The field around the midpoint of Taehwagang River was left abandoned for a long time before it was founded as Taehwagang National Garden, preserving nature while providing a resting spot to the citizens of Ulsan. The garden is over twice the size of Yeouido Park in Seoul, and consists of natural water and a lush bamboo forest, known as Simnidae Forest, along with canola and forage barley fields. Simnidae Forest was once in danger of demolition as part of the government's flood control plans but remains preserved thanks to community efforts. Preservation efforts led to turning the area into Taehwagang National Garden of today, which took place from 2004 to 2010.","regDate":"2022-08-20","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Ulsan","Nature","Natural Sites","Eco-Tourism Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-20-1660977784342/2653664_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Ulsan/2022-08-20-1660977784342"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
