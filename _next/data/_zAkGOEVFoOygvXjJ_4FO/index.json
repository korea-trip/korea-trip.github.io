The path along the area’s thick forest and natural valleys provides an excellent getaway. Since the area is a habitat to several protected species, visitors are asked to refrain from dipping their feet in the valley’s waters while exploring the scenery. The entrance to the valley is located past the Sanmotungi Café.","regDate":"2022-07-11","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Nature","Natural Sites","Valleys"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-11-1657512722673/1926514_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-07-11-1657512722673"},{"id":"2022-07-11-1657507335227","title":"Baek In-je House (백인제가옥)","description":"Baek In-je House in Gahoe-dong, located in Bukchon Hanok Village, is a hanok built during the Japanese administration period that portrays modern hanok features. The structure consists of a main room offering a good view of the whole village, spacious bedrooms, a large garden, and annex buildings. As it withholds the beauty of a traditional hanok while incorporating the modern trend of its time, Baek In-je House is considered to be highly valuable in means of both architecture and history, representing the Bukchon Hanok Village together with Yun Bo-seon House.<br /><br />Baek In-je House was built from black pine, which was first introduced in Seoul during the Gyeongseong Expo in 1907, distinguishing itself from other upper-class houses of its time. Unlike other traditional hanok designs that separate the main building from the other rooms, Baek In-je House connects the two with a hallway, allowing convenient access between the two structures. The house also consists of a Japanese-style hallway and floor mat rooms, reflecting the interior trends of that period. Baek In-je House is also unique in that the main room is partially built as a two-story structure, a style that was never seen in any traditional hanok built during the Joseon period.","regDate":"2022-07-11","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Old Houses"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481892_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-07-11-1657507335227"},{"id":"2022-07-11-1657494251347","title":"Aqua Planet 63 (아쿠아플라넷 63)","description":"Aqua Planet 63 located in 63 Square was opened on July 1, 2016.
