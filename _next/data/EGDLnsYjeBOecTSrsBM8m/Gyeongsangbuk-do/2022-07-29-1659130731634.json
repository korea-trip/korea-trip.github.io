The forest is composed of 100-year-old white pine trees brimming with pine nuts, along with pines and larches. In the forest, you can see the trees standing tall amidst the majestic rock formations. If you walk along the mountain trail, you will come to a suspension bridge, and after crossing, you will enter a section of forest that has maintained an old, almost primeval, feeling.\n<br><br>\nIn spring, beautiful wild flowers blossom throughout the forest, magnolias in particular, bloom within the valley. Cheongoksan National Recreational Forest features a variety of facilities such as a nearby water park, children‚Äôs playground, fitness center, campsite and an outdoor lecture field. The water in the water park is cold and very clean, using natural stream water. In nearby Baekcheongyegok Valley, you may also see Manchurian trout, which live in clean, fresh water streams. Hyeonbulsa Temple is also located in the valley.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|accomcount:|1,000 people a day|\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-54-672-1051|\n|opendate:|August 7, 1991|\n|parking:|Available|\n|usetime:|[Accommodations] Check in 15:00 / Check out 12:00<br>[General park hours] 09:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 1,000 won / Children 600 won / Preschoolers 300 won<br>Groups - Adults 800 won / Children 500 won / Preschoolers 200 won<br><br>* Adults (ages 19-64) / Children (ages 7-18) / Preschoolers (ages 6 and younger)<br>* Groups: 20 people or more<br>* Free admission December-March|\n|Available Facilities:|Accommodations, training facilities, outdoor facilities, etc.|\n|Facility Utilization Fees:|Varies by facility; please make an inquiry in advance.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Light-weight vehicles 1,500 won / Small & mid-sized vehicles 3,000 won / Large vehicles 5,000 won|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999491_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999491_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999492_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999492_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999493_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999493_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999495_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999495_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999497_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999497_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999498_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999498_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999499_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999499_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999500_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999500_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999502_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999502_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999503_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999503_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-54-672-1051](tel:+82546721051)\n- [üè†www.huyang.go.kr](http://www.huyang.go.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.0391887631\nlongitude: 128.9956517691\ntitle: 1552-163, Cheongok-ro, Bonghwa-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Train]<br>\nTake a train from Cheongnyangni Station to Taebaek Station.<br><br>\n\n[Taxi]<br>\nApprox. 25 min from Taebaek Station.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-29-1659130731634","title":"Cheongoksan National Recreational Forest (Íµ≠Î¶Ω Ï≤≠Ïò•ÏÇ∞ÏûêÏó∞Ìú¥ÏñëÎ¶º)","description":"Cheongoksan National Recreational Forest is located in Bonghwa-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do.
