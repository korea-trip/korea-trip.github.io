It was rebuilt in the 13th year of King Hyeonjong’s reign (1672) after a fire destroyed the original temple complex during the Imjin War (1592-1598). During work to renovate Bogwangjeon Hall in 1976, a text that had been put up with the ridge beams was found. Bogwangjeon Hall is a small building and its ceiling is in the form of the sharp symbol (#). A Birojanabul Buddhist statue is enshrined in the hall.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-54-873-2908|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Sunrise - sunset|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|[Cultural Asset Admission]<br>Individuals - Adults 2,800 won / Teenagers 1,000 won / Children 600 won<br>Groups - Adults 2,500 won / Teenagers 700 won / Children 500 won<br><br>* Groups: 30 people or more|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-22-1669095495385/2702628_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-22-1669095495385/2702628_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-22-1669095495385/2702631_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-22-1669095495385/2702631_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-22-1669095495385/2702634_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-22-1669095495385/2702634_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-54-873-2908](tel:+82548732908)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.3968483197\nlongitude: 129.1460268692\ntitle: 226, Gongwon-gil, Cheongsong-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-22-1669095495385","title":"Daejeonsa Temple (대전사)","description":"Daejeonsa Temple is said to have been built by Great Monk Uisang in the 12th year of King Munmu’s reign (672).
