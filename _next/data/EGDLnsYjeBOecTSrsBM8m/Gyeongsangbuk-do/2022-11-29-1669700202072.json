King Naemul was known as the first king to initiate the king title of ‚ÄòMaripgan‚Äô and was known for spreading cultural advancements from China to the Korean people. When the allied forces of Baekje and Japan attacked, he asked Gwanggaeto the Great of Goguryeo for help and led the people to victory, contributing to the increased strength of the Silla Kingdom. After his rule, the throne was exclusively ceded to members of the Kim family clan.<br><br>The royal tomb of King Naemul is a large mound (22 m in diameter and 5.3 m in x_height) that sits on the northern hill of the Confucian school of Gyeongju. The edge of a natural stone is exposed around the bottom of the mound, pointing to the fact that the inner chamber tomb was made of stone. In the historical document Samguk Sagi (History of the Three Kingdoms), no records are found about the tomb, but the Samguk Yusa (Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms) describes the king‚Äôs tomb as being located in the southwest of Cheomseongdae, which is consistent with the tomb‚Äôs location.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-54-779-6100|\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-54-779-6100](tel:+82547796100)\n- [üè†www.gyeongju.go.kr/tour](http://www.gyeongju.go.kr/tour)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.8327108094\nlongitude: 129.2175479524\ntitle: Gyo-dong, Gyeongju-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>\nAcross from the Gyeongju Express Bus Terminal, take Bus No. 70 and get off at Cheomseongdae Bus Stop.<br>Walk for approx. 10 min.\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-29-1669700202072","title":"Gyeongju Royal Tomb of King Naemul (Í≤ΩÏ£º ÎÇ¥Î¨ºÏôïÎ¶â)","description":"King Naemul was the 17th monarch of the Silla Kingdom (in power from 356 to 402) and became the second king of the Kim family name.
