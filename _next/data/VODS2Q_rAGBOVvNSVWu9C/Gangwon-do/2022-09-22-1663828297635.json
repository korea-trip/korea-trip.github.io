When no one else was brave enough to find his body, Eom Heung-do, the governor of Yeongwol Lake, found his body and buried him in the tomb that later became Jangneung, one of the royal tombs of the Joseon dynasty. Danjong had been stripped of his title at the time he was exiled. His title was later restored in year 1698, during the reign of King Sukjong, and received his posthumous name Danjong, and thereafter was referred to as King Danjong. <br><br>Jangneung houses such buildings as Jeongjagak, Baesikdansa, Jaesil, Yeongcheon, and Hongsammun, and a history hall with relics of Danjong.
