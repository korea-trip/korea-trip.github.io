Well-known films and soap operas include Seoul 1945, Fighter in the Wind, Gyeongseong Scandals, Meeting Plaza, Dachimawa Lee, Modern Boy and East of Eden. The park is one of the largest film and television studio sets in Korea.<br><br>The theme park is located in Gahori, Yongju-myeon (Hapcheon) and covers an area of over 231,406.00„é°. It is divided into two main sets separately owned by the major broadcasting companies KBS and MBC. The section owned by KBS houses reproductions of Seoul landmarks such as Seoul Station, Chosun Governor-General Office, and the Bando Hotel, as they appeared from the 1930s to the 1960s. MBC‚Äôs set focuses mainly on reproductions of streets from Sogong-dong, Seoul from the 1970s and 80s. A walk around this major filming location will transport visitors back into the Seoul of yore, a Seoul vastly different from the one people know and love today.<br><br>After a set is used for a film or a soap opera, the City of Hapcheon remodels and displays it as a type of exhibit, chronicling the area‚Äôs anthropologic development. In the future, the city plans to expand exhibits to include a facility where visitors can view a collection of historic military pieces.<br>&nbsp;<br>\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-55-930-3752~5,<br>+82-55-930-3744,<br> +82-55-930-3743 (Nighttime)|\n|usetime:|9:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 5,000 won / Students & Children 3,000 won / Seniors (ages 65 or more) & People with disabilities (lvl. 4 or higher) 2,500 won<br>Groups - Adults 3,000 won / Students & Children 2,000 won / Seniors (ages 65 or more) & People with disabilities (lvl. 4 or higher) 1,500 won<br><br>* Free admission (proof required): People with disabilities (lvl. 1-3), Children (ages 6 or younger), etc.|\n|Available Facilities:|Filming set (40 sites), agricultural and specialty product sales market, restaurant, etc.|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-19-1671435346356/1867861_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-19-1671435346356/1867861_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-19-1671435346356/1867864_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-19-1671435346356/1867864_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-19-1671435346356/1867866_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-19-1671435346356/1867866_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-19-1671435346356/1867869_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-19-1671435346356/1867869_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-19-1671435346356/1867872_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-19-1671435346356/1867872_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-19-1671435346356/1867862_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-19-1671435346356/1867862_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-19-1671435346356/1867867_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-19-1671435346356/1867867_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-19-1671435346356/1867868_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-19-1671435346356/1867868_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-19-1671435346356/1867870_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-19-1671435346356/1867870_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-19-1671435346356/1867873_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-19-1671435346356/1867873_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-55-930-3752~5](tel:+82559303752~5)\n- [üè† theme.hc.go.kr](http://culture.hc.go.kr/contents/view_contents/contents_2_1)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.5491995167\nlongitude: 128.0713092811\ntitle: 757, Hapcheonhosu-ro, Yongju-myeon, Hapcheon-gun, Gyeongsangnam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \nFrom the \nSeoul Nambu Bus Terminal, take a bus towards Hapcheon<br>(5 buses daily at 10:08, \n12:00, 14:00, 15:00, 16:45.

From above, elegant curvilinear coastal lines are enveloped by lush trees of the forest, serving as a protection against the Namhae sea. Mulgeon-ri is divided into two areas  the port with a lighthouse, and farmlands, with the forest in between the two. From German Village in Namhae, scenic overlooks provide sweeping views of Mulgeon-ri, the forest, and the port.<br><br>The forest is called a variety of names; it is called Bangpungrim (Windbreak Forest) because it protects villages from gusty winds; Eoburim (Fish shelter Forest) because its lush trees attract schools of fish; and Bangjorim (Waterbreak Forest) because it lessens the severity of waves and tides.<br><br>Home to German Village, Mulgeon-ri faces eastward. Naturally, it is a great spot to see the sunrise and sunset. While Jeongdongjin is renowned for its splendid sunrise on the East Coast, Mulgeon-ri shares the acclaim on the South Coast, attracting thousands of visitors at the dawn of every New Year.","regDate":"2022-12-23","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Eco-Tourism Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-23-1671773763251/2652510_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-23-1671773763251"},{"id":"2022-12-23-1671770382256","title":"Mujidori Village (Muju Farm Village) (Î¨¥ÏßÄÎèåÏù¥ÎßàÏùÑ)","description":"Having a 500-year-old history, Mujidori Village is a traditional village with a small stream by the entrance, seven mountain peaks, and three reservoirs.
