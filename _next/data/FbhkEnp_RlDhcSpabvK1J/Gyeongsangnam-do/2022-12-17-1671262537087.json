The forest boasts over 100 different species of trees ‚Äî from hackberries to oaks, zelkovas, fringe trees, muku trees, and silver magnolias. All in all, 10,000 trees create the feeling of being in an ancient forest, deep in the mountains.<br><br>The forest was built by people in nearby villages 300 years ago in order to control winds and waves. From above, elegant curvilinear coastal lines are enveloped by lush trees of the forest, serving as a protection against the Namhae sea. Mulgeon-ri is divided into two areas  the port with a lighthouse, and farmlands, with the forest in between the two. From German Village in Namhae, scenic overlooks provide sweeping views of Mulgeon-ri, the forest, and the port.<br><br>The forest is called a variety of names; it is called Bangpungrim (Windbreak Forest) because it protects villages from gusty winds; Eoburim (Fish shelter Forest) because its lush trees attract schools of fish; and Bangjorim (Waterbreak Forest) because it lessens the severity of waves and tides.<br><br>Home to German Village, Mulgeon-ri faces eastward. Naturally, it is a great spot to see the sunrise and sunset. While Jeongdongjin is renowned for its splendid sunrise on the East Coast, Mulgeon-ri shares the acclaim on the South Coast, attracting thousands of visitors at the dawn of every New Year.","regDate":"2022-12-23","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Eco-Tourism Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-23-1671773763251/2652510_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-23-1671773763251"},{"id":"2022-12-23-1671770382256","title":"Mujidori Village (Muju Farm Village) (Î¨¥ÏßÄÎèåÏù¥ÎßàÏùÑ)","description":"Having a 500-year-old history, Mujidori Village is a traditional village with a small stream by the entrance, seven mountain peaks, and three reservoirs.
