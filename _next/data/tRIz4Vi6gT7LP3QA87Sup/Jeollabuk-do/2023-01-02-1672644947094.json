In 1404, a civil official from the Joseon dynasty built this structure as a country house.  Hanbyeokdang was built at the foot of Seungamsan Mountain with beautiful views of the Jeonjucheon River below.  A large highway has since been built nearby taking away from the natural beauty.  In the past, many writers often sought out Hanbyeokdang Pavilion to find inspiration in their writing.  The pavilion is well known for the beauty of the mountain mist flowing down the mountain, thus making it one of the 8 must sees in Jeonju.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info:+82-63-281-2166|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|24 hrs|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-02-1672644947094/167360_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-02-1672644947094/167360_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-02-1672644947094/2515271_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-02-1672644947094/2515271_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-02-1672644947094/2515272_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-02-1672644947094/2515272_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-02-1672644947094/2515273_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-02-1672644947094/2515273_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-02-1672644947094/2515275_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-02-1672644947094/2515275_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-02-1672644947094/2515300_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-02-1672644947094/2515300_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-02-1672644947094/2515301_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-02-1672644947094/2515301_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-02-1672644947094/2515302_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-02-1672644947094/2515302_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-02-1672644947094/2515450_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-02-1672644947094/2515450_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-63-281-2166](tel:+82632812166)\n- [üè†tour.jeonju.go.kr</a> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br><a href=\"http://www.cha.go.kr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"ÏÉàÏ∞Ω : Î¨∏ÌôîÏû¨Ï≤≠ ÌôàÌéòÏù¥ÏßÄÎ°ú Ïù¥Îèô\">www.cha.go.kr](http://tour.jeonju.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.8118786778\nlongitude: 127.1608384836\ntitle: 2, Girin-daero, Wansan-gu, Jeonju-si, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR> From Jeonju Express Bus Terminal Bus Stop, take Bus No. 211, 221, 231, 241, or 251 bound for Nambu Market and get off at Jeondong Cathedral Bus Stop.<BR> Walk for approx. 10-20 min.\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-02-1672644947094","title":"Hanbyeokdang Pavilion (ÌïúÎ≤ΩÎãπ)","description":"Located in Jeollabuk-do province, Hanbyeokdang Pavilion has been designated Tangible Cultural Property No. 15.
