Sin Jae-hyos House in Gochang was built in 1850, and visitors can observe sarangchae (main room), an old well, and a paulownia tree preserved to this day. Sin was not a singer himself but a pansori enthusiast, and he used wealth to train potential singers and contribute to the growth of pansori. He also compiled and edited six pansori madangs (operas) titled Ttoggi Taryeong, Bak Taryeong, Simcheongga, Jeokbyeokga, Chunhyangga, and Garujigi Taryeong, of which only five are passed down. To honor his contributions and passion for pansori, Dongni Gugakdang was founded behind this house.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-63-560-2943|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-09-1673246392392/1606378_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-09-1673246392392/1606378_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-09-1673246392392/1606379_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-09-1673246392392/1606379_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-09-1673246392392/1606380_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-09-1673246392392/1606380_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-09-1673246392392/1606381_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-09-1673246392392/1606381_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-09-1673246392392/1606382_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-09-1673246392392/1606382_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-09-1673246392392/1606383_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-09-1673246392392/1606383_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-63-560-2943](tel:+82635602943)\n- [üè†www.gochang.go.kr</a><br><a href=\"http://www.cha.go.kr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"new window popup\" class=\"web\">www.cha.go.kr](http://www.gochang.go.kr/culture)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.4322000769\nlongitude: 126.7030639278\ntitle: 100, Dongni-ro, Gochang-gun, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-09-1673246392392","title":"Sin Jae-hyo's House (Í≥†Ï∞Ω Ïã†Ïû¨Ìö® Í≥†ÌÉù)","description":"Sin Jae-hyo (1812-1884) was a legendary theorist, director, and sponsor of pansori (epic chant).
