Red pine trees salvaged from the demolition of Gyeongungung Palace were used to construct the house.

The shrine of the house that was destroyed in 1960 was also restored. <br>Because the house is more of a shrine rather than residential living quarters, it has many unique features.

The name later changed again to the current Gyeonghuigung Palace in 1760. The palace grounds included many halls but they were mostly all burned down in a fire in 1829. After the Japanese occupation began, all remaining buildings on the site were torn down and the palace grounds were turned into Gyeongseong Middle School (now Seoul High School). The school moved to Gangnam area in 1987, afterwhich the previous location was turned into a park.
