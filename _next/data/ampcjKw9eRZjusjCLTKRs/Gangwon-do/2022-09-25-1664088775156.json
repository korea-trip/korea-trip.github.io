{"pageProps":{"content":"![Gugokpokpo Falls (구곡폭포)](/2022-09-25-1664088775156/1583495_image2_1.webp)\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> Located at the foot of Bonghwasan Mountain in Chuncheon, Gugok Falls with a x_height of 50 m is one of the representative tourist destinations in the Gangchon area. It was named “Gugok” because the falls twist (gok) and turn nine (gu) different times before dropping down, and is also called “Guguripokpo.” Gugok Falls flowing down from a huge stone wall create fantastic scenery. Many tourists visit the falls every year to enjoy cool, refreshing water to overcome the heat wave in summer and to admire a majestic view of the giant ice wall in winter. The road from the ticket booth to the falls is gentle and requires about 20 min walk. It is an easy walking path surrounded by woods and the valley. Visitors can also try to find the nine wooden panels inspired by the spirit of Gugok and designed with Hangeul alphabet “ㄲ” letters (such as 꿈, 끼, 꾀, 깡, etc.). If you go up for about 40 min along the Kkalttak Pass, which is on the right side of the Gugok Falls entrance, you will find Munbae Village, nestled in a basin. The village restaurants are known for local dishes, such as wild vegetable bibimbap and folk liquor. Visitors can also stay overnight at the National Leisure Campground built in the Gukgok Falls Tourist Area.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-33-261-0088|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|Open year round|\n|usetime:|08:30–17:30(It is subject to the weather.)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|People aged 7 to 65: KRW 2,000, Persons of national merit, the elderly, preschoolers, PWD, and residents in the lake culture zone (Chuncheon, Yanggu, Hwacheon, Hongcheon, and Inje): Free of charge|\n|Parking Fees:|Subcompact vehicles: KRW 1,000, Small vehicles: KRW 2,000, Large vehicles: KRW 4,000|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-09-25-1664088775156/1583493_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664088775156/1583493_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664088775156/1780589_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664088775156/1780589_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664088775156/1780590_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664088775156/1780590_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-33-261-0088](tel:+82332610088)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.7939337577\nlongitude: 127.6092986794\ntitle: 254, Gangchongugok-gil, Namsan-myeon, Chuncheon-si, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Gangchon Station, take Bus No. 50 or 50-1 and get off at Gugokpokpo Falls Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-09-25-1664088775156","title":"Gugokpokpo Falls (구곡폭포)","description":"Located at the foot of Bonghwasan Mountain in Chuncheon, Gugok Falls with a x_height of 50 m is one of the representative tourist destinations in the Gangchon area.
