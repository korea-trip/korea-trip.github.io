Dosanseodang area consists of living quarters and lecture halls where Toegye Yi Hwang, an eminent Confucian scholar, lived and taught his students. Dosanseowon was built after Toegye Yi Hwang passed away by his followers in legacy of his teachings as well as to pay respects to the deceased. <br><br>Built in 1561, Dosanseodang lecture hall is the oldest building in the whole complex. It was personally designed by Yi Hwang, penname Toegye, to further his studies while educating future scholars after moving to the countryside. Living quarters used as a student dormitory were also built along with the lecture hall. <br><br>Dosanseowon compound was completed in 1576, six years after Yi Hwangs death. Yi Hwangs ancestral tablet was enshrined inside Sangdeoksa Shrine (Treasure No. 211) in 1572. Two years later, Jeongyodang Lecture Hall (Treasure No. 210) was built to relocate the tablet and with the addition of buildings to the halls east and west, the area became a seowon. In 1575, the establishment was bestowed a royal charter and a plaque with the name Dosanseowon written by Han Seok-bong, and became the Confucian academy headquarters in the Yeongnam region.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢For more info +82-54-840-6599|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Summer 09:00-18:00<br>Winter 09:00-17:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals ‚Äì Adults 1,500 won / Teenagers 700 won / Children 600 won<br> Groups ‚Äì Adults 1,300 won / Teenagers 600 won / Children 500 won<br><br>* Groups - 30 people or more<BR> * Adults (ages 20 and older)|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Available in English (advance inquiry required)|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-11-1670733665757/2620848_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-11-1670733665757/2620848_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-11-1670733665757/2620850_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-11-1670733665757/2620850_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-11-1670733665757/2620851_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-11-1670733665757/2620851_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-11-1670733665757/2620852_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-11-1670733665757/2620852_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-11-1670733665757/2635199_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-11-1670733665757/2635199_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-11-1670733665757/2635201_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-11-1670733665757/2635201_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-11-1670733665757/2622281_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-11-1670733665757/2622281_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-54-840-6599](tel:+82548406599)\n- [üè†www.dosanseowon.com](http://www.dosanseowon.com/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.7270437877\nlongitude: 128.8425024340\ntitle: 154, Dosanseowon-gil, Andong-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-11-1670733665757","title":"Dosanseowon Confucian Academy [UNESCO World Heritage] (ÎèÑÏÇ∞ÏÑúÏõê [Ïú†ÎÑ§Ïä§ÏΩî ÏÑ∏Í≥ÑÎ¨∏ÌôîÏú†ÏÇ∞])","description":"In terms of architecture, Dosanseowon Confucian Academy complex can largely be divided into Dosanseodang compound and Dosanseowon compound.

A painting of the caving titled Golgulseokgul by Gyeomjae Jeongseon, a famous painter of the era, revealed that there was once a wooden room located in front of the Maebul, but today only a hint of the room remains on the rock. The head of the Buddha (Yukgye) is perched solid and high on the body with a clear profile of the face ‚Äì sharp eyes, small lips and a long and narrow nose. In contrast to the three-dimensional face, the body is broader and flatter. The neck and upper chest sections have eroded over time. The folds in the clothing are nearly parallel, and the arm area has a v-pattern wrinkle, giving it a more realistic and three-dimensional quality. Around the head of the Buddha is a lotus-shaped halo, while the body is surrounded by a rhythmic flame-like halo. The Maebul is believed to have been created during the late Unified Silla Kingdom, as it shows similar craftsmanship to Seated Stone Vairocana Buddha (National Treasure No. 995), which was created in the year 876 and is located in Chukseosa Temple.","regDate":"2022-12-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-13-1670924193942"},{"id":"2022-12-13-1670920819064","title":"Sail Spa Land (ÏÇ¨ÏùºÏò®Ï≤ú)","description":"Sail Spa Land is uniquely located at the top of a mountain.
