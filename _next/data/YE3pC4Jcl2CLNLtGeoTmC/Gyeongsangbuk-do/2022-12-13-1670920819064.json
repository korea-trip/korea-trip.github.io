A painting of the caving titled Golgulseokgul by Gyeomjae Jeongseon, a famous painter of the era, revealed that there was once a wooden room located in front of the Maebul, but today only a hint of the room remains on the rock. The head of the Buddha (Yukgye) is perched solid and high on the body with a clear profile of the face ‚Äì sharp eyes, small lips and a long and narrow nose. In contrast to the three-dimensional face, the body is broader and flatter. The neck and upper chest sections have eroded over time. The folds in the clothing are nearly parallel, and the arm area has a v-pattern wrinkle, giving it a more realistic and three-dimensional quality. Around the head of the Buddha is a lotus-shaped halo, while the body is surrounded by a rhythmic flame-like halo. The Maebul is believed to have been created during the late Unified Silla Kingdom, as it shows similar craftsmanship to Seated Stone Vairocana Buddha (National Treasure No. 995), which was created in the year 876 and is located in Chukseosa Temple.","regDate":"2022-12-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-13-1670924193942"},{"id":"2022-12-13-1670916979531","title":"Robo Life Museum (Î°úÎ≥¥ÎùºÏù¥ÌîÑ ÎÆ§ÏßÄÏóÑ)","description":"The Robo Life Museum is a place where one can meet robots that are already part of our daily lives, knowingly and unknowingly.

Later, much of the forest was lost due to additional building construction, road expansion, and typhoon.

It was one of the 47 Confucian academies that was ruled out from the Confucian academy abolition order made by Heungseon Daewongun. Although the building structures do not carry significant meaning in architectural aspect, the distinguished space arrangement of the buildings is hard to go unnoticed.
