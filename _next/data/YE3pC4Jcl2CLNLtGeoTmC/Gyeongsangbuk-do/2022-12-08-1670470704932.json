Although the pronunciation of the name was never changed, its meaning slightly changed from ‚ÄúHigh Cloud Temple‚Äù to ‚ÄúSolitary Cloud Temple‚Äù after Choi Chi-won, a renowned scholar in the late Silla Period, helped to build two pavilions (Gaunru and Uhwaru) and renamed it. It is Branch Temple No.16 of the Korean Buddhist order, Jogyejong, and manages temples in Uiseong, Andong, Yeongju, Bonghwa, and Yeongyang. <br><br>Befitting its meaning, the temple is surrounded by outstanding scenery on Deungunsan Mountain, meaning ‚ÄúRiding on the Clouds.‚Äù  Quite isolated from villages, the temple is a very quiet, serene place.<br><br>Gounsa Temple is home to one of the most cherished pieces of architecture, Gaunru Pavilion (‚ÄúFloating over the Clouds‚Äù). This elegant pavilion is propped up by wooden columns, which are, in turn, supported by foundation stones. It looks as if the pavilion placed its feet in the water while standing.<br><br>Among the many buildings comprising the temple complex, Yeonsujeon Hall is a unique building that was built to store Eocheop (the genealogical record of royal families) in 1774 (20th year of King Yeongjo). As a royal building, it shows the Confucian architectural style, different from other Buddhist buildings within the temple.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-54-833-2324<br>+82-54-833-6933|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Not available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-08-1670470704932/721744_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-08-1670470704932/721744_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-08-1670470704932/721749_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-08-1670470704932/721749_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-08-1670470704932/721757_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-08-1670470704932/721757_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-08-1670470704932/721775_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-08-1670470704932/721775_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-08-1670470704932/721781_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-08-1670470704932/721781_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-08-1670470704932/721792_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-08-1670470704932/721792_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-08-1670470704932/721797_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-08-1670470704932/721797_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-08-1670470704932/721742_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-08-1670470704932/721742_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-54-833-2324](tel:+82548332324)\n- [üè†www.gounsa.net</a> (Korean only)<br><a href=\"https://www.templestay.com/temple_info.asp?t_id=gounsa\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"web\">www.templestay.comt](http://www.gounsa.net/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.4586393390\nlongitude: 128.7501073295\ntitle: 415, Gounsa-gil, Uiseong-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Local Bus]<br>\nTake Bus No. 438 from Andong Station to Gounsa Temple.<br><br>\n\n[Taxi]<br>\nApprox. 30 min from Andong Station\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-08-1670470704932","title":"Uiseong Gounsa Temple (Í≥†Ïö¥ÏÇ¨ (ÏùòÏÑ±))","description":"Gounsa Temple lies on Deungunsan Mountain in Uiseong, Gyeongsangbuk-do, and was built by Monk Uisang in 681 during the reign of King Sinmun of the Silla Kingdom.

A painting of the caving titled Golgulseokgul by Gyeomjae Jeongseon, a famous painter of the era, revealed that there was once a wooden room located in front of the Maebul, but today only a hint of the room remains on the rock. The head of the Buddha (Yukgye) is perched solid and high on the body with a clear profile of the face ‚Äì sharp eyes, small lips and a long and narrow nose. In contrast to the three-dimensional face, the body is broader and flatter. The neck and upper chest sections have eroded over time. The folds in the clothing are nearly parallel, and the arm area has a v-pattern wrinkle, giving it a more realistic and three-dimensional quality. Around the head of the Buddha is a lotus-shaped halo, while the body is surrounded by a rhythmic flame-like halo. The Maebul is believed to have been created during the late Unified Silla Kingdom, as it shows similar craftsmanship to Seated Stone Vairocana Buddha (National Treasure No. 995), which was created in the year 876 and is located in Chukseosa Temple.","regDate":"2022-12-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-13-1670924193942"},{"id":"2022-12-13-1670920819064","title":"Sail Spa Land (ÏÇ¨ÏùºÏò®Ï≤ú)","description":"Sail Spa Land is uniquely located at the top of a mountain.
