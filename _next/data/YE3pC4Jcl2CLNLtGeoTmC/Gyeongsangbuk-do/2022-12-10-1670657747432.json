{"pageProps":{"content":"\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> Andong Hahoe Doenjang Village is located by the crossroad of Hahoe Village and Byeongsanseowon Confucian Academy in Pungcheon-myeon, Andong-si. All of the buildings in the village are built purely of red clay and the villagers are devoted to preserving the 600 year-long tradition of doenjang (fermented soybean paste) making. <br><br>Over 3,000 large jars used for storing doenjang greet visitors at the village entrance. Highlights of the village include a red clay storage room capable of storing around 100 tons of soybeans, a giant iron pot for boiling up to 100 kilograms of beans at once, and a large glass drying room used for hanging meju (fermented soybean blocks) to dry. Using these features, doenjang is made by boiling domestically produced soybeans and shaping them into blocks of meju, which are then left to ferment and dry for 2 to 3 months. <br><br>The village facilities are comprised of an exhibition center at the entrance, a production center, and two drying rooms. The exhibition center invites visitors to sample various  fermented soybean condiments and displays all the products made in this village. The drying rooms are specially designed to allow maximum sunlight and ventilation. Finally, the production center preserves the traditional methods of making doenjang such as boiling soybeans in a giant iron pot and fermenting meju in a ondolbang (a room with the&nbsp;Korean floor heating system).\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-54-856-3013|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n  \n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-54-856-3013](tel:+82548563013)\n- [üè†www.tourandong.com](http://www.tourandong.com/public)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.5581710148\nlongitude: 128.5265687561\ntitle: 72, Jeonseo-ro, Andong-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Express/Intercity Bus]<br>\nFrom Central City Terminal, take an express bus bound for Andong.<br><br>\n\n[Local Bus]<br>\nFrom Andong Bus Terminal, take Bus No. 46 to Hahoe Village Bus Stop\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-10-1670657747432","title":"Andong Hahoe Doenjang Village (ÏïàÎèô ÌïòÌöåÎêúÏû•ÎßàÏùÑ)","description":"Andong Hahoe Doenjang Village is located by the crossroad of Hahoe Village and Byeongsanseowon Confucian Academy in Pungcheon-myeon, Andong-si.

A painting of the caving titled Golgulseokgul by Gyeomjae Jeongseon, a famous painter of the era, revealed that there was once a wooden room located in front of the Maebul, but today only a hint of the room remains on the rock. The head of the Buddha (Yukgye) is perched solid and high on the body with a clear profile of the face ‚Äì sharp eyes, small lips and a long and narrow nose. In contrast to the three-dimensional face, the body is broader and flatter. The neck and upper chest sections have eroded over time. The folds in the clothing are nearly parallel, and the arm area has a v-pattern wrinkle, giving it a more realistic and three-dimensional quality. Around the head of the Buddha is a lotus-shaped halo, while the body is surrounded by a rhythmic flame-like halo. The Maebul is believed to have been created during the late Unified Silla Kingdom, as it shows similar craftsmanship to Seated Stone Vairocana Buddha (National Treasure No. 995), which was created in the year 876 and is located in Chukseosa Temple.","regDate":"2022-12-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-13-1670924193942"},{"id":"2022-12-13-1670920819064","title":"Sail Spa Land (ÏÇ¨ÏùºÏò®Ï≤ú)","description":"Sail Spa Land is uniquely located at the top of a mountain.
