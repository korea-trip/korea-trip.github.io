Lee Seong-rye, the mother of Father Thomas Choi Yang-eop (Korea's second ordained priest), has not yet been canonized although she did suffer martyrdom. The reason was that the mother briefly put aside her faith because of the pressures of raising five children after she had her oldest son, Thomas. However, the difficulty of combining these two interests was eventually overcome and she died a martyr.<br><br>Aside from serving as a memorial site, Danggogae Catholic Martyrs' Shrine also offers a commanding view of Seoul. Nearby tourist attractions include Saenamteo Catholic Holy Place of the Martyrs, which is a Catholic church with Korean architecture, and Yongsan Family Park.","regDate":"2022-07-22","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Holy Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-22-1658463869048/566486_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-07-22-1658463869048","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Seoul/2022-07-22-1658463869048"},{"id":"2022-07-22-1658457979582","title":"Daehangno (University Street) (대학로)","description":"Daehangno is an artistic neighborhood that stretches 1.1 kilometers from Jongno 5-ga Intersection to Hyehwa-dong Rotary.
