Red pine trees salvaged from the demolition of Gyeongungung Palace were used to construct the house. It was originally located in Jegi-dong, Dongdaemun-gu, but was later restored and moved to its present location. The shrine of the house that was destroyed in 1960 was also restored. <br>\nBecause the house is more of a shrine rather than residential living quarters, it has many unique features. For example, unlike other houses, it has the <em>anchae</em> (women’s quarters) located across from <em>sarangbang</em> (men’s quarters) with <em>daecheong</em> (living room) positioned between them.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-2-3396-5882|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-23-1658601711010/1569164_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658601711010/1569164_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658601711010/1569165_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658601711010/1569165_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658601711010/1569167_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658601711010/1569167_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658601711010/2531125_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658601711010/2531125_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658601711010/2531126_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658601711010/2531126_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658601711010/2531128_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658601711010/2531128_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658601711010/2531129_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658601711010/2531129_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658601711010/2531130_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658601711010/2531130_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658601711010/2531131_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658601711010/2531131_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658601711010/2531132_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658601711010/2531132_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-2-3396-5882](tel:+82233965882)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5583638148\nlongitude: 126.9944031366\ntitle: 28, Toegye-ro 34-gil, Jung-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway]<BR>\nChungmuro Station (Seoul Subway Line 3, 4), Exit 3 or 4.<br>\nWalk for approx. 85 m to Namsangol Hanok Village.<br>\nHaepungbuwongun Yun Taekyeong's Jaesil is located inside Namsangol Hanok Village.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-23-1658601711010","title":"Haepungbuwongun Yun Taekyeong's Jaesil (해풍부원군윤택영댁재실)","description":"Haepungbuwongun Yun Taekyeong's Jaesil is a shrine house built by the father-in-law of King Sunjong of Joseon dynasty in 1906 when his daughter was proclaimed the crowned princess of Joseon and entered Changdeokgung Palace to later become Queen Sunjeong.

The Military Museum displays treasures and materials from each branch of the military, while visitors can see the history of the military and lifestyle of cadets at the memorial hall.

The theme park provides children with a chance to experience jobs that they might want to have when they grow up! Job experiences include working as a policeman, flight attendant, firefighter, or chef (uniforms are provided). When you work hard in Kidzania, you get paid in Kidzo (a virtual currency). You can put your money in the bank for your next visit or purchase goods at the department store. In order to make the environment as realistic as possible, every building, car, and tree is reduced to 2/3 its real size, helping children feel more adult-like in their new world! Kidzania mimics a real city environment, has diverse jobs, and is full of events. When there is a fire, a fireman rushes to help, and a news reporter covers the story. While 911 paramedics give first aid to fire victims, in another part of “town” delivery personnel are dropping off packages. Kidzania teaches the next generation how to live as responsible members of society and gives them an introduction to how the economy works.","regDate":"2022-08-04","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Experience Programs","Unique Experience"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-04-1659656133025/2031380_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-08-04-1659656133025"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
