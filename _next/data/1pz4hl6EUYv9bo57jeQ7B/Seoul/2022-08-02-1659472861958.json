{"pageProps":{"content":"![Hwangudan Altar (환구단)](/2022-08-02-1659472861958/1946566_image2_1.webp)\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> Hwangudan Altar, also called Hwandan Altar, refers to an altar complex for the rite of heaven. The rites were first performed in the Goryeo dynasty by King Seongjong in the first month of 983 (2nd year of his reign), but was repeatedly adopted and abolished, and eventually stopped at the start of the Joseon dynasty. <br><br>Then in 1456 (2nd year of King Sejo), the practice was temporarily standardized and the rites were performed at Hwangudan Altar again in 1457. However, rites were again abolished in 1464 (10th year of King Sejo). It wasn’t until 1897 (34th year of King Gojong) when the Joseon dynasty was renamed as the Korean Empire and King Gojong ascended to emperor, that the rite was revived. \n<br><br>\nNow, Hwangungu Shrine and three stone drums stand at the location of the former altar complex. The three stone drums symbolize the instruments used for the rites. The shrine was completed in 1899, two years after the altar was started in 1897. Today, the Hwangungu Shrine still stands within the hotel grounds of the Westin Chosun Hotel.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-2-3396-5842|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-02-1659472861958/1570572_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659472861958/1570572_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659472861958/1570573_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659472861958/1570573_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659472861958/1570574_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659472861958/1570574_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659472861958/1570575_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659472861958/1570575_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659472861958/1570576_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659472861958/1570576_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-2-3396-5842](tel:+82233965842)\n- [🏠www.junggu.seoul.kr/tour</a> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br><a href=\" http://www.cha.go.kr\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"web\">www.cha.go.kr](http://www.junggu.seoul.kr/tour)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5651627568\nlongitude: 126.9794848592\ntitle: 112, Sogong-ro, Jung-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway]<br>\nFrom City Hall Station (Seoul Subway Line 1 & 2), Exit 5.<br>\nWalk straight and cross the road at the intersection.<br>\nCross the street on the right.<br>\nThe entrance to Hwangudan Altar is on the left.\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-02-1659472861958","title":"Hwangudan Altar (환구단)","description":"Hwangudan Altar, also called Hwandan Altar, refers to an altar complex for the rite of heaven.

It was extremely difficult for outsiders to visit the academy until 1997, when a special tourism course was created. The course showcases the major sites at Korea Military Academy. Starting from the school information center, visitors can see the museum, memorial hall, and exhibition center in a 1.5 hour course. The Military Museum displays treasures and materials from each branch of the military, while visitors can see the history of the military and lifestyle of cadets at the memorial hall. However, the highlight of a trip to Korea Military Academy is watching the Hwarang Ceremony, a parade of cadets which takes place every Saturday at 11 30.

The theme park provides children with a chance to experience jobs that they might want to have when they grow up! Job experiences include working as a policeman, flight attendant, firefighter, or chef (uniforms are provided). When you work hard in Kidzania, you get paid in Kidzo (a virtual currency). You can put your money in the bank for your next visit or purchase goods at the department store. In order to make the environment as realistic as possible, every building, car, and tree is reduced to 2/3 its real size, helping children feel more adult-like in their new world! Kidzania mimics a real city environment, has diverse jobs, and is full of events. When there is a fire, a fireman rushes to help, and a news reporter covers the story. While 911 paramedics give first aid to fire victims, in another part of “town” delivery personnel are dropping off packages. Kidzania teaches the next generation how to live as responsible members of society and gives them an introduction to how the economy works.","regDate":"2022-08-04","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Experience Programs","Unique Experience"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-04-1659656133025/2031380_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-08-04-1659656133025"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
