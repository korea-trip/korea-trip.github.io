Heunginjimun Gate was the gate on the east side of the outer wall of Seoul Fortress among eight gates. It is referred to as Dongdaemun Gate as well. The gate was constructed during King Taejo’s 5th year in 1396, remodeled during the reign of King Danjong in 1453 and was newly built in 1869 during the sixth year of King Gojong’s reign in 1869. <br><br>\n\nThe gate features a hipped roof which has five front compartments and two side compartments on a two-storied building. The thin and weak bracket system supports the eaves and is excessively decorated, reflecting the construction features of the late Joseon period. Also, outside of the fortress is the half-circle shaped Ongseong, a small wall, to protect the gate.\n<br><br>\nOne of the unique factors of Heunginjimun Gate is that it is the only gate among Seoul’s eight to have Ongseong, further exhibiting the style of construction used during the late Joseon period as well.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br> • For more info: +82-2-2148-1842|\n|parking:|Not available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-02-1659451203684/1568434_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659451203684/1568434_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659451203684/1568435_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659451203684/1568435_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659451203684/1568437_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659451203684/1568437_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659451203684/1568438_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659451203684/1568438_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659451203684/1568439_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659451203684/1568439_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659451203684/1985132_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659451203684/1985132_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659451203684/1985133_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659451203684/1985133_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659451203684/1985134_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659451203684/1985134_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659451203684/2536327_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659451203684/2536327_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659451203684/1985136_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659451203684/1985136_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-2-2148-1842](tel:+82221481842)\n- [🏠tour.jongno.go.kr](http://tour.jongno.go.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5711931512\nlongitude: 127.0095263952\ntitle: 288, Jong-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-02-1659451203684","title":"Heunginjimun Gate - Dongdaemun Gate (흥인지문)","description":"Heunginjimun Gate was built to protect Hanseongbu, which historically housed important government facilities.

The Military Museum displays treasures and materials from each branch of the military, while visitors can see the history of the military and lifestyle of cadets at the memorial hall.

The theme park provides children with a chance to experience jobs that they might want to have when they grow up! Job experiences include working as a policeman, flight attendant, firefighter, or chef (uniforms are provided). When you work hard in Kidzania, you get paid in Kidzo (a virtual currency). You can put your money in the bank for your next visit or purchase goods at the department store. In order to make the environment as realistic as possible, every building, car, and tree is reduced to 2/3 its real size, helping children feel more adult-like in their new world! Kidzania mimics a real city environment, has diverse jobs, and is full of events. When there is a fire, a fireman rushes to help, and a news reporter covers the story. While 911 paramedics give first aid to fire victims, in another part of “town” delivery personnel are dropping off packages. Kidzania teaches the next generation how to live as responsible members of society and gives them an introduction to how the economy works.","regDate":"2022-08-04","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Experience Programs","Unique Experience"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-04-1659656133025/2031380_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-08-04-1659656133025"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
