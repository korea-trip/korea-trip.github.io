This neighborhood expanded into an art complex when artists from diverse fields of expertise began to gather during the development process of Paju Book City. The village‚Äôs name originates from Paju‚Äôs local song ‚ÄúHeyri Sound,‚Äù sung by farmers while working at the fields. The whole neighborhood is like a masterpiece due to the artworks displayed along the streets in harmony with nature‚Äôs beauty. The buildings were carefully designed as to prevent the manmade structures getting in the way from admiring the surrounding nature. For example, the neighborhood‚Äôs streets were designed to follow the curves set by nature without using any asphalt.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-31-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-31-946-8551|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|Mondays (Refer to website for details)|\n|usetime:|Varies by area (Refer to website for details)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Gallery, exhibition hall, museum, theater, art shop, book store, guesthouse, restaurant, cafe|\n|Admission Fees:|Free<br>* Fees may apply to exhibitions and galleries.|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706540_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706540_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706541_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706541_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706548_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706548_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706550_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706550_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706552_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706552_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706553_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706553_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706555_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706555_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706557_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706557_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706558_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706558_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706538_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-26-1661499675782/2706538_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-31-946-8551](tel:+82319468551)\n- [üè†www.heyri.net](http://heyri.net)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.7880651301\nlongitude: 126.6993124807\ntitle: 70-21, Heyrimaeul-gil, Paju-si, Gyeonggi-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway + Bus]<br>\n Hapjeong Station (Seoul Subway Line 2), Exit 2. <br> Take Bus No. 2200 or 900 and get off at Heyri Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-26-1661499675782","title":"Heyri Art Valley (Ìó§Ïù¥Î¶¨ ÏòàÏà†ÎßàÏùÑ)","description":"Heyri Art Valley is a neighborhood of inspiration, creative workshops, exhibitions, festivals, and education of all things creative arts.

Gaeseong, Suwon, Ganghwa and Gwangju are located in the north, south, west, and east direction respectively. Namhansanseong Fortress is located to the east in Gwangju. The park is situated on Namhansan Mountain, 24km southeast from Seoul and 6km northeast from Seongnam. The length of trails is a total of approximately 12.4 km (main fortress 8.9km, external fortress 3.2km, Sinnamsanseong Fortress 0.2km). The x_height is 7.3m.<br><br>The fortress is alternately recorded as being the royal fortress of King Onjo of the Baekje Kingdom, whose father was King Dongmyeong during Goguryeo period or a fortress built in 673 during the reign of King Munmu (the 13th year) of Silla period during the heat of the Silla and Tang War. The old site was rebuilt several times, with its current style of construction being built in 1621 during King Gwanghae‚Äôs reign. <br><br> Namhansanseong‚Äôs circumference is approximately 12km, stacking small natural stones over big stones. The fortress includes Sueocheong (Namhansan Mountain Fortress Defense Command), Gwana (government office), storage, and a haenggung (temporary palace), as well as 80 wells and 45 springs. Also, administration was moved from Gwangju-eup to inside of the fortress, clearly showing the importance of Namhansanseong Fortress in that period. 12,700 people participated in a field exercise carried out for the first time after building the fortress by command of King Injo (17th year, 1639). These days, only a few buildings remain inside of the fortress including East and South Gate, Seojangdae, Hyeonjeolsa Temple, Yeonmu Hall, Janggyeongsa Temple, Jisudang, Yeongwoljeong, and Chimgwaejeong. Among these remaining buildings, four gates, Sueojangdae, and some parts of the fortress in the middle of West Gate still maintain their original forms. Namhansanseong Fortress is designated as Historical Site No. 57 and a provincial park.","regDate":"2022-09-01","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Provincial Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-01-1662018070165/1589317_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-09-01-1662018070165"},{"id":"2022-09-01-1662015399315","title":"Myeongseongsan Mountain (Î™ÖÏÑ±ÏÇ∞)","description":"Situated on the border between Cheorwon (Gangwon-do) and Pocheon (Gyeonggi-do), Myeongseongsan Mountain is renowned for its beautiful fall foliage and fields of silver grass.

Visitors can feel the peaceful and serene atmosphere when walking around the site.
