More than 97% of the land around the Gunnam flood control dam is part of North Korea. The site is effective in controlling the flooding of the Imjingang River and improving irregular water flow. This area is a key wintering site for various migratory birds such as white-naped cranes, and hooded cranes, with up to 200 birds spending every winter in the area. Given the unique characteristics created by the geographical condition of the area near the border between South and North Korea and the natural environment of the Imjingang River, the site is a great natural ecological habitat for various wildlife. \n<br><br>\nThe Gunnam Flood Control Theme Park features ‚ÄúThe Story of Peace and Love told by Cranes‚Äù as its theme. Various story-telling facilities are installed, such as the drum of peace, a wishing tree, and crane structures. There are also outstanding facilities to minimize impact on the environment, such as an alternative habitat for cranes, fishway ecology, and ecological wetlands. The facility makes it a great place to learn about and experience ecology.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-31-839-2024|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Tour Course Information:|* Durumi-gil (Crane Road) (30 km)<br>* Taepung-gil (Typhoon Road) (23 km)<br>* Park Promenade (3 km)|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-25-1661407658717/2480736_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-25-1661407658717/2480736_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-25-1661407658717/2480737_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-25-1661407658717/2480737_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-25-1661407658717/2480738_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-25-1661407658717/2480738_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-25-1661407658717/2480739_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-25-1661407658717/2480739_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-25-1661407658717/2480740_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-25-1661407658717/2480740_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-25-1661407658717/2480742_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-25-1661407658717/2480742_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-25-1661407658717/2480743_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-25-1661407658717/2480743_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-31-839-2024](tel:+82318392024)\n- [üè†dmz.go.kr](https://dmz.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 38.1039312532\nlongitude: 127.0207183918\ntitle: Gunnam-myeon, Yeoncheon-gun, Gyeonggi-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-25-1661407658717","title":"Gunnam Flood Control Theme Park (Íµ∞ÎÇ®ÌôçÏàòÏ°∞Ï†àÏßÄ ÎëêÎ£®ÎØ∏ÌÖåÎßàÌååÌÅ¨)","description":"The Gunnam Flood Control Site is situated near the border between North and South Korea just six kilometers away from the demarcation line.

Gaeseong, Suwon, Ganghwa and Gwangju are located in the north, south, west, and east direction respectively. Namhansanseong Fortress is located to the east in Gwangju. The park is situated on Namhansan Mountain, 24km southeast from Seoul and 6km northeast from Seongnam. The length of trails is a total of approximately 12.4 km (main fortress 8.9km, external fortress 3.2km, Sinnamsanseong Fortress 0.2km). The x_height is 7.3m.<br><br>The fortress is alternately recorded as being the royal fortress of King Onjo of the Baekje Kingdom, whose father was King Dongmyeong during Goguryeo period or a fortress built in 673 during the reign of King Munmu (the 13th year) of Silla period during the heat of the Silla and Tang War. The old site was rebuilt several times, with its current style of construction being built in 1621 during King Gwanghae‚Äôs reign. <br><br> Namhansanseong‚Äôs circumference is approximately 12km, stacking small natural stones over big stones. The fortress includes Sueocheong (Namhansan Mountain Fortress Defense Command), Gwana (government office), storage, and a haenggung (temporary palace), as well as 80 wells and 45 springs. Also, administration was moved from Gwangju-eup to inside of the fortress, clearly showing the importance of Namhansanseong Fortress in that period. 12,700 people participated in a field exercise carried out for the first time after building the fortress by command of King Injo (17th year, 1639). These days, only a few buildings remain inside of the fortress including East and South Gate, Seojangdae, Hyeonjeolsa Temple, Yeonmu Hall, Janggyeongsa Temple, Jisudang, Yeongwoljeong, and Chimgwaejeong. Among these remaining buildings, four gates, Sueojangdae, and some parts of the fortress in the middle of West Gate still maintain their original forms. Namhansanseong Fortress is designated as Historical Site No. 57 and a provincial park.","regDate":"2022-09-01","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Provincial Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-01-1662018070165/1589317_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-09-01-1662018070165"},{"id":"2022-09-01-1662015399315","title":"Myeongseongsan Mountain (Î™ÖÏÑ±ÏÇ∞)","description":"Situated on the border between Cheorwon (Gangwon-do) and Pocheon (Gyeonggi-do), Myeongseongsan Mountain is renowned for its beautiful fall foliage and fields of silver grass.
