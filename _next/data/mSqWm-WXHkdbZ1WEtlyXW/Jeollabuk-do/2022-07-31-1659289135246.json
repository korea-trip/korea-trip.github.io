Officially designated a city park in April 1978, it is centered around a natural pond, which dates back to the Goryeo dynasty (918-1392). The park is such a landmark of the area that the lotus flowers blooming in the park‚Äôs large pond are considered one of the most impressive attractions of Jeonju. The park spans an area of 13,000 „é° with the pond covering about two thirds of the southern sector. An arch-shaped suspension bridge stretches across the middle of the pond, offering up-close views of the lotus blossoms. <br><br>\n\nPark designers created a traditional pavilion and a water iris garden in honor of the park‚Äôs historical background and added an artificial waterfall and wooden bridge for visual effect. The park also houses nine stone monuments including the Children‚Äôs Charter, engravings of Shin Seok-jeong and Kim Hae-gang‚Äôs poetry, and a statue of General Jeon Bong-jun. <br><br>\n\nThe park is the site of the annual Dano Changpomul (Water Iris) Festival, a much-anticipated event held on the day of Dano (a Korean traditional holiday that falls on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month). During the celebration, women wash their hair in iris-infused water from the pond to wish for good health in the coming year.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-63-239-2607|\n|parking:|Available (70 spaces)|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|useseason:|Mid-July~early August (Lotus flower blooming season)|\n|usetime:|Open 24 hr|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-31-1659289135246/1605385_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659289135246/1605385_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659289135246/1605387_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659289135246/1605387_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659289135246/1605388_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659289135246/1605388_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659289135246/1605389_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659289135246/1605389_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659289135246/1605390_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659289135246/1605390_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659289135246/1605391_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659289135246/1605391_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659289135246/2366391_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659289135246/2366391_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659289135246/2366392_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659289135246/2366392_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659289135246/2366394_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659289135246/2366394_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659289135246/2366395_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659289135246/2366395_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-63-239-2607](tel:+82632392607)\n- [üè†www.jjss.or.kr](http://www.jjss.or.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.8475156135\nlongitude: 127.1218687977\ntitle: 390, Gwonsamdeuk-ro, Deokjin-gu, Jeonju-si, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-31-1659289135246","title":"Deokjin Park (ÎçïÏßÑÍ≥µÏõê)","description":"Deokjin Park is a representative city park of Jeonju.

According to Samgukyusa (historical records published in 1281), King Mu (30th king of Baekje, in power AD 600-641) and his wife Queen Seonhwa were said to have seen a vision of Mireuksamjon (the three Sanskrit) emerging from a large pond. At the time of their revelation, the king and queen were on their way to visit a Buddhist monk in Sajasa Temple on Yonghwasan Mountain (now known as Mireuksan Mountain). In response to their vision, the king drained the nearby pond and established Mireuksa Temple. The temple is believed to have shown the most advanced architectural and cultural skills of Baekje, Silla, and Goguryeo (the three main kingdoms at that time). Records indicate that King Jinpyeong of Silla even sent his craftsmen over to assist with the temple construction. <br><br>The two main features of the Mireuksa Temple Site are the stone pagoda (Mireuksaji Seoktap) and the flagpole supports (Mireuksaji Dangganjiju). The 14.24-meter-high west stone pagoda (National Treasure No. 11) is the oldest and largest Korean stone pagoda in existence. The west pagoda currently has only six tiers, but is estimated to originally have had nine. The nine-story east stone pagoda (27.67 meters in x_height) was restored to its original stature in 1993 based on historical records. Other surviving landmarks include the flagpole supports (Treasure No. 236) to the south of the stone pagodas. The 395 centimeter-tall poles are estimated to have been created during the Unified Silla period (AD 676-935) and are set 90 meters apart from east to west.","regDate":"2023-01-06","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-06-1672983362269/2514985_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-06-1672983362269"},{"id":"2023-01-06-1672979958647","title":"Manghaesa Temple (ÎßùÌï¥ÏÇ¨)","description":"Manghaesa Temple is located at the edge of the Gimje Plains before the sea.

The temple was established by the great monk Buseol Geosa during the 2nd year of King Uija of Baekje (AD 642). Years later, Dobeopsa (a Chinese monk from the Tang dynasty) renovated the temple. The temple was altered again during the reign of King Injo of the Joseon dynasty when the great monk Jinmuk Daesa built Nakseojeon Hall in 1589. Bogwangjeon Hall and Chilseonggak Pavilion were built much later in 1933. Manghaesa Temple is unique in that it is the only temple where the distant horizon is visible over both land and sea.

In the early Joseon period the mountain was named ‚ÄòSokgeumsan,‚Äô but began to be called ‚ÄòMaisan‚Äô after the 12th year of King Taejong, who commented that the two peaks resembled horse ears (‚Äòmaisan‚Äô meaning ‚Äòhorse ears‚Äô). All along Maisan Mountain, visitors will find small crater-like rock cavities that are formed by prolonged weathering. These unique geological features, called ‚Äòtafoni,‚Äô are of great academic value. <br><br>Inside Hwaeomgul Cave, visitors can observe medicinal water that flows up from underground all throughout the year. It is widely believed that once you drink the water, especially on the days of the Spring and Autumn Equinox, you will soon have a son and be blessed by the mountain spirit.
