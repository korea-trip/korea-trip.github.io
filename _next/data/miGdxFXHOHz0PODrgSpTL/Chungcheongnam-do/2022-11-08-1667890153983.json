At that time, Catholics were executed outside Haemieupseong Fortress Seomun Gate (West Gate). As it was difficult to execute them one by one, the martyrs were buried alive in a big hole all at once. When confronted with their deaths, the martyrs prayed while singing Yesumaria (Jesus Maria). Because it also sounds like  Yeosumeori,  the place was called Yeosutgol as well.<br><br>The 16-meter-high memorial&nbsp;tower was set set up near Haemicheon Stream to pay tribute to the nameless martyrs who were buried alive. Many Catholics visit this location every year to remember and honor the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for their belief.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-41-688-3183|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n  \n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-41-688-3183](tel:+82416883183)\n- [🏠www.haemi.or.kr](http://www.haemi.or.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.7125425452\nlongitude: 126.5376428206\ntitle: 13, Seongji 1-ro, Seosan-si, Chungcheongnam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Central City Terminal, take an express bus to Seosan Bus Terminal.<br>\nFrom Seosan Bus Terminal, take Bus No. 510 (Haemi, Air Force, Haemi Girls' High School) and get off at Banyang-ri Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-08-1667890153983","title":"Haemi Martyrdom Holy Ground (Yeosutgol) (해미순교성지(여숫골))","description":"Haemi Martyrdom Holy Ground is the site where nearly 1,000 Catholics in Chungcheongnam-do were buried alive during the time between the  Byeongin Persecution in 1866 and 1882.
