Each brick is 27.5 cm (10 4/5 inches) long, 6 cm (2 1/3 inches) thick and 12.5 cm wide (4 9/10 inches). In the past, it was 7 stories high. In 1598, during the Japanese Invasion of Korea, the top motif was destroyed and the structure was further damaged during the Korean War. The pagoda was repaired in 1962. Rumour has it that the pagoda was once located inside the old Beomnimsa Temple. The Dangganjiju, which is located 5 meters west from the pagoda, supports this story. One can see the small place to keep sculptures of the god on each floor.<br> By looking at these with the tiled roof, it is possible to see what style was fashionable. On the second story from the southern viewpoint, one can see the beautiful remnants of the In Wang-sang statue. It is conveniently located on the left side of an open space at the end of the parking lot at Andong Train Station.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-54-856-3013|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-23-1669181800462/178271_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-23-1669181800462/178271_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-23-1669181800462/1919406_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-23-1669181800462/1919406_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-23-1669181800462/1919407_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-23-1669181800462/1919407_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-23-1669181800462/1919409_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-23-1669181800462/1919409_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-23-1669181800462/1919411_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-23-1669181800462/1919411_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-23-1669181800462/2534102_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-23-1669181800462/2534102_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-23-1669181800462/2534104_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-23-1669181800462/2534104_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-23-1669181800462/2534106_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-23-1669181800462/2534106_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-23-1669181800462/2534107_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-23-1669181800462/2534107_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-23-1669181800462/1919408_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-23-1669181800462/1919408_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-54-856-3013](tel:+82548563013)\n- [üè†www.tourandong.com</a> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br /><a href=\"http://www.cha.go.kr/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Î¨∏ÌôîÏû¨Ï≤≠ ÏÇ¨Ïù¥Ìä∏Î°ú Ïù¥Îèô\">www.cha.go.kr](http://www.tourandong.com)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.5625826872\nlongitude: 128.7313115489\ntitle: 231, Eunheung-dong, Andong-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Train]<BR>\nWith your back to Andong Station, walk left for approx. 2 min. and it will be located at the parking lot (behind the tourist information center).\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-23-1669181800462","title":"Dangganjiju (Flagpole Supports) in Unheung-dong and Five-Story Brick Pagoda in Dongbu-dong (ÏïàÎèô Ïö¥Ìù•Îèô ÎãπÍ∞ÑÏßÄÏ£ºÏôÄ Ïò§Ï∏µÏ†ÑÌÉë)","description":"In Dongbu-dong, there is a 8.35 meters (27 4/10 feet) high brick pagoda from the Unified Silla Kingdom Period (AD 654-935).
