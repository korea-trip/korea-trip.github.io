During the early years of Catholicism in Korea, Catholics fleeing from the Sinhae Persecution (1791) came to this place, formed a community, and made their faith deeper. Amid the persecution in 1801, A man named Hwang Sa-yeong (Alexander, 1775–1801) hid in a tunnel and wrote letters about the situation of the Joseon Catholic Church on silk fabrics, but was captured and martyred. Baeron is also a historic place where Joseon’s first theological school, St. Joseph Theological School, was founded, but the school was eventually shut down. The graves of Fr. Thomas Choe Yang-eop (1821–1861), Korea’s second Roman Catholic priest, and the Martyr Hwang Sa-yeong Memorial Tower can be seen at Baeron Holy Ground.<br>\n <br>\n Baeron Holy Ground is surrounded by rugged mountains such as Guhaksan Mountain, Baegunsan Mountain and Chiaksan Mountain.
