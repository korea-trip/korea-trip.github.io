{"pageProps":{"content":"![Gugokpokpo Falls (구곡폭포)](/2022-09-25-1664088775156/1583495_image2_1.webp)\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> Located at the foot of Bonghwasan Mountain in Chuncheon, Gugok Falls with a x_height of 50 m is one of the representative tourist destinations in the Gangchon area. It was named “Gugok” because the falls twist (gok) and turn nine (gu) different times before dropping down, and is also called “Guguripokpo.” Gugok Falls flowing down from a huge stone wall create fantastic scenery. Many tourists visit the falls every year to enjoy cool, refreshing water to overcome the heat wave in summer and to admire a majestic view of the giant ice wall in winter. The road from the ticket booth to the falls is gentle and requires about 20 min walk. It is an easy walking path surrounded by woods and the valley. Visitors can also try to find the nine wooden panels inspired by the spirit of Gugok and designed with Hangeul alphabet “ㄲ” letters (such as 꿈, 끼, 꾀, 깡, etc.). If you go up for about 40 min along the Kkalttak Pass, which is on the right side of the Gugok Falls entrance, you will find Munbae Village, nestled in a basin. The village restaurants are known for local dishes, such as wild vegetable bibimbap and folk liquor. Visitors can also stay overnight at the National Leisure Campground built in the Gukgok Falls Tourist Area.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-33-261-0088|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|Open year round|\n|usetime:|08:30–17:30(It is subject to the weather.)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|People aged 7 to 65: KRW 2,000, Persons of national merit, the elderly, preschoolers, PWD, and residents in the lake culture zone (Chuncheon, Yanggu, Hwacheon, Hongcheon, and Inje): Free of charge|\n|Parking Fees:|Subcompact vehicles: KRW 1,000, Small vehicles: KRW 2,000, Large vehicles: KRW 4,000|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-09-25-1664088775156/1583493_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664088775156/1583493_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664088775156/1780589_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664088775156/1780589_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664088775156/1780590_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664088775156/1780590_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-33-261-0088](tel:+82332610088)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.7939337577\nlongitude: 127.6092986794\ntitle: 254, Gangchongugok-gil, Namsan-myeon, Chuncheon-si, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Gangchon Station, take Bus No. 50 or 50-1 and get off at Gugokpokpo Falls Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-09-25-1664088775156","title":"Gugokpokpo Falls (구곡폭포)","description":"Located at the foot of Bonghwasan Mountain in Chuncheon, Gugok Falls with a x_height of 50 m is one of the representative tourist destinations in the Gangchon area.

The peak is made of strange rocks stretching from the foot of the mountain to the top at 900 m above sea level. The peak consists of six rocks, which create a majestic view of the rocky peak. The peak with the circumference of 4 km forms a great panoramic view along with Daecheongbong Peak and Outer Seorak. Ulsan Peak presents an imposing scene, and it was visited by many famous poets and calligraphers including Choe Yeon and Heo Jeok during the Joseon period who left behind their records. In addition, several legends are associated with Ulsan Peak. One day, a heavenly god commanded peaks of all mountains to assemble at Geumgangsan Mountain to create the greatest scenery. However, the Ulsan Peak was too heavy, so it was late for the meeting. Feeling ashamed, it didn’t go back home (Ulsan) directly, and took a rest at Seoraksan Mountain, but stayed there forever. Also, there is a saying that the peak was named after the shape of the rock, which resembles a fence (ul+tari) or a crying (ul) mountain (san). Visitors can get to the Ulsan Peak by starting from the small park and passing through Sinheungsa Temple and Heundeul Rock. At the beginning of the path, it starts with a gentle slope, but after the Heundeul Rock, there are a steep rocky hill and the iron stairs. It requires about 4 hr for getting to and from the peak. It is hard for the elderly or children to climb because of high level of difficulty.","regDate":"2022-10-16","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Resources","Rocks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-16-1665913620696/2711195_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-16-1665913620696"},{"id":"2022-10-16-1665910327005","title":"Uisangdae Pavilion (낙산사 의상대)","description":"This pavilion is located on a seaside cliff on the way from Yangyang’s Naksansa Temple to Gwaneumgul Cave of Hongnyeonam Hermitage. The word “dae” in Uisangdae refers to a building built at a vantage point for areas with beautiful scenery. Indeed, the view of the East Sea and the coast from Uisangdae Pavilion awarded its recognition as one of the Eight Sights of Yangyang, and a must-visit place for all visitors to Naksansa Temple. Jeong Cheol (pen-name  Songgang), a famed scholar and writer of the poem Song of Diamond Mountains, chose the pavilion as one of the Eight Sights of Gwandong, and the pavilion is today one of the popular sites for sunrise-viewing on the east coast of Korea. Together with Hongnyeonam Hermitage, it is designated as the Scenic Site No. 27 of Korea under the name “Uisangdae Pavilion and Hongnyeonam Hermitage of Naksansa Temple, Yangyang.” Uisangdae is named after Uisang, a respected Silla-era Buddhist monk who is said to have founded this temple in 671 (11th year of King Munmu’s reign of Silla), and many stories of his deeds can still be found in the temple. For instance, Uisangdae is said to be the site where he meditated before founding Naksansa Temple at its present site. Today’s pavilion was restored to its present hexagonal form in 1995.","regDate":"2022-10-16","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-16-1665910327005/2711338_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-16-1665910327005"},{"id":"2022-10-16-1665906295356","title":"Uiamho Lake Skywalk (의암호 스카이워크)","description":"Uiamho Lake Skywalk, one of the two largest skywalks in Chuncheon along with Soyanggang Skywalk, is located on Uiamho Bike Path between Kim Youjeong Memorial Stone and Chuncheon Songam Sports Town in the Uiam Lakeside. Connecting with the water bridge section of the bike path, Uiamho Lake Skywalk consists of a 10 m-long straight section and a 10 m-diameter circular section, located 12 m above the water. The entire floor is made of transparent glass, so visitors will feel like walking on the water. When you stand on the skywalk, you will encounter a picturesque view of Samaksan Mountain and Uiamho Lake. Soyanggang Skywalk boasts another splendid scenery of Chuncheon. Although the access from the Kim Youjeong Memorial Stone is close to Uiam Lake Skywalk, parking space is insufficient, thus, it is recommended to use the public parking lot near Chuncheon Songam Sports Town. It takes 15 min by foot or bike along the Uiamho Bike Path from the public parking lot to Uiam Lake Skywalk. It is a great place for a stroll amid the magnificent landscape.","regDate":"2022-10-16","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Culture/Art/History","Architectural Sights","Monuments/Observatories"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-16-1665906295356/2605228_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-16-1665906295356"},{"id":"2022-10-16-1665903453154","title":"Ttansan Mountain (딴산)","description":"Located just four kilometers away from Hwacheon-eup, Ttansan Mountain is nestled between Paroho Lake and the entrance to Peace Dam, making it appear more like an island floating on the water rather than a mountain. <br>This small island-like mountain offers an interesting and unique setting and the nearby mountains provide a cooling effect with its shadows on the water creating a relaxing resting area.","regDate":"2022-10-16","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-16-1665903453154/2020509_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-16-1665903453154"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
