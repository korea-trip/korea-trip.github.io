{"pageProps":{"content":"![Naksansa Temple (ÎÇôÏÇ∞ÏÇ¨)](/2022-10-06-1665042428834/2711347_image2_1.webp)\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> This ancient temple was built in the 11th year of King Munmu‚Äôs reign of Silla (671) by the Buddhist monk Uisang. Naksansa Temple is one of the foremost sights of Yangyang, and one of the most historic sites in the region. Along with Ganghwa‚Äôs Bomunsa Temple and Namhae‚Äôs Boriam Hermitage, it is said to be one of the three centers of the cult of Avalokitesvara in Korea. Its handsome view overlooking the East Sea has earned it a spot in the Eight Sights of Gwandong (eight famous sights in Yeongdong region of Gangwon-do), documented throughout the ages in many classic literature and poetry. Today‚Äôs Naksansa Temple is a product of many restorations and expansions, and has many examples of cultural heritage within its walls. There is a 16 meter-tall statue of the Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva to Uisangdae, a pavilion built to overlook the sunrise over the East Sea on a coastal cliff, Hongnyeonam Hermitage, built over the crashing waves, Seven-story Stone Pagoda of Naksansa Temple, Yangyang (Treasure No. 499), a Joseon-era pagoda with Goryeo-era style, and Stupa, Stele, and Reliquaries of Naksansa Temple, Yangyang (Treasure No. 1723), including a number of sarira. A mountain fire in 2005 resulted in the loss of 20 buildings, including the building that housed its bronze bell (formerly Treasure No. 479 of Korea). The temple also operates templestay programs available through its website.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-33-672-2447~8|\n|opendate:|1953|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|06:00‚Äì19:30 (visitors must exit the complex by 20:30)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Film Locations:|Drama \"Taejo Wang Geon (2000)\"|\n|Admission Fees:| [Entrance to Naksansa Temple&rsquo;s Cultural Heritage]<br> Individual: Adults 4,000 won / Teenagers 1,500 won / Children 1,000 won<br> Group: Adults 3,000 won / Teenagers 1,000 won / Children 700 won<br> |\n|Parking Fees:|4,000 won|\n|Available Facilities:|Uisangdae Pavilion, Naksansa Temple|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Not available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-10-06-1665042428834/2649028_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665042428834/2649028_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-06-1665042428834/2649029_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665042428834/2649029_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-06-1665042428834/2649031_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665042428834/2649031_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-06-1665042428834/2649035_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665042428834/2649035_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-06-1665042428834/2711349_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665042428834/2711349_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-06-1665042428834/2711350_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665042428834/2711350_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-06-1665042428834/2711351_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665042428834/2711351_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-06-1665042428834/2716319_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665042428834/2716319_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-06-1665042428834/2716320_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665042428834/2716320_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-06-1665042428834/2649030_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665042428834/2649030_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-33-672-2447](tel:+82336722447)\n- [üè†www.naksansa.or.kr](http://www.naksansa.or.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 38.1248562734\nlongitude: 128.6273544905\ntitle: 100, Naksansa-ro, Yangyang-gun, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-10-06-1665042428834","title":"Naksansa Temple (ÎÇôÏÇ∞ÏÇ¨)","description":"This ancient temple was built in the 11th year of King Munmu‚Äôs reign of Silla (671) by the Buddhist monk Uisang.

The peak is made of strange rocks stretching from the foot of the mountain to the top at 900 m above sea level. The peak consists of six rocks, which create a majestic view of the rocky peak. The peak with the circumference of 4 km forms a great panoramic view along with Daecheongbong Peak and Outer Seorak. Ulsan Peak presents an imposing scene, and it was visited by many famous poets and calligraphers including Choe Yeon and Heo Jeok during the Joseon period who left behind their records. In addition, several legends are associated with Ulsan Peak. One day, a heavenly god commanded peaks of all mountains to assemble at Geumgangsan Mountain to create the greatest scenery. However, the Ulsan Peak was too heavy, so it was late for the meeting. Feeling ashamed, it didn‚Äôt go back home (Ulsan) directly, and took a rest at Seoraksan Mountain, but stayed there forever. Also, there is a saying that the peak was named after the shape of the rock, which resembles a fence (ul+tari) or a crying (ul) mountain (san). Visitors can get to the Ulsan Peak by starting from the small park and passing through Sinheungsa Temple and Heundeul Rock. At the beginning of the path, it starts with a gentle slope, but after the Heundeul Rock, there are a steep rocky hill and the iron stairs. It requires about 4 hr for getting to and from the peak. It is hard for the elderly or children to climb because of high level of difficulty.","regDate":"2022-10-16","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Resources","Rocks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-16-1665913620696/2711195_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-16-1665913620696"},{"id":"2022-10-16-1665910327005","title":"Uisangdae Pavilion (ÎÇôÏÇ∞ÏÇ¨ ÏùòÏÉÅÎåÄ)","description":"This pavilion is located on a seaside cliff on the way from Yangyang‚Äôs Naksansa Temple to Gwaneumgul Cave of Hongnyeonam Hermitage. The word ‚Äúdae‚Äù in Uisangdae refers to a building built at a vantage point for areas with beautiful scenery. Indeed, the view of the East Sea and the coast from Uisangdae Pavilion awarded its recognition as one of the Eight Sights of Yangyang, and a must-visit place for all visitors to Naksansa Temple. Jeong Cheol (pen-name  Songgang), a famed scholar and writer of the poem Song of Diamond Mountains, chose the pavilion as one of the Eight Sights of Gwandong, and the pavilion is today one of the popular sites for sunrise-viewing on the east coast of Korea. Together with Hongnyeonam Hermitage, it is designated as the Scenic Site No. 27 of Korea under the name ‚ÄúUisangdae Pavilion and Hongnyeonam Hermitage of Naksansa Temple, Yangyang.‚Äù Uisangdae is named after Uisang, a respected Silla-era Buddhist monk who is said to have founded this temple in 671 (11th year of King Munmu‚Äôs reign of Silla), and many stories of his deeds can still be found in the temple. For instance, Uisangdae is said to be the site where he meditated before founding Naksansa Temple at its present site.

The entire floor is made of transparent glass, so visitors will feel like walking on the water. When you stand on the skywalk, you will encounter a picturesque view of Samaksan Mountain and Uiamho Lake. Soyanggang Skywalk boasts another splendid scenery of Chuncheon. Although the access from the Kim Youjeong Memorial Stone is close to Uiam Lake Skywalk, parking space is insufficient, thus, it is recommended to use the public parking lot near Chuncheon Songam Sports Town. It takes 15 min by foot or bike along the Uiamho Bike Path from the public parking lot to Uiam Lake Skywalk.
