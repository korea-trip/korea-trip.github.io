The train moves at the speed of 30 km per hour, excluding the Cheoram Route where the train normally slows down to 27.7 km per hour, allowing passengers to have time to enjoy the view outside. To provide clear views of the cliffs and valleys along the ride, a large portion of the train walls, excluding the ceiling, has been made into glass windows.
