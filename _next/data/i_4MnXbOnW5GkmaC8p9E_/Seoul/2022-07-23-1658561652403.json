It is said that Heo Seon-mun, the forefather  of the Yangcheon Heo clan, was born here. The park was built to commemorate Heo Jun, a widely known physician from the Joseon era who used the penname Guam. It is said that after retirement, Heo Jun came to Heogabawi Rock to compile the famous medical book Dongui Bogam. <br><br>\n A part of the Hangang River here was turned into a lake due to the construction of the Olympic Expressway and high-rise apartments surrounding the park. There is a statue of Heo Jun treating a patient \nand in the lake, there is a purple-colored rock with holes called Gwangju Rock. Before the construction of the Yanghwadaegyo Bridge, this area used to be where visitors would take a ferry (Gongam Ferry) to cross the other side. <br><br>\n\nHeogabawi Rock, which is wide enough to accommodate about 20 men, is said to be where people took refuge during wars. Gwangju Rock and Heogabawi Rock is the site of Jechapaeui (the rock where rituals were offered to the God of the Earth and the God of Crops during the Hanseong Baekje period). This was also the first historical name given to this area.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-2-2600-4183|\n|opendate:|October 31, 1993|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Pond, pavilion, children's playground, musical fountain, statue of Heo Jun, etc.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-23-1658561652403/2458992_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658561652403/2458992_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658561652403/2458993_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658561652403/2458993_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658561652403/2458995_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658561652403/2458995_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658561652403/2458996_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658561652403/2458996_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658561652403/2459000_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658561652403/2459000_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658561652403/2459001_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658561652403/2459001_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658561652403/566493_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658561652403/566493_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658561652403/566494_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658561652403/566494_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658561652403/566496_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658561652403/566496_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658561652403/566497_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658561652403/566497_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-2-2600-4183](tel:+82226004183)\n- [üè†parks.seoul.go.kr](http://parks.seoul.go.kr/parks/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5676574399\nlongitude: 126.8537656954\ntitle: 42, Heojun-ro 5-gil, Gangseo-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-23-1658561652403","title":"Guam Park (Íµ¨ÏïîÍ≥µÏõê)","description":"Guam Park is located  in the area around Heogabawi Rock, a  natural rock cave beneath Tapsan Mountain.

When the prison was moved to Uiwang-si, Gyeonggi-do in November 1987, the area was restored and turned into a memorial park in August 15, 1992  to honor the sacrifices of the martyrs. The park preserves seven prison buildings, an execution ground, underground women‚Äôs prison, and the March 1st Movement Monument that has been moved from Tapgol Park in Jongno.<br><br>One of the most significant monuments of the Seodaemun Independence Park is Dongnimmun Gate (Independence Gate), which has been designated a Historic Site. Nearby is Dongnipgwan (Independence Hall), originally called Mohwagwan, which was used to greet Chinese envoys during the Joseon dynasty. Today, the hall enshrines 2,327 tablets inscribed with the names of Koreans who died for the cause of national independence. Standing right next to Dongnimmun Gate are the remnants of Yeongeunmun Gate, another Historic Site. Other sights inside the park include the Patriotic Martyr Monument, Declaration of Independence Monument, and Statue of Dr. Seo Jae-pil, who was an independence activist and publisher of Korea‚Äôs first independent newspaper.
