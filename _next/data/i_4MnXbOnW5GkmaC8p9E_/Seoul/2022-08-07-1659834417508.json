The sand was used to create what seems like an island floating in the middle of the Hangang River. Nodeulseom Island was left abandoned for the next 50 years until 2005, when the Seoul Metropolitan Government purchased the property. After a series of planning and changes, the island was open to the public in 2019 as a recreational area while preserving most of its original form. Nodeulseom Isand's main attractions consist of a live house, bookstore, music lounges, garden, and more, serving as a cultural entertainment spot to the public.&nbsp;<br>\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-2-749-4500|\n|opendate:|2019ÎÖÑ 09Ïõî 28Ïùº|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|Mondays, New Year's Day, & the day of Seollal (Korean New Year's Day) and Chuseok (Korean Thanksgiving Day)|\n|usetime:|[Outdoors] Open 24 hr<br> [Indoor facilities] 09:00-21:30<br> [Cultural facilities] 12:00-20:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Shopping Information:|Souvenir shop, bookstore, restaurants, cafes, etc.|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Activity Fees:|Varies by program<br>* Refer to the official website and social media channel|\n|Facility Utilization Fees:|Varies by facility<br>* Refer to the official website|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638956_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638956_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638960_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638960_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638963_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638963_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638966_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638966_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638967_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638967_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638968_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638968_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638970_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638970_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638976_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638976_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638980_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638980_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638958_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-07-1659834417508/2638958_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-2-749-4500](tel:+8227494500)\n- [üè†nodeul.org ](http://nodeul.org/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5177234407\nlongitude: 126.9580659298\ntitle: 445, Yangnyeong-ro, Yongsan-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-07-1659834417508","title":"Nodeulseom Island (ÎÖ∏Îì§ÏÑ¨)","description":"Originally called Jungjido Island until the 1950s, Nodeulseom Island was a sandy plain used for recreational purposes until the areas of Hangang River underwent development in the '60s and '70s.

It was used to imprison thousands of Korean independence activists until the liberation from the Japanese occupation on August 15, 1945, as well as the political prisoners during the political turmoil in the 1960s. When the prison was moved to Uiwang-si, Gyeonggi-do in November 1987, the area was restored and turned into a memorial park in August 15, 1992  to honor the sacrifices of the martyrs. The park preserves seven prison buildings, an execution ground, underground women‚Äôs prison, and the March 1st Movement Monument that has been moved from Tapgol Park in Jongno.<br><br>One of the most significant monuments of the Seodaemun Independence Park is Dongnimmun Gate (Independence Gate), which has been designated a Historic Site. Nearby is Dongnipgwan (Independence Hall), originally called Mohwagwan, which was used to greet Chinese envoys during the Joseon dynasty. Today, the hall enshrines 2,327 tablets inscribed with the names of Koreans who died for the cause of national independence. Standing right next to Dongnimmun Gate are the remnants of Yeongeunmun Gate, another Historic Site. Other sights inside the park include the Patriotic Martyr Monument, Declaration of Independence Monument, and Statue of Dr. Seo Jae-pil, who was an independence activist and publisher of Korea‚Äôs first independent newspaper.
