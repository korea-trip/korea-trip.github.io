{"pageProps":{"content":"![Baek In-je House (Î∞±Ïù∏Ï†úÍ∞ÄÏò•)](/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481892_image2_1.webp)\n  \n## Overview\n\n> Baek In-je House in Gahoe-dong, located in Bukchon Hanok Village, is a hanok built during the Japanese administration period that portrays modern hanok features. The structure consists of a main room offering a good view of the whole village, spacious bedrooms, a large garden, and annex buildings. As it withholds the beauty of a traditional hanok while incorporating the modern trend of its time, Baek In-je House is considered to be highly valuable in means of both architecture and history, representing the Bukchon Hanok Village together with Yun Bo-seon House.<br /><br />Baek In-je House was built from black pine, which was first introduced in Seoul during the Gyeongseong Expo in 1907, distinguishing itself from other upper-class houses of its time. Unlike other traditional hanok designs that separate the main building from the other rooms, Baek In-je House connects the two with a hallway, allowing convenient access between the two structures. The house also consists of a Japanese-style hallway and floor mat rooms, reflecting the interior trends of that period. Baek In-je House is also unique in that the main room is partially built as a two-story structure, a style that was never seen in any traditional hanok built during the Joseon period.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|accomcount:|100 people|\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-2-724-0200|\n|restdate:|Mondays (open in the case of Monday is a public holiday), New Year's Day|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00 (Last admission 17:30)<br />* Outdoor facility accessible during free viewing time <br />* Indoor areas off limits|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Reservation & on-site registration available for guided tours<br> Schedule: 16:00 (Wednesdays - Japanese / Thursdays - Chinese / Fridays - English)<br><br> * Elementary students and younger children must be accompanied by an adult.<br>* Call +82-2-724-0232 for cancellations. <br>* Reservation canceled if more than 10 min late|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481870_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481870_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481871_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481871_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481872_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481872_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481874_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481874_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481877_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481877_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481878_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481878_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481879_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481879_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481880_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481880_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481890_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481890_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-2-724-0200](tel:+8227240200)\n- [üè†www.museum.seoul.kr](http://www.museum.seoul.kr/www/intro/annexIntro/annex_22/annex_22_01.jsp?sso=ok)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5804416194\nlongitude: 126.9840701194\ntitle: 16, Bukchon-ro 7-gil, Jongno-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-11-1657507335227","title":"Baek In-je House (Î∞±Ïù∏Ï†úÍ∞ÄÏò•)","description":"Baek In-je House in Gahoe-dong, located in Bukchon Hanok Village, is a hanok built during the Japanese administration period that portrays modern hanok features.

It was used to imprison thousands of Korean independence activists until the liberation from the Japanese occupation on August 15, 1945, as well as the political prisoners during the political turmoil in the 1960s. When the prison was moved to Uiwang-si, Gyeonggi-do in November 1987, the area was restored and turned into a memorial park in August 15, 1992  to honor the sacrifices of the martyrs. The park preserves seven prison buildings, an execution ground, underground women‚Äôs prison, and the March 1st Movement Monument that has been moved from Tapgol Park in Jongno.<br><br>One of the most significant monuments of the Seodaemun Independence Park is Dongnimmun Gate (Independence Gate), which has been designated a Historic Site. Nearby is Dongnipgwan (Independence Hall), originally called Mohwagwan, which was used to greet Chinese envoys during the Joseon dynasty. Today, the hall enshrines 2,327 tablets inscribed with the names of Koreans who died for the cause of national independence. Standing right next to Dongnimmun Gate are the remnants of Yeongeunmun Gate, another Historic Site. Other sights inside the park include the Patriotic Martyr Monument, Declaration of Independence Monument, and Statue of Dr. Seo Jae-pil, who was an independence activist and publisher of Korea‚Äôs first independent newspaper. The main highlight of the park is the Seodaemun Prison History Hall, a former prison building that was renovated into a history museum.","regDate":"2022-08-08","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Theme Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-08-1659948369513/2413903_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-08-08-1659948369513"},{"id":"2022-08-08-1659944224530","title":"Seochon Village (ÏÑúÏ¥åÎßàÏùÑ)","description":"Seochon Village, literally meaning west village, is named in reference to its location west of Gyeongbokgung Palace.
