The legacy of the 1988 Seoul Olympics, the park not only houses the country‚Äôs largest sports arena, but has also become a place where Seoul residents come to relax and unwind. \n<br><br>\nSpread across approximately 1.45 million square meters, Olympic Park encompasses the land that was once Mongchontoseong Fortress and Mongchonhaeja (manmade lake) from the early Baekje period. The park is divided into several zones, including a leisure sports park, a cultural art park, an eco-park, and the History Experience Park dedicated to the area‚Äôs rich historic heritage. \n<br><br>\nBecause Olympic Park is so large and takes over three hours to explore, visitors are advised to familiarize themselves with entrances and exits and travel routes before they start. To further save time, visitors can ride the Road Train (‚ÄúHodori Train‚Äù) located next to Peace Square.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-2-410-1114|\n|opendate:|April 1986|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Pedestrian and bicycle access: 05:00‚Äì22:00 (Plaza area until 24:00)<br>Vehicle access: 06:00-22:00<br>* Prohibited from entering park except for Peace Square and Meeting Square after 22:00 for safety|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Parking Fees:|Small vehicles: 1,000 won within one hour / 500 won for each additional 15 minute<br> Large vehicles (24 passengers / 2.5 tons of more): 12,000 won<br> * Light-weighted vehicles, cars for people with disabilities, etc.: 50% discount<br> * In the event of large event held in the park, parking fees are changed to pre-paid parking lot and the parking lot operating hour is subject to change. <br>(Pre-paid parking lot: Small vehicles 5,000 won / Large vehicles 12,000 won)|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-07-1659834580035/722873_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-07-1659834580035/722873_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-07-1659834580035/1567821_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-07-1659834580035/1567821_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-07-1659834580035/1567822_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-07-1659834580035/1567822_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-07-1659834580035/1567823_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-07-1659834580035/1567823_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-07-1659834580035/1567824_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-07-1659834580035/1567824_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-07-1659834580035/1567826_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-07-1659834580035/1567826_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-07-1659834580035/1567827_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-07-1659834580035/1567827_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-07-1659834580035/2650437_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-07-1659834580035/2650437_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-2-410-1114](tel:+8224101114)\n- [üè†www.olympicpark.co.kr](http://www.olympicpark.co.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5194456386\nlongitude: 127.1224425827\ntitle: 424, Olympic-ro, Songpa-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway] <br>\nOlympic Park Station (Seoul Subway Line 5), Exit 3.<br>\n Mongchontoseong Station (Seoul Subway Line 8), Exit 1.<br>\n<br>\n [Bus]<br>\n Get off at Olympic Park Bus Stop.<br>\n - Green Bus: 3214, 3220, 3319, 3412<br>\n<br>\n Get off at Olympic Park Peace Plaza Bus Stop.<br>\n - Green Bus: 3412, 3413<br>\n - Blue Bus: 340<br>\n<br>\n Get off at Olympic Center Bus Stop.<br>\n - Green Bus: 3318, 3319, 3411, 4318<br> - Blue Bus: 340, 341, 351\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-07-1659834580035","title":"Olympic Park (Ïò¨Î¶ºÌîΩÍ≥µÏõê)","description":"Olympic Park is an impressive leisure facility in which historic remains from the Baekje era share space with modern, state-of-the-art sports stadiums, an eco-friendly forest, and spacious grass fields.

It was used to imprison thousands of Korean independence activists until the liberation from the Japanese occupation on August 15, 1945, as well as the political prisoners during the political turmoil in the 1960s. When the prison was moved to Uiwang-si, Gyeonggi-do in November 1987, the area was restored and turned into a memorial park in August 15, 1992  to honor the sacrifices of the martyrs. The park preserves seven prison buildings, an execution ground, underground women‚Äôs prison, and the March 1st Movement Monument that has been moved from Tapgol Park in Jongno.<br><br>One of the most significant monuments of the Seodaemun Independence Park is Dongnimmun Gate (Independence Gate), which has been designated a Historic Site. Nearby is Dongnipgwan (Independence Hall), originally called Mohwagwan, which was used to greet Chinese envoys during the Joseon dynasty. Today, the hall enshrines 2,327 tablets inscribed with the names of Koreans who died for the cause of national independence. Standing right next to Dongnimmun Gate are the remnants of Yeongeunmun Gate, another Historic Site. Other sights inside the park include the Patriotic Martyr Monument, Declaration of Independence Monument, and Statue of Dr. Seo Jae-pil, who was an independence activist and publisher of Korea‚Äôs first independent newspaper.
