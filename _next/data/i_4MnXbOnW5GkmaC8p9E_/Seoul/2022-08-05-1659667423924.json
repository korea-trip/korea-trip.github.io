The park preserves seven prison buildings, an execution ground, underground women’s prison, and the March 1st Movement Monument that has been moved from Tapgol Park in Jongno.<br><br>One of the most significant monuments of the Seodaemun Independence Park is Dongnimmun Gate (Independence Gate), which has been designated a Historic Site. Nearby is Dongnipgwan (Independence Hall), originally called Mohwagwan, which was used to greet Chinese envoys during the Joseon dynasty. Today, the hall enshrines 2,327 tablets inscribed with the names of Koreans who died for the cause of national independence. Standing right next to Dongnimmun Gate are the remnants of Yeongeunmun Gate, another Historic Site. Other sights inside the park include the Patriotic Martyr Monument, Declaration of Independence Monument, and Statue of Dr. Seo Jae-pil, who was an independence activist and publisher of Korea’s first independent newspaper.
