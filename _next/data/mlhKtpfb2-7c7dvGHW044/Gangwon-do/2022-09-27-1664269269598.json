The area is an important geology and topography learning site where it is visible to see the topography before the formation of the basalt lava field and the fact that the basalt lava flowed over the bedrock to form the lava field. Goseok is a bedrock that existed before the area of Cheorwon was covered with lava, and is a granite formed underground about 110 million years ago (mid Cretaceous period).
