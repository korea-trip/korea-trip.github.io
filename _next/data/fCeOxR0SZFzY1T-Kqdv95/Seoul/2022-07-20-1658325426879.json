The structure consists of a main room offering a good view of the whole village, spacious bedrooms, a large garden, and annex buildings. As it withholds the beauty of a traditional hanok while incorporating the modern trend of its time, Baek In-je House is considered to be highly valuable in means of both architecture and history, representing the Bukchon Hanok Village together with Yun Bo-seon House.<br /><br />Baek In-je House was built from black pine, which was first introduced in Seoul during the Gyeongseong Expo in 1907, distinguishing itself from other upper-class houses of its time. Unlike other traditional hanok designs that separate the main building from the other rooms, Baek In-je House connects the two with a hallway, allowing convenient access between the two structures. The house also consists of a Japanese-style hallway and floor mat rooms, reflecting the interior trends of that period. Baek In-je House is also unique in that the main room is partially built as a two-story structure, a style that was never seen in any traditional hanok built during the Joseon period.","regDate":"2022-07-11","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Old Houses"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481892_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-07-11-1657507335227","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Seoul/2022-07-11-1657507335227"},{"id":"2022-07-11-1657494251347","title":"Aqua Planet 63 (ÏïÑÏø†ÏïÑÌîåÎùºÎÑ∑ 63)","description":"Aqua Planet 63 located in 63 Square was opened on July 1, 2016.
