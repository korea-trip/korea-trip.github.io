The rock blended with a giant surrounding rocky wall creates a mysterious atmosphere. When it rains, water flows down through the rock and forms a small waterfall. The stream of water winding around the rock is considered the magnificent view, which is similar to that of the Manpokdong Valley in Geumgangsan Mountain. When the season changes, its landscape boasts different scenery  full-blown flowers in spring, green and refreshing trees in summer, colorful autumnal leaves in autumn, and white snowy view in winter. Due to such a mysterious landscape, Biseondae Rock bears a legend in which Taoist hermit called Magoseon enjoyed scenery of this place and ascended to heaven. The name of Biseondae, meaning the rock (dae) where a Taoist hermit (seon) flew up (bi) to the sky, originates from this legend.","regDate":"2022-10-21","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Resources","Rocks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-21-1666345971150/650537_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-21-1666345971150"},{"id":"2022-10-21-1666342637738","title":"Biryongpokpo Falls (ÎπÑÎ£°Ìè≠Ìè¨)","description":"Biryongpokpo Falls is 2.4 km away in the south from the Seoraksan Small Park ticket booth. Biryongpokpo Falls is located between Towangseong Falls in the upper region and Yukdam Falls in the lower region. Biryongpokpo Falls was named after the shape of the water stream of the falls (pokpo) resembling a dragon (ryong) ascending (bi) to heaven. Their powerful water streams pouring into the narrow and rough valley look like a legendary dragon. There is another tale associated with Biryongpokpo Falls. A dragon lived here, and one day villagers offered a maiden to the dragon to break the drought. Then, the dragon flew up to the sky, and there were no more droughts in the village. The waterfalls drop 16 m to the ground and their loud sound resonates in the valley. In winter, the waterfalls freeze and the frozen water columns offer another magnificent view. A clear pond is formed beneath the falls and around which there is a wooden observation deck. Biryongpokpo Falls and Surroundings in Seoraksan Mountain were designated as the Scenic Site No. 95. It takes about 1 hr from the Small Park to the Biryongpokpo Falls, while it takes about 3 hr (round-trip) to visit up to Towangseong Falls and Yukdam Falls. The difficulty level of this tour course is ordinary.","regDate":"2022-10-21","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Waterfalls"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-21-1666342637738"},{"id":"2022-10-21-1666338656222","title":"Baengnyongdonggul Cave-Gangwon Paleozoic Geopark (Î∞±Î£°ÎèôÍµ¥-Í∞ïÏõêÍ≥†ÏÉùÎåÄ Íµ≠Í∞ÄÏßÄÏßàÍ≥µÏõê)","description":"Baengnyongdonggul Cave is a 1.8„éû-long, natural limestone cave located in Pyeongchang-gun, Gangwon-do.
