The beach is 1 kilometer in length and 200 meters in x_width, and has the shape of a half moon. Around 200 pine trees encompass the area and form a dense cozy forest. The water is only about 1 to 2 meters deep and its clear waters make it one of the three best beaches in the southwestern part of Korea. <br>Small islands dot the sea in front of the beach and the view of the fishing boats drifting by is very peaceful. The sunset on the west gives off a different vibe from the sunrise of the east. Near the beach area is a coastal drive way with a wonderful view of the coast. Dombaeseom Island, famous for ocean fishing, and Chilsando Island are lined up more or less in a row.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-61-356-1020|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Pavilion, shower booths, camping site, water fountain, accommodations, restaurants, etc. |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-19-1674103234512/189660_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-19-1674103234512/189660_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-19-1674103234512/583932_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-19-1674103234512/583932_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-19-1674103234512/583933_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-19-1674103234512/583933_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-19-1674103234512/583994_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-19-1674103234512/583994_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-19-1674103234512/635717_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-19-1674103234512/635717_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-19-1674103234512/635723_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-19-1674103234512/635723_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-19-1674103234512/635727_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-19-1674103234512/635727_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-19-1674103234512/635732_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-19-1674103234512/635732_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-19-1674103234512/635742_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-19-1674103234512/635742_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-19-1674103234512/583995_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-19-1674103234512/583995_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-61-356-1020](tel:+82613561020)\n- [🏠yeonggwang.go.kr](http://tour.yeonggwang.go.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.3997293920\nlongitude: 126.4090769892\ntitle: 355, Gamami-ro, Yeonggwang-gun, Jeollanam-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-19-1674103234512","title":"Gamami Beach (가마미해수욕장)","description":"Located 24 kilometers west of Yeonggwang-eup, Gamami Beach was first opened in 1925.
