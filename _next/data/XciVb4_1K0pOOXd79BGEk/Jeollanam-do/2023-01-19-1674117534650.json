It is also home to beautiful mountains, rivers, and plains that add to its scenic beauty and natural features. The Baengnyeonsa Temple and Dasan Chodang to the west of Gangjinman Bay, and the reeds along the coastline are a beautiful sight to behold. Also, the National Highway No. 23 that runs along the eastern border of the Gangjinman Bay, past the town of Gangjin-eup to Maryang, is famous for its many spectacular sights. Above all, it is highly recommended to hike up the Cheonilgak Pavilion in front of the Dasan Chodong Dongam (east hermitage) for a panoramic view of Gugangpo’s coastal waters. The hiking trail that traverses Mandeoksan Mountain leads to Baengnyeonsa, which is a temple with breathtaking ocean view.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Korea Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <BR>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-61-430-3114|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-19-1674117534650/220620_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-19-1674117534650/220620_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-19-1674117534650/220621_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-19-1674117534650/220621_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-19-1674117534650/220622_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-19-1674117534650/220622_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-19-1674117534650/974948_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-19-1674117534650/974948_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-19-1674117534650/974949_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-19-1674117534650/974949_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-19-1674117534650/974962_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-19-1674117534650/974962_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-19-1674117534650/974968_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-19-1674117534650/974968_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-61-430-3114](tel:+82614303114)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 34.5952233820\nlongitude: 126.7701508920\ntitle: Beoljeong-ri, Gangjin-gun, Jeollanam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[BUs]<BR>\nFrom Seoul Central City Bus Terminal, take an intercity bus to Gangjin Bus Terminal.<br>\nFrom Gangjin Bus Terminal, take a local bus bound for Maryang.\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-19-1674117534650","title":"Gangjinman Bay (강진만)","description":"Gangjin has many scenic landscapes with Wolchulsan Mountain to the north and the sea of Gugangpo dotted with numerous islets and wetlands to the south.
