There are 735 traditional Korean hanok houses. While the rest of the city has been industrialized, Hanok Village retains its historical charms and traditions. <br /><br />The charm of Jeonju Hanok Village lies in the hanok buildings unique roof edges, which are slightly raised to the sky. Hanok houses are generally divided into two sections, <em>anchae</em> and <em>sarangchae</em>. Sarangchae is where the men dwell. Because men and women had to remain separated, anchae is situated deep inside the house so that it is secretive and quiet. <br /><br />Another trait of hanok is that all the houses are heated with ondol, a unique floor heating system. Since Koreans enjoy sitting, eating, and sleeping on the floor, it needs to remain heated in winter. To experience what hanok is like, visitors can either book a hanok accommodation or visit the Hanok Life Experience Hall.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-63-282-1330|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Available Facilities:|[Cultural facilities]<br>Jeonju Craft Exhibition, Jeonju Sori Arts Center, Jeonju Fan Museum, etc.<br><br>[Cultural heritages]<br>Gyeonggijeon Shrine, Portrait of King Taejo, Jeondong Cathedral, Jeonjuhyanggo Local Confucian School, etc.<br><br>[Unique attractions]<br>Jaman Mural Village, Nambu Night Market, Jeonju Nanjang, etc.|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-04-1672824967328/2674220_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-04-1672824967328/2674220_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-04-1672824967328/2674221_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-04-1672824967328/2674221_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-04-1672824967328/2674222_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-04-1672824967328/2674222_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-04-1672824967328/2674223_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-04-1672824967328/2674223_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-63-282-1330](tel:+82632821330)\n- [üè†hanok.jeonju.go.kr](http://hanok.jeonju.go.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.8183333748\nlongitude: 127.1536778411\ntitle: 99, Girin-daero, Wansan-gu, Jeonju-si, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-04-1672824967328","title":"Jeonju Hanok Village [Slow City] (Ï†ÑÎ∂Å Ï†ÑÏ£º ÌïúÏò•ÎßàÏùÑ [Ïä¨Î°úÏãúÌã∞])","description":"Jeonju Hanok Village is located in the city of Jeonju and overlaps Pungnam-dong and Gyo-dong.

According to Samgukyusa (historical records published in 1281), King Mu (30th king of Baekje, in power AD 600-641) and his wife Queen Seonhwa were said to have seen a vision of Mireuksamjon (the three Sanskrit) emerging from a large pond. At the time of their revelation, the king and queen were on their way to visit a Buddhist monk in Sajasa Temple on Yonghwasan Mountain (now known as Mireuksan Mountain). In response to their vision, the king drained the nearby pond and established Mireuksa Temple. The temple is believed to have shown the most advanced architectural and cultural skills of Baekje, Silla, and Goguryeo (the three main kingdoms at that time). Records indicate that King Jinpyeong of Silla even sent his craftsmen over to assist with the temple construction. <br><br>The two main features of the Mireuksa Temple Site are the stone pagoda (Mireuksaji Seoktap) and the flagpole supports (Mireuksaji Dangganjiju). The 14.24-meter-high west stone pagoda (National Treasure No. 11) is the oldest and largest Korean stone pagoda in existence. The west pagoda currently has only six tiers, but is estimated to originally have had nine. The nine-story east stone pagoda (27.67 meters in x_height) was restored to its original stature in 1993 based on historical records. Other surviving landmarks include the flagpole supports (Treasure No. 236) to the south of the stone pagodas. The 395 centimeter-tall poles are estimated to have been created during the Unified Silla period (AD 676-935) and are set 90 meters apart from east to west.","regDate":"2023-01-06","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-06-1672983362269/2514985_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-06-1672983362269"},{"id":"2023-01-06-1672979958647","title":"Manghaesa Temple (ÎßùÌï¥ÏÇ¨)","description":"Manghaesa Temple is located at the edge of the Gimje Plains before the sea. The temple stands at the summit of Jinbongsan Mountain.  The temple was named for the view of the ocean and the fields of rice. The temple was established by the great monk Buseol Geosa during the 2nd year of King Uija of Baekje (AD 642). Years later, Dobeopsa (a Chinese monk from the Tang dynasty) renovated the temple. The temple was altered again during the reign of King Injo of the Joseon dynasty when the great monk Jinmuk Daesa built Nakseojeon Hall in 1589. Bogwangjeon Hall and Chilseonggak Pavilion were built much later in 1933. Manghaesa Temple is unique in that it is the only temple where the distant horizon is visible over both land and sea. Nearby attractions include a walking path through a field of reeds by Mangyeonggang River and views of the sunset over the sea.","regDate":"2023-01-06","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-06-1672979958647/2675611_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-06-1672979958647"},{"id":"2023-01-06-1672976184633","title":"Maisan Hwaeomgul Cave (ÎßàÏù¥ÏÇ∞ ÌôîÏóÑÍµ¥)","description":"Maisan Mountain has two major peaks made of sedimentary rocks; these peaks are said to be ‚Äòcouple peaks‚Äô and cannot be found anywhere else. Sut Maibong (alt. 667 meters) is said to be the male peak while the slightly larger Am Maibong (alt. 673 meters) is deemed the female peak. In the early Joseon period the mountain was named ‚ÄòSokgeumsan,‚Äô but began to be called ‚ÄòMaisan‚Äô after the 12th year of King Taejong, who commented that the two peaks resembled horse ears (‚Äòmaisan‚Äô meaning ‚Äòhorse ears‚Äô). All along Maisan Mountain, visitors will find small crater-like rock cavities that are formed by prolonged weathering. These unique geological features, called ‚Äòtafoni,‚Äô are of great academic value. <br><br>Inside Hwaeomgul Cave, visitors can observe medicinal water that flows up from underground all throughout the year. It is widely believed that once you drink the water, especially on the days of the Spring and Autumn Equinox, you will soon have a son and be blessed by the mountain spirit. Even today, many women who have difficulty conceiving visit the mountain to pray to the mountain spirits for their heart‚Äôs desire‚Äîthe gift of a child. The region in which Maisan is located is the birthplace of many talented people and national heroes, which some say is proof of the blessings of the mountain and its extremely powerful spirit.","regDate":"2023-01-06","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-06-1672976184633/198644_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-06-1672976184633"},{"id":"2023-01-05-1672915064725","title":"Korea Expressway Corporation Arboretum (Jeonju Arboretum) (ÌïúÍµ≠ÎèÑÎ°úÍ≥µÏÇ¨ÏàòÎ™©Ïõê(Ï†ÑÏ£ºÏàòÎ™©Ïõê))","description":"Korea Expressway Corporation Arboretum (Jeonju Arboretum) is located in a relatively warm region of the country, reaching 20-30 meters in altitude.
