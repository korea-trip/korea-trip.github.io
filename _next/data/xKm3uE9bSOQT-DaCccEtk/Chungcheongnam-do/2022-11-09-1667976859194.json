Compared with other Korean fortresses, Imjonseong Fortress is higher and about 2 meters thicker. It is the largest fortress of the Baekje Kingdom and has become the subject of much research.<br><br>History shows that the fortress was the central hub of the Restoration Movement of the Baekje Kingdom (18 BC - 660 AD). In the 20th year of the reign of King Uija (Baekje dynasty), the kingdom was defeated by the united forces of the Silla Kingdom and the Tang dynasty (currently, China). Boksin (a cousin of King Uisa), a monk, and Heukchisangji stayed at the fortress for three years while trying to return the king to power.<br><br>As you walk along the winding trail, you’ll be able to see Daeryeonsa Temple and as you continue to the top, you’ll be treated to spectacular views of Oseosan, Baekwolsan, and Gayasan mountains.

At low tide, Ganworam Hermitage is connected to shore via a natural walkway, but at high tide, the walkway is submerged and the hermitage becomes an island. At night time, in particular, the hermitage and its surrounding islets create a breathtaking view as the moonlight reflects off the sea.","regDate":"2022-11-21","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-21-1669013187316/681511_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Chungcheongnam-do/2022-11-21-1669013187316"},{"id":"2022-11-21-1669006111919","title":"Seocheon Dalgogae Mosi Village (서천 달고개모시마을)","description":"In Seocheon Dalgogae Mosi Village, the long-standing tradition of Hansan mosi (ramie fabric) is passed down and preserved in the hands of the village women.
