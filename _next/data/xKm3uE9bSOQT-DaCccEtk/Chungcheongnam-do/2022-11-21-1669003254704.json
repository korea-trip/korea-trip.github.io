Ganworam Hermitage was created by the Great Monk Muhak, the monk to King Taejo of the Joseon dynasty. The name of the hermitage is directly tied with Muhak himself as it is said Muhak became enlightened while meditating under the moon (“wol” means moon in Korean) at this hermitage. At low tide, Ganworam Hermitage is connected to shore via a natural walkway, but at high tide, the walkway is submerged and the hermitage becomes an island. At night time, in particular, the hermitage and its surrounding islets create a breathtaking view as the moonlight reflects off the sea.","regDate":"2022-11-21","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-21-1669013187316/681511_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Chungcheongnam-do/2022-11-21-1669013187316"},{"id":"2022-11-21-1669006111919","title":"Seocheon Dalgogae Mosi Village (서천 달고개모시마을)","description":"In Seocheon Dalgogae Mosi Village, the long-standing tradition of Hansan mosi (ramie fabric) is passed down and preserved in the hands of the village women.
