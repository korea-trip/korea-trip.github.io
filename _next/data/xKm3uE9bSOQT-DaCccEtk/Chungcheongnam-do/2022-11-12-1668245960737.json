The lush forest covers an area of 8,265 ㎡ with the trees being nearly 500 years old. The best time to enjoy the camellias is from late March to early May. Dongbaekjeong Pavilion at the peak of the hill offers a beautiful view of the nearby Oryeokdo Island in the blue sea and is also a prime spot for taking in the sunset. <br><br>The western side of the forest has few remaining trees, but the eastern side is still lush with over 70 trees. While camellia trees typically grow to be 7 meters tall, the strong sea breeze has caused the trees in this forest to have a stunted growth of just 2 meters, as well as growing at a slant.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-41-952-7999|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|January 1, the day of Seolllal (Lunar New Year’s Day) & Chuseok (Korean Thanksgiving Day)|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00 (Winter season 09:00-17:00)<br>* Last admission 30 min before closing|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 1,000 won / Teenagers 700 won / Children 500 won<br>Groups - Adults 800 won / Teenagers 500 won / Children 400 won<br><br>* Groups: 30 people or more<br>* Free admission: Preschoolers (ages 6 & younger), senior citizens (ages 65 & older)|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Dongbaekjeong Pavilion, Maryangdangjip House, drinking fountain, etc.|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-12-1668245960737/2026502_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-12-1668245960737/2026502_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-12-1668245960737/2026503_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-12-1668245960737/2026503_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-12-1668245960737/2026504_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-12-1668245960737/2026504_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-12-1668245960737/2482719_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-12-1668245960737/2482719_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-41-952-7999](tel:+82419527999)\n- [🏠www.seocheon.go.kr](http://www.seocheon.go.kr/tour/sub01_01_01.do)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.1379050125\nlongitude: 126.4935201987\ntitle: 103, Seoin-ro 235beon-gil, Seocheon-gun, Chungcheongnam-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-12-1668245960737","title":"Seocheon Maryang-ri Camellia Forest (서천 마량리 동백나무 숲)","description":"One of the eight scenic views of Seocheon, Maryang-ri Camellia Forest is designated as Natural Monument No. 169.

At low tide, Ganworam Hermitage is connected to shore via a natural walkway, but at high tide, the walkway is submerged and the hermitage becomes an island. At night time, in particular, the hermitage and its surrounding islets create a breathtaking view as the moonlight reflects off the sea.","regDate":"2022-11-21","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-21-1669013187316/681511_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Chungcheongnam-do/2022-11-21-1669013187316"},{"id":"2022-11-21-1669006111919","title":"Seocheon Dalgogae Mosi Village (서천 달고개모시마을)","description":"In Seocheon Dalgogae Mosi Village, the long-standing tradition of Hansan mosi (ramie fabric) is passed down and preserved in the hands of the village women.
