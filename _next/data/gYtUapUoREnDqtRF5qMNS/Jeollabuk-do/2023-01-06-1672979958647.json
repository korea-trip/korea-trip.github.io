{"pageProps":{"content":"![Manghaesa Temple (ÎßùÌï¥ÏÇ¨)](/2023-01-06-1672979958647/2675611_image2_1.webp)\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> Manghaesa Temple is located at the edge of the Gimje Plains before the sea. The temple stands at the summit of Jinbongsan Mountain.  The temple was named for the view of the ocean and the fields of rice. The temple was established by the great monk Buseol Geosa during the 2nd year of King Uija of Baekje (AD 642). Years later, Dobeopsa (a Chinese monk from the Tang dynasty) renovated the temple. The temple was altered again during the reign of King Injo of the Joseon dynasty when the great monk Jinmuk Daesa built Nakseojeon Hall in 1589. Bogwangjeon Hall and Chilseonggak Pavilion were built much later in 1933. Manghaesa Temple is unique in that it is the only temple where the distant horizon is visible over both land and sea. Nearby attractions include a walking path through a field of reeds by Mangyeonggang River and views of the sunset over the sea.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-63-540-3324|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|[Temple grounds] 05:00 - Sunset<br>[Observatory & Walking trail] Open 24 hr|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Not available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-06-1672979958647/176749_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-06-1672979958647/176749_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-06-1672979958647/1603990_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-06-1672979958647/1603990_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-06-1672979958647/1603991_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-06-1672979958647/1603991_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-06-1672979958647/1603993_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-06-1672979958647/1603993_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-06-1672979958647/1603995_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-06-1672979958647/1603995_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-06-1672979958647/2675608_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-06-1672979958647/2675608_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-06-1672979958647/2675610_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-06-1672979958647/2675610_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-63-540-3324](tel:+82635403324)\n- [üè†http://www.gimje.go.kr/tour/board/view.gimje?boardId=BBS_0000080&menuCd=DOM_000000403003000000&paging=ok&startPage=1&searchType=DATA_TITLE&searchOperation=AND&keyword=%EB%A7%9D%ED%95%B4%EC%82%AC&dataSid=120428](http://www.gimje.go.kr/tour/board/view.gimje?boardId=BBS_0000080&menuCd=DOM_000000403003000000&paging=ok&startPage=1&searchType=DATA_TITLE&searchOperation=AND&keyword=%EB%A7%9D%ED%95%B4%EC%82%AC&dataSid=120428)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.8597239049\nlongitude: 126.7156797015\ntitle: 94, Simpo 10-gil, Gimje-si, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>\nFrom Gimje Bus Terminal, take Bus No. 18, 19, or 19-1 bound for Simpo or Geojeon-ri and get off at Manghaesa Temple Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-06-1672979958647","title":"Manghaesa Temple (ÎßùÌï¥ÏÇ¨)","description":"Manghaesa Temple is located at the edge of the Gimje Plains before the sea.

The valley is also befittingly named Baniram since it is so deep that it only receives direct sunlight for half the day. There are many strangely-shaped rocks like Jjokduri Rock, Cheollyeop Rock, and Daebul Rock scattered throughout the lush valley. At the peak of summer, the area is crowded with vacationers and is also popular for its autumn leaves.","regDate":"2023-01-10","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Valleys"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-10-1673332804228/219600_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-10-1673332804228"},{"id":"2023-01-10-1673328964294","title":"Uhwajeong Pavilion (Ïö∞ÌôîÏ†ï(ÎÇ¥Ïû•ÏÇ∞))","description":"Uhwajeong Pavilion takes its name from the legend that the pavilion once grew wings and ascended into the heavens.

Tapsa Temple is famous for the over 80 stone pagodas built by Lee Gapyong, a retired scholar. Those stone pagodas have different sizes and shapes from cone-shaped to straight-shaped. Behind Daeungjeon, Cheonjitap tower is located. It is the largest tower, with a x_height 3 times as high as the average adult‚Äôs x_height. How this tall tower was built is still unclear, drawing much attention from people. It is said that those stone pagodas were made in the late 1800s entirely by Lee Gapyong alone. He collected stones in daytime and built the pagodas at night. Even though the pagodas have been around for more than 100 years, they have never collapsed nor even moved through strong winds, making them truly amazing.<br>Tapsa Temple is also well known for cherry blossoms in spring, covering an area of 1.9km from Nambu (south) parking lot of Maisan Mountain to the entrance (a 30min walk). This road is the venue for Maisan Cherry Blossom Festival as well. <br><br>* Cheonjitap is comprised of two twin pagodas with x_heights of 13.5m and placed in the south and north directions. Cheonjitap is the main pagoda, making the other pagodas at Tapsa Temple look well-balanced. It is believed that 120 towers originally existed, but only 80 of them remain today. The two towers at the very front are named Ilgwangtap and Wolgwangtap. These groups of towers are strong enough to stand up to typhoon winds, something quite hard to believe, giving the towers a certain mystery. Also, towers are tilted slightly in both directions, showing that Lee Gapyong erected the towers with the direction of the wind in mind.","regDate":"2023-01-10","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-10-1673325568605/1605767_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-10-1673325568605"},{"id":"2023-01-10-1673321782101","title":"Taekwondowon Observatory (ÌÉúÍ∂åÎèÑÍ≥µÏõê Ï†ÑÎßùÎåÄ)","description":"Taekwondowon located in Muju-gun, Jeollabuk-do, serves as a main center for the 60 million taekwondo practitioners in 182 countries worldwide.
