Because of its outstanding beauty, Governor Jeong In-ji gave the garden the name ‚ÄòGwanghallu‚Äô in 1444, comparing it to a garden from the palace on the moon. It is famous as the location where Lee Mong-ryong and Chunhyang (two lovers from a well-known Korean folk story) first met. In the 1920‚Äôs Chunhyangsa Temple was established in the neighboring area and a portrait of Chunhyang was hung in a place of honor. The garden is the venue of the Chunhyangjae Festival every spring, celebrating the deep and lasting love of the famous couple. The area around Gwanghalluwon Garden is full of many attractions, includes Ojakgyo Bridge, symbolizing the bridge connecting Chilseok and Gyeonwu from the traditional story of Chilseok, as well as Chunhyang Hall, Wolmae-jip (house of Chunhyangs mother), Wanwoljeong Pavilion, Yeongjugak Pavilion, Samsinsan and many other traditional buildings.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-63-620-6172|\n|parking:|Available (Small vehicles: 213 spaces / Large vehicles: 66 spaces)|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|April-October: 08:00-20:00 (Free admission after 19:00) <br>November-March: 08:00-20:00 (Free admission after 18:00)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|[Admission to Gwanghalluwon Garden]<br> Adults (ages 19-64): 3,000 won / Group: 2,500 won / Special discount: 1,800 won<br> Teenagers (ages 13-18): 2,000 won / Group: 1,500 won / Special discount: 1,000 won<br> Children (ages 7-12): 1,500 won / Group: 1,000 won / Special discount: 700 won<br> <br> * Group: over 30 people (must enter together with same purpose)<br> * Special discount: holders of same-day admission ticket to Chunhyang Theme Park<br> * Free admission: Preschoolers (ages 6 and younger), Senior citizems (ages 65 and older)|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Information center, resturant, shops|\n|Parking Fees:|Sedan: One-day parking 2,000 won / Monthly parking 30,000 won <br> Small bus (15 passengers or under): One-day parking 2,000 won / Monthly parking 30,000 won <br> Mid-sized & Large bus (16 passengers or more): One-day parking 4,000 won / Monthly parking 60,000 won<br> Freight vehicles (1 ton or under): One-day parking 2,000 won / Monthly parking 30,000 won<br> Freight vehicles (more than 1 ton): One-day parking 3,000 won / Monthly parking 45,000 won|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-31-1672482914287/1604098_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-31-1672482914287/1604098_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-31-1672482914287/1604100_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-31-1672482914287/1604100_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-31-1672482914287/2563391_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-31-1672482914287/2563391_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-31-1672482914287/1604099_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-31-1672482914287/1604099_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-31-1672482914287/1604101_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-31-1672482914287/1604101_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-31-1672482914287/1604102_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-31-1672482914287/1604102_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-31-1672482914287/1604103_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-31-1672482914287/1604103_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-31-1672482914287/1604104_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-31-1672482914287/1604104_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-31-1672482914287/1604105_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-31-1672482914287/1604105_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-63-620-6172](tel:+82636206172)\n- [üè†www.gwanghallu.or.kr](http://www.gwanghallu.or.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.4029038525\nlongitude: 127.3793853018\ntitle: 1447, Yocheon-ro, Namwon-si, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Express/Intercity Bus]<br>\nTake a bus from Central City Terminal to Namwon Bus Terminal.<br><br>\n\n[Train]<br>\nTake a train from Yongsan Station to Namwon Station.<br>\n<br>\n\n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Namwon Express Bus Terminal or Namwon Intercity Bus Terminal, take Bus No. 211, 220, 230, or 281 to Chueo Samgeori Bus Stop.<br><br>\n\nFrom Namwon Station, take Bus No. 133, 142, or 161 to Jaeil Bank Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-31-1672482914287","title":"Gwanghalluwon Garden (Í¥ëÌïúÎ£®Ïõê)","description":"Originally known as Gwangtongnu, Gwanghalluwon Garden was built by Hwang Hui Jeongseung in 1419 during the reign of Joseon dynasty‚Äôs King Sejong.

The valley is also befittingly named Baniram since it is so deep that it only receives direct sunlight for half the day. There are many strangely-shaped rocks like Jjokduri Rock, Cheollyeop Rock, and Daebul Rock scattered throughout the lush valley. At the peak of summer, the area is crowded with vacationers and is also popular for its autumn leaves.","regDate":"2023-01-10","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Valleys"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-10-1673332804228/219600_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-10-1673332804228"},{"id":"2023-01-10-1673328964294","title":"Uhwajeong Pavilion (Ïö∞ÌôîÏ†ï(ÎÇ¥Ïû•ÏÇ∞))","description":"Uhwajeong Pavilion takes its name from the legend that the pavilion once grew wings and ascended into the heavens.

Tapsa Temple is famous for the over 80 stone pagodas built by Lee Gapyong, a retired scholar. Those stone pagodas have different sizes and shapes from cone-shaped to straight-shaped. Behind Daeungjeon, Cheonjitap tower is located. It is the largest tower, with a x_height 3 times as high as the average adult‚Äôs x_height. How this tall tower was built is still unclear, drawing much attention from people. It is said that those stone pagodas were made in the late 1800s entirely by Lee Gapyong alone. He collected stones in daytime and built the pagodas at night. Even though the pagodas have been around for more than 100 years, they have never collapsed nor even moved through strong winds, making them truly amazing.<br>Tapsa Temple is also well known for cherry blossoms in spring, covering an area of 1.9km from Nambu (south) parking lot of Maisan Mountain to the entrance (a 30min walk). This road is the venue for Maisan Cherry Blossom Festival as well. <br><br>* Cheonjitap is comprised of two twin pagodas with x_heights of 13.5m and placed in the south and north directions. Cheonjitap is the main pagoda, making the other pagodas at Tapsa Temple look well-balanced. It is believed that 120 towers originally existed, but only 80 of them remain today. The two towers at the very front are named Ilgwangtap and Wolgwangtap. These groups of towers are strong enough to stand up to typhoon winds, something quite hard to believe, giving the towers a certain mystery. Also, towers are tilted slightly in both directions, showing that Lee Gapyong erected the towers with the direction of the wind in mind.","regDate":"2023-01-10","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-10-1673325568605/1605767_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-10-1673325568605"},{"id":"2023-01-10-1673321782101","title":"Taekwondowon Observatory (ÌÉúÍ∂åÎèÑÍ≥µÏõê Ï†ÑÎßùÎåÄ)","description":"Taekwondowon located in Muju-gun, Jeollabuk-do, serves as a main center for the 60 million taekwondo practitioners in 182 countries worldwide.
