Its original name was Dongnae Mountain Fortress, but it was changed because of its location.   \n<br>\n<br>\nWith a length of 17,377 meters and x_height of 1.5 to 3 meters high, it was the largest fortress in Korea. Currently, there is only a 4 kilometer long section remaining from the original form. The exact time of the initial fortification is not recorded, but in reference to the location and size, it is presumed to have been built during the Three Kingdoms Era.The present fortress was built in 1703, during the reign of King Sukjong. It was built after the Imjin War (1592-1598) to prepare for any further invasions. It was first built with stones and was renovated in 1707.  During the Japanese Colonization, it was severely damaged. Three of the four main gates (East, West, and South Gates) were recovered in 1970.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>• For more info: +82-51-519-4092|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-17-1660721815526/1153157_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-17-1660721815526/1153157_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-17-1660721815526/1605351_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-17-1660721815526/1605351_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-51-519-4092](tel:+82515194092)\n- [🏠tour.geumjeong.go.kr</a> (Korean only)<br><a href=\"http://www.cha.go.kr\" target=\"_blank\">www.cha.go.kr](http://tour.geumjeong.go.kr/main.php/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.2587890268\nlongitude: 129.0559836837\ntitle: Geumseong-dong, Geumjeong-gu, Busan-si\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway +  Bus]<br>\nOncheonjang Station (Busan subway line 1), Exit 5. <br>\n- Turn right from the exit and walk for about 60m before turning into 153  Jungangdae-ro 1 Beon-gil. <br>\n- Walk straight for about  130 m and turn right again at the intersection.

It was originally called Songhyeonsan Mountain, which means a mountain with a view of the sea through the dense pine tree forest. Later, the name was changed to Yongdusan Mountain, as the mountain peak was shaped similar to a dragon's head, protecting the area against foreign invaders overseas.<br><br>The mountain held shrines for the mountain gods built by the Japanese before the 8.15 Liberation. Now the mountain is home to a variety of monuments, including Cheokhwabi Monument, Chunghontap Pagoda, 4.19 Revolution Monument, a statue of Admiral Yi Sun-shin, and Busan Tower. During the Korean War, refugees built houses on the sides of the mountain all the way to the summit but these neighborhoods burned down twice, leaving the mountain bare. Since then, fierce efforts of planting trees have led to transforming the burnt mountain into a beautiful park. The park was called Unam Park at the time of the Liberal Party’s ruling but was renamed to Yongdusan Park after the April 19 Revolution. The park offers a beautiful view of Busan Port and the surrounding scenery. In particular, the night view from Busan Tower is magnificent.","regDate":"2022-08-18","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Busan","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-18-1660838172085/2640557_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Busan/2022-08-18-1660838172085"},{"id":"2022-08-18-1660831088170","title":"UN Memorial Cemetery in Korea (재한유엔기념공원)","description":"The UN Memorial Cemetery in Korea honors UN soldiers from 16 countries and UN aids from five countries that were killed in battle during the Korean War from 1950-1953.
