This valley is Baegundonggyegok Valley.  For almost 6 km, the water of the valley flows over only rocks, with over twenty large and small falls and lakes.  Large stones in the valley are gorgeous because the stones are washed with sunbeams and the strong current of water.  The most famous falls are Baeunpokpo Waterfall and Odampokpo Waterfall.  Strong current of water flows in Deungcheondae, where the letters ‚ÄòYeongnamjeilcheonsok‚Äô are carved.  Baegundonggyegok Valley is a clean area due to maintenance of the clean natural environment.  Many tourists visit here because the valley is decorated with azaleas in the spring and it is cool in the summer.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-55-970-6421~3|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-30-1659159589087/1889976_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659159589087/1889976_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659159589087/1889977_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659159589087/1889977_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659159589087/1889980_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659159589087/1889980_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-55-970-6421~3](tel:+82559706421~3)\n- [üè†www.sancheong.go.kr](http://www.sancheong.go.kr/tour/index.do)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.2963413776\nlongitude: 127.8835964068\ntitle: Baegun-ro 51beon-gil, Danseong-myeon, Sancheong-gun, Gyeongsangnam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \nFrom Seoul Nambu Bus Terminal, take an intercity bus  to Sancheong Intercity Bus Terminal.Take a taxi for approx. 30 min. to the valley.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-30-1659159589087","title":"Baegundonggyegok Valley, Sancheong (Î∞±Ïö¥ÎèôÍ≥ÑÍ≥°(ÏÇ∞Ï≤≠))","description":"If you go 5 km up along the valley at Baegam-ri, under the thick woods, you will find a 180 square meter long stone named ‚ÄòJeomjeong Rock‚Äô and a small waterfall.
