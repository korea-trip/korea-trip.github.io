It is located on the southeast side of Jeju, and is a flat crater, about 650 meters wide, 100 meters deep, and 2,070 meters in circumference. If you look at the crater from above up, it looks like a man-made circular stadium. There is a variety of plant-life in the crater.  On the north side, Nandaeseong vegetation such as red-thorn trees, and magnolia trees grow, along with the rare winter strawberries.  On the south side of the crater, Ondaerim vegetation such as evergreens, maples, and mountain strawberry trees cover the area.  Because so many different kinds of trees and plants grow in such a limited space, it attracts the attention of researchers as well.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-64-783-9900|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A Open all year round|\n|usetime:|March-October 09:00-18:40<br>November-February 09:00-17:40<br>* Last admission 40 min before closing<br>* Closing hours are subject to change depending on weather conditions.|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Film Locations:|Movie ‘’Love Wind, Love Song (1999)”<br>Drama “Goddess of Marriage (2013)”|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 6,000 won / Teenagers 4,000 won / Children 3,000 won<br>Groups - Adults 5,000 won / Teenagers 2,500 won / Children 2,500 won<br><br>* Groups: 20 people or more|\n|Available Facilities:|Pavilion, silver grass field, mineral spring, resting area, local restaurant, free storage room, etc.|\n  \n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-64-783-9900](tel:+82647839900)\n- [🏠www.sangumburi.net ](http://www.sangumburi.net)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.4323127375\nlongitude: 126.6928183084\ntitle: 768, Bijarim-ro, Jeju-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Taxi]<br>\nApprox. 40 min from Jeju International Airport.\n","data":{"id":"2023-02-11-1676093723454","title":"Sangumburi Crater (산굼부리)","description":"Sangumburi Crater has been designated as a Natural Monument.

The word “Samseonghyeol” means “three clans holes”, referring to the three 品 shaped holes in the middle of the forest. Each hole is separated from the other holes by a few meters.<br><br> Legend has it that Samseonghyeol is the place where three demigods, the founding fathers of Tamna (the former name of Jeju), first appeared. They lived by hunting and gathering until&nbsp;they married three princesses from Byeokrangguk, whom came to shore in a wooden box. The three princesses brought with them a calf, pony, and five different seeds that eventually helped to establish agriculture in Jeju.<br><br> Curiously, the three holes are not percolated by rain or snow.  The ancient trees surrounding the holes look as if they are bowing to them, often surprising visitors. It takes just about 30 minutes to look around Samseonghyeol and its vicinity.","regDate":"2023-02-18","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-18-1676698598035/1618334_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-18-1676698598035"},{"id":"2023-02-18-1676695893214","title":"Saeseom Island Saeyeongyo Bridge (새섬 새연교)","description":"Saeyeongyo Bridge is the longest pedestrian overpass created in the southern-most area of the country.
