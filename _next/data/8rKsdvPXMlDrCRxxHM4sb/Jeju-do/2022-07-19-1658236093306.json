Although the exact date of construction is uncertain, it is estimated that the building was built around the same time as Daejeonghyeon in 1416.<br>\n <br> The school was originally located inside Bukseong but it was once moved outside of Dongmun and then again to the site of Seoseong. It was finally moved to Dansan Oreum where it remains to this day. At present, Daejeonghyanggyo Confucian School  consists of Daeseongjeon, Myeongryundang, Dongjae, Seojae Shinsammun, Daeseongmun, Dongmalmun and Dongjeongmun. Daeseongjeon was remodeled in 1669, 1688, and 1752. Myeongryundang was rebuilt in 1772. After several instances of remodeling and rebuilding, Daeseongjeon was remodeled again in 1993. The Confucian school was designated as the Jeju Tangible Cultural Asset No. 4 in August 1971.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-64-742-8866|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-19-1658236093306/1617302_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658236093306/1617302_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658236093306/1617303_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658236093306/1617303_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658236093306/1617305_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658236093306/1617305_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658236093306/1617306_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658236093306/1617306_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658236093306/1617307_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658236093306/1617307_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658236093306/1617308_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658236093306/1617308_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658236093306/1617309_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658236093306/1617309_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-64-742-8866](tel:+82647428866)\n- [üè†www.visitjeju.net</a> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese, Malay) <br / ><br><a href=\"http://www.cha.go.kr/\" target=\"_blank\">www.cha.go.kr](http://www.visitjeju.net/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.2392193306\nlongitude: 126.2884466303\ntitle: 165-17, Hyanggyo-ro, Andeok-myeon, Seogwipo-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \nFrom Jeju International Airport Bus Stop, take Bus No. 152 to Sagye-ri Office Bus Stop and walk for approx. 1.6km.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-19-1658236093306","title":"Daejeonghyanggyo Confucian School (ÎåÄÏ†ïÌñ•Íµê)","description":"Daejeonghyanggyo was a Confucian school during Joseon Dynasty.
