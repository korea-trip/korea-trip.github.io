The island is quite small, at only 300 ㎡, and is home to approximately 80 people in 30 families. The island is famous for sea fishing, and is accessible via ferry from Museulpo Port.<br><br>Marado Island first became inhabited in 1883, when three families began living there. At first they lived off the food growing there, but once the food became scarce, they burned the forests to create fields for farming. It was said that all the snakes and frogs died in that fire, and thus no snakes and frogs are found in Marado Island even until now.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-64-760-4014|\n|parking:|Available at the harbor|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Accommodations, restaurants, Marado Lighthouse, Pioneer Open Air Museum, The Southernmost Monument, etc.|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-02-10-1676004031764/200086_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-10-1676004031764/200086_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-10-1676004031764/200099_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-10-1676004031764/200099_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-10-1676004031764/200111_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-10-1676004031764/200111_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-10-1676004031764/865913_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-10-1676004031764/865913_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-10-1676004031764/1281904_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-10-1676004031764/1281904_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-10-1676004031764/1281919_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-10-1676004031764/1281919_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-10-1676004031764/1281923_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-10-1676004031764/1281923_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-10-1676004031764/1281935_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-10-1676004031764/1281935_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-10-1676004031764/200116_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-10-1676004031764/200116_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-10-1676004031764/1281917_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-10-1676004031764/1281917_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-64-760-4014](tel:+82647604014)\n- [🏠www.jejumarado.com](http://www.jejumarado.com/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.1186350844\nlongitude: 126.2674344514\ntitle: 46, Mara-ro 101beon-gil, Seogwipo-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Ferry]<br>\nTake a ferry from Museulpo Port to Marado Island.\n","data":{"id":"2023-02-10-1676004031764","title":"Marado Island (Mara Provincial Park) (마라도(마라해양도립공원))","description":"Marado Island is the southernmost island in Korea and features one seemingly endless plain of waving grass for a unique landscape.
