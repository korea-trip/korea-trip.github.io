There are 735 traditional Korean hanok houses. While the rest of the city has been industrialized, Hanok Village retains its historical charms and traditions. <br /><br />The charm of Jeonju Hanok Village lies in the hanok buildings unique roof edges, which are slightly raised to the sky. Hanok houses are generally divided into two sections, <em>anchae</em> and <em>sarangchae</em>. Sarangchae is where the men dwell. Because men and women had to remain separated, anchae is situated deep inside the house so that it is secretive and quiet. <br /><br />Another trait of hanok is that all the houses are heated with ondol, a unique floor heating system. Since Koreans enjoy sitting, eating, and sleeping on the floor, it needs to remain heated in winter. To experience what hanok is like, visitors can either book a hanok accommodation or visit the Hanok Life Experience Hall.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-63-282-1330|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Available Facilities:|[Cultural facilities]<br>Jeonju Craft Exhibition, Jeonju Sori Arts Center, Jeonju Fan Museum, etc.<br><br>[Cultural heritages]<br>Gyeonggijeon Shrine, Portrait of King Taejo, Jeondong Cathedral, Jeonjuhyanggo Local Confucian School, etc.<br><br>[Unique attractions]<br>Jaman Mural Village, Nambu Night Market, Jeonju Nanjang, etc.|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-04-1672824967328/2674220_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-04-1672824967328/2674220_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-04-1672824967328/2674221_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-04-1672824967328/2674221_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-04-1672824967328/2674222_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-04-1672824967328/2674222_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-04-1672824967328/2674223_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-04-1672824967328/2674223_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-63-282-1330](tel:+82632821330)\n- [🏠hanok.jeonju.go.kr](http://hanok.jeonju.go.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.8183333748\nlongitude: 127.1536778411\ntitle: 99, Girin-daero, Wansan-gu, Jeonju-si, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-04-1672824967328","title":"Jeonju Hanok Village [Slow City] (전북 전주 한옥마을 [슬로시티])","description":"Jeonju Hanok Village is located in the city of Jeonju and overlaps Pungnam-dong and Gyo-dong.

Sut Maibong (alt. 667 meters) is said to be the male peak while the slightly larger Am Maibong (alt. 673 meters) is deemed the female peak. In the early Joseon period the mountain was named ‘Sokgeumsan,’ but began to be called ‘Maisan’ after the 12th year of King Taejong, who commented that the two peaks resembled horse ears (‘maisan’ meaning ‘horse ears’). All along Maisan Mountain, visitors will find small crater-like rock cavities that are formed by prolonged weathering. These unique geological features, called ‘tafoni,’ are of great academic value. <br><br>Inside Hwaeomgul Cave, visitors can observe medicinal water that flows up from underground all throughout the year. It is widely believed that once you drink the water, especially on the days of the Spring and Autumn Equinox, you will soon have a son and be blessed by the mountain spirit. Even today, many women who have difficulty conceiving visit the mountain to pray to the mountain spirits for their heart’s desire—the gift of a child. The region in which Maisan is located is the birthplace of many talented people and national heroes, which some say is proof of the blessings of the mountain and its extremely powerful spirit.","regDate":"2023-01-06","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-06-1672976184633/198644_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-06-1672976184633"},{"id":"2023-01-05-1672915064725","title":"Korea Expressway Corporation Arboretum (Jeonju Arboretum) (한국도로공사수목원(전주수목원))","description":"Korea Expressway Corporation Arboretum (Jeonju Arboretum) is located in a relatively warm region of the country, reaching 20-30 meters in altitude.
