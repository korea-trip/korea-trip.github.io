This oddly-shaped stone arch is called Seongmun, which means Stone Gate.&nbsp;Due to&nbsp;its fascinating scenery, Seongmunm is the second of Danyang’s Eight Scenic Beauties. To the left of the Stone Gate is a small cave. Inside the cave is Okdap (Stone Field), which is believed to have been cultivated by an old enchantress. The legend of Okdap says that an old enchantress who lived in heaven once came to the earth to get water and then dropped her <em>binyeo</em> (traditional Korean hairpin) near Seongmun. As she searched for her binyeo, she was extremely impressed by the beautiful views. Mesmerized, she&nbsp;left heaven and lived near Seongmun as an ordinary peasant, growing crops and expanding farmlands.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-43-422-1146|\n|parking:|Available|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Parking Fees:|[On-day parking]<br>Sedans 2,000 won<br>Buses 4,000 won<br><br>[Overnight parking]<br>Sedans 4,000 won<br>Buses 8,000|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Available Facilities:|Music fountain, Dodamsambong cruise, etc.|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Guide in English, Japanese, & Chinese available from Danyang Tourist Center.|\n|Korean Info.
