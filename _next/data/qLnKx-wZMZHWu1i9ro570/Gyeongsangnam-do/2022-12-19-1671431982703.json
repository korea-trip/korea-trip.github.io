Only hikers with stamina can trail the course from Baengmu-dong to Hansingyegok Valley to Seseok. During the summer season, the valley area is an optimal vacationing spot due to its thick forests and cold, clear water. It’s a great spot for seeing the autumn foliage and for hiking in the winter snow.","regDate":"2022-12-19","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Valleys"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-19-1671428172263/1978663_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-19-1671428172263","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-19-1671428172263"},{"id":"2022-12-19-1671424744273","title":"Hansando Island (한산도)","description":"Hansando Island is located in the middle of Hallyeohaesang National Park.
