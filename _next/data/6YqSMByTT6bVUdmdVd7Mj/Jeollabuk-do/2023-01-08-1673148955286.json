In 1846, the Nongae-saeng-jang-hyang-su-myeong-bi monument was put up in praise of Nongae’s patriotism. In 1955, a shrine was built and named Uiamsa, which was then moved to the current location in 1974. Within the precincts of the shrine are a memorial stone, the portrait of Nongae by artist Kim Eun-ho, and three gates Woesammun, Naesammun and Chunguimun erected one after another. At the memorial hall, the existing possessions of Nongae and her husband General Choi Gyeong-hoe are on display. The annual Nongae Festival takes places on September 3rd by the lunar calendar, during which memorial services and cultural events are held to commemorate Nongae.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-63-350-2326|\n|parking:|Available|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00 (Winter 09:00-17:00)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Memorial Hall, monument house, etc.|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798134_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798134_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798184_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798184_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798188_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798188_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798191_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798191_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798200_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798200_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798210_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798210_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798223_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798223_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798227_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798227_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798239_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798239_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798162_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798162_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-63-350-2326](tel:+82633502326)\n- [🏠www.cha.go.kr](http://www.cha.go.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.6411181919\nlongitude: 127.5180751461\ntitle: 393, Hannuri-ro, Jangsu-gun, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>From Jangsu Intercity Bus Terminal, walk for approx. 10 min.\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-08-1673148955286","title":"Nongae Shrine (Uiamsa Shrine) (논개사당(의암사))","description":"Uiamsa Shrine was built to the memory of Chu Nongae, who sacrificed her life during the Imjin War (Japanese Invasion of Korea).

The temple was established because of the theory of divination, based on topology. The belief held that Korea’s good spirit would be taken away to Japan, bringing bad luck if the temple was not constructed at this particular location. The temple was reconstructed in the 26th year of King Sukjong’s reign (1700) after it was completely destroyed during the Imjin War (1592-1598). However, it was almost burnt down in the 19th year of King Gojong’s reign (1882).<br> <br>It is presently preserved just as it was during the Unified Silla Kingdom, with its three-story pagoda and its 11 treasures with a total of 17 cultural assets. The entrance of the temple lies in the middle of a rice field and the temple has a pastoral view, surrounded by trees. From the entrance, visitors can cross the half-moon shaped stone bridge to find a remarkable totem pole.","regDate":"2023-01-07","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-07-1673084146360/1604040_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-07-1673084146360","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-07-1673084146360"},{"id":"2023-01-07-1673080623612","title":"Namwon Recreational Forest (남원자연휴양림)","description":"Namwon Recreational Forest is located at the base of Cheonhwangsan Mountain.
