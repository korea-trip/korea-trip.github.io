Like most beaches along the southern coast, the waters of Jinha are shallow, warm, and calm, making it a perfect place for swimming. The deep scent of the surrounding pine trees mixes with the sea breeze and gives the beach an intimate atmosphere despite its relatively large size.<br><br>\n\nCamping is allowed in the pine woods and is free of charge. Simple shower booths and changing rooms are available for the convenience of the visitors. Freshwater river bathing is also available as the water from Hoeyagang River from Munsusan Mountain flows into the beach area.\n<br><br>\nNear the beach is Ideokdo Island, which consists of two mid-ocean rocks, and Myeongseungdo Island, which can be reached on foot. The latter, in particular, is popular for its beautiful sunset and is famous as a great fishing spot for noraemi, flounder, and rockfish. Around 10 kilometers away is Ganjeolgot Lighthouse, which is in operation 24 hours a day.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|expagerange:|Open to visitors of all ages|\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-52-238-1438|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Shower booth, drinking fountain, changing room, cooking area, tube, parasol, etc.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-16-1657986110987/217384_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-16-1657986110987/217384_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-16-1657986110987/2507179_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-16-1657986110987/2507179_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-16-1657986110987/2507180_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-16-1657986110987/2507180_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-16-1657986110987/2507181_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-16-1657986110987/2507181_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-16-1657986110987/2507184_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-16-1657986110987/2507184_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-16-1657986110987/2507185_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-16-1657986110987/2507185_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-16-1657986110987/2507186_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-16-1657986110987/2507186_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-16-1657986110987/2507187_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-16-1657986110987/2507187_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-16-1657986110987/530644_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-16-1657986110987/530644_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-52-238-1438](tel:+82522381438)\n- [üè†tour.ulju.ulsan.kr](http://tour.ulju.ulsan.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.3827277372\nlongitude: 129.3451995038\ntitle: Jinha-ri, Ulju-gun, Ulsan\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-16-1657986110987","title":"Jinha Beach (ÏßÑÌïòÌï¥ÏàòÏöïÏû•)","description":"Jinha Beach is located 20 kilometers southeast of Ulsan and is a little slice of summer paradise measuring 1 kilometer in length and 300 meters in x_width.

The main fortress is located on a mountaintop 200 meters above sea level, a  second fortress is halfway down the mountain, and a  third fortress is located at the bottom of the mountain. The  whole fortress is rectangular shaped. The fortress wall is 6 meters high and slants at an angle of 15 degrees.<br> <br>In 1594, a Buddhist monk named&nbsp;Samyeong-daesa came to Seosaengpo Waeseong Fortress four times to negotiate for peace, but he failed each time. In 1598, the fortress was taken over by Korea with the assistance of General Magwi of the Ming dynasty. A year later, Changpyodang Shrine was built in honor of 53 Koreans who died during battles against the Japanese invading forces. However, the shrine was destroyed during the Japanese imperialism period and no trace of it remains. It is possible to tell from Seosaengpo Jinseongdo (a map drawn up in 1872) that the fortress was also partially used by  Korean forces.","regDate":"2022-08-19","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Ulsan","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Fortresses"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-19-1660914228428/217707_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Ulsan/2022-08-19-1660914228428"},{"id":"2022-08-19-1660908851329","title":"Seongnamsa Temple (ÏÑùÎÇ®ÏÇ¨ Ïö∏ÏÇ∞)","description":"The name of the temple is believed to have originated from the fact that it is located south of Gajisan Mountain or Seokansan Mountain.
