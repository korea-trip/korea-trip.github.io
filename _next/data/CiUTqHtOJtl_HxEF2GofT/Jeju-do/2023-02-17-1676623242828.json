The maze is made mainly using stone and wood found on Jeju and is created to reflect the Jejus three principle items or Samda, which describes the things abundant on Jeju Island  rocks, wind, and women. The maze not only offers a fun activity for you and your friends, but also provides health benefits as the stones emit high levels of far-infrared radiation and the woods (T. occidentalis) produce a large volume of phytoncides. The park, with its variety of trees several decades old, is the perfect place for forest bathing,‚Äù in which people surround themselves with nature (particularly trees) to soak in the natural benefits.<br><br>In addition to the mazes made of trees and stones, visitors are encouraged to check out the maze museum detailing the history of mazes starting from their origin in the 14th century. During the museum tour, visitors may also participate in hands-on activities such as puzzles and games.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-64-784-3838|\n|opendate:|April 14, 2011|\n|parking:|Available (800 parking spaces)|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|November-January: 09:00-17:30 (last ticketing 16:30)<br /><br>February-March / October: 09:00-18:00 (last ticketing 17:00)<br /><br>April-May / August-September: 09:00-18:30 (last ticketing 17:30)<br /><br>June-July: 09:00-19:00 (last ticketing 18:00)<BR>* May, 2020 Last ticketing 17:00, last admission 18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Shopping Information:|Store, cafe, etc.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|Adults: Individual 11,000 won / Group 9,000 won<br>Teenagers: Individual 9,000 won / Group 7,000 won<br>Children/Senior citizens: Individual 8,000 won / Group 6,000 won<br>* Group: 30 people or more. <br>* Teenagers (middle to high school students) / Senior citizens (ages 65 and over) / Children (ages 3 to elementary school students)|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Reservation Info. for Foreigners:|Accepted via telephone (+82-64-784-3838)|\n  \n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-64-784-3838](tel:+82647843838)\n- [üè†www.mazeland.co.kr](http://www.mazeland.co.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.4887498991\nlongitude: 126.8006909929\ntitle: 2134-47, Bijarim-ro, Jeju-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2023-02-17-1676623242828","title":"Maze Land (Î©îÏù¥Ï¶àÎûúÎìú)","description":"Maze Land is a themed park boasting the world‚Äôs longest stone maze, measuring roughly 5.3 km in total length.

The cone is comprised of a mix of volanic rock and soil, and in comparison with other oreum, was formed rather recently. Volcanic cones are formed when magma from the main volcano seeps out of weaker points in the surrounding area, and can be considered small volcanos. Yongnunioreum is covered in a lush carpet of grass, and is home to many wildflowers. The name of the cone comes from its shape resembling a dragon laying down.","regDate":"2023-02-19","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-19-1676777923898/1771329_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-19-1676777923898"},{"id":"2023-02-18-1676716610183","title":"Yongcheondonggul Cave [UNESCO World Natural Heritage Site] (Ïö©Ï≤úÎèôÍµ¥ [Ïú†ÎÑ§Ïä§ÏΩî ÏÑ∏Í≥ÑÏûêÏó∞Ïú†ÏÇ∞])","description":"Yongcheondonggul Cave is the most typical form of lava tunnel on Jeju Island and with a total length of approximately 2,470 meters, it is one of the largest.

In particular, a range of carbonate formations such as straw soda, stalactite, columns, flowstones, cave corals, and aragonite crystals can be found inside this large cave that also contains a lake.

It is thought to have been created by lava that erupted from Hallasan Mountain some 25 million years ago. <br><br>One of the unique features of this particular cave is that it has features of both a lava tube and a limestone cave. The entire area surrounding the cave is a huge stratum of seashells and sand, while the interior is a mystical mix of stalactites and stalagmites. Lime covers the cave walls in a series of natural swirls and streaks, bringing to mind the strokes of an abstract painting. Since the cave stays at a constant 17-18‚ÑÉ throughout the year, it‚Äôs a welcome escape from the heat in the summer and a great place to warm up in the winter. <br><br>The cave gets its name from its two branches, which are said to look like the paths of two dragons (‚ÄòSsangyong‚Äô meaning ‚Äòtwo dragons‚Äô in Korean). It is thought that Ssangyonggul Cave and Hyeopjaegul Cave were once one cave since the second entrance of Ssangyonggul Cave is so close to the end of Hyeopjaegul Cave.","regDate":"2023-02-18","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-18-1676712970362/218751_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-18-1676712970362"},{"id":"2023-02-18-1676709536401","title":"Snoopy Garden (Ïä§ÎàÑÌîºÍ∞ÄÎì†)","description":"Snoopy Garden House is where visitors can meet Snoopy and friends from the popular American comic series Peanuts.

They lived by hunting and gathering until&nbsp;they married three princesses from Byeokrangguk, whom came to shore in a wooden box. The three princesses brought with them a calf, pony, and five different seeds that eventually helped to establish agriculture in Jeju.<br><br> Curiously, the three holes are not percolated by rain or snow.
