Yeongsil Trail is known as the best autumn foliage course on Hallasan Mountain. Yeongsil Course is 3.7 kilometers and takes approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes. It starts from Yeongsil Rest Area and follows a relatively gentle slope lined with beautiful trees and autumn foliage for about one kilometer.<br> After that, an uphill path emerges along steep mountain ridges. The deep Yeongsilgyegok Valley and vast rock walls could be the result of a large volcano entrance in the past. After passing Byeongpungbawi Rock, the path becomes relatively flat until Witsaeoruem Rest Area. The first attraction of Yeongsil is a group of volcanic rocks collectively called Yeongsilgiam. These oddly shaped rocks are situated to the right of a big valley at 1,400 meters to 1,600 meters above sea level, soaring upwards towards the sky. Pass by Sajebi Hill to get a glass of mineral spring water, and  reach Eorimok to take the path downwards.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-64-713-9950~1,<br>+82-64-747-9950|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|[Ascent]<br> November-February 06:00-12:00 <br>March-April & September-October 05:30-14:30 <br>May-August 05:00-15:00<br>[Descent]<br>Witsaeoreum Volcanic Cone: November-February 15:00 / March-April & September-October 16:00 / May-August 17:00<br>Dongneung Peak: November-February 13:30 / March-April & September-October 14:00 / May-August 14:30<br>Nambyeok divide: November-February 14:00 / Spring, Fall 14:30 / May-August 15:00<br>* Hiking strictly limited to designated trail|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Available Facilities:|Trail information center, mountain museum, convenience store, etc. |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-02-14-1676364076313/2617905_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-14-1676364076313/2617905_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-14-1676364076313/2617906_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-14-1676364076313/2617906_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-14-1676364076313/2617907_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-14-1676364076313/2617907_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-14-1676364076313/2617908_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-14-1676364076313/2617908_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-64-713-9950](tel:+82647139950)\n- [üè†www.jeju.go.kr/hallasan</a> <br><a href=\"https://visitjeju.net/kr/#\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"ÏÉàÏ∞Ω : ÎπÑÏßìÏ†úÏ£º ÌôàÌéòÏù¥ÏßÄÎ°ú Ïù¥Îèô\">visitjeju.net](https://www.jeju.go.kr/hallasan/index.htm)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.3402306397\nlongitude: 126.4803110551\ntitle: 246, Yeongsil-ro, Seogwipo-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2023-02-14-1676364076313","title":"Yeongsil Trail (Hallasan National Park) (ÌïúÎùºÏÇ∞ ÏòÅÏã§)","description":"Hallasan Mountain has five trails excluding Donnaeko Course that is closed for nature preservation.

The cone is comprised of a mix of volanic rock and soil, and in comparison with other oreum, was formed rather recently. Volcanic cones are formed when magma from the main volcano seeps out of weaker points in the surrounding area, and can be considered small volcanos. Yongnunioreum is covered in a lush carpet of grass, and is home to many wildflowers. The name of the cone comes from its shape resembling a dragon laying down.","regDate":"2023-02-19","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-19-1676777923898/1771329_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-19-1676777923898"},{"id":"2023-02-18-1676716610183","title":"Yongcheondonggul Cave [UNESCO World Natural Heritage Site] (Ïö©Ï≤úÎèôÍµ¥ [Ïú†ÎÑ§Ïä§ÏΩî ÏÑ∏Í≥ÑÏûêÏó∞Ïú†ÏÇ∞])","description":"Yongcheondonggul Cave is the most typical form of lava tunnel on Jeju Island and with a total length of approximately 2,470 meters, it is one of the largest.

In particular, a range of carbonate formations such as straw soda, stalactite, columns, flowstones, cave corals, and aragonite crystals can be found inside this large cave that also contains a lake. This unique cave is astounding in terms of its geological value and beauty.

The cave measures approximately 400 meters in length, 6 meters in x_width, and 3 meters in x_height. It is thought to have been created by lava that erupted from Hallasan Mountain some 25 million years ago. <br><br>One of the unique features of this particular cave is that it has features of both a lava tube and a limestone cave. The entire area surrounding the cave is a huge stratum of seashells and sand, while the interior is a mystical mix of stalactites and stalagmites. Lime covers the cave walls in a series of natural swirls and streaks, bringing to mind the strokes of an abstract painting. Since the cave stays at a constant 17-18‚ÑÉ throughout the year, it‚Äôs a welcome escape from the heat in the summer and a great place to warm up in the winter. <br><br>The cave gets its name from its two branches, which are said to look like the paths of two dragons (‚ÄòSsangyong‚Äô meaning ‚Äòtwo dragons‚Äô in Korean). It is thought that Ssangyonggul Cave and Hyeopjaegul Cave were once one cave since the second entrance of Ssangyonggul Cave is so close to the end of Hyeopjaegul Cave.","regDate":"2023-02-18","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-18-1676712970362/218751_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-18-1676712970362"},{"id":"2023-02-18-1676709536401","title":"Snoopy Garden (Ïä§ÎàÑÌîºÍ∞ÄÎì†)","description":"Snoopy Garden House is where visitors can meet Snoopy and friends from the popular American comic series Peanuts.

The three princesses brought with them a calf, pony, and five different seeds that eventually helped to establish agriculture in Jeju.<br><br> Curiously, the three holes are not percolated by rain or snow.
