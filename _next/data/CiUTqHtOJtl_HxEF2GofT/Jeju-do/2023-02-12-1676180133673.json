Seogwipo Submarine offers safe undersea tours in its recently acquired state of the art submarine from Finland. Munseom, where the submarine travels, is home to outstanding coral reefs, colorful schools of fish, and rich seaweed. The exquisite landscape makes it one of the most beautiful places to dive as well. Going deep into the 40 meter sea-bed, visitors can see countless fish, rare iridescent coral reefs, and a surreal-looking shipwreck with schools of fish surrounding it. Over 20 years of technical knowhow and safe operation (in fact, the longest submarine tour without a single accident on record) make Seogwipo Submarine a must-see attraction on Jeju Island.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-64-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-64-732-6060|\n|parking:|Available (buses 15 parking spaces, cars 70 parking spaces)|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|07:20 - 18:40 (Operates 18 times a day in 40 min intervals)<br>November-February operates until 16:00 <BR>July-August 07:45-18:50 (operates every 35 min.) <BR>* Operation subject to change|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Tour Course Information:|Route<br>Seogwipo Port (Boarding a Passenger Ferry) – Munseom (Board the Submarine) – Diver Show – Coral Garden – Getting off the Submarine – Tour in Munseom – Seogwipo Port|\n|Facility Utilization Fees:|Adults (ages 14 and older)&nbsp;55,000  won&nbsp;<br>Children (ages 3-13)&nbsp;&nbsp;36,000  won&nbsp; <br><br> *&nbsp;Please refer to the website for discount information|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-02-12-1676180133673/1618773_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-12-1676180133673/1618773_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-12-1676180133673/1618774_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-12-1676180133673/1618774_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-12-1676180133673/1618775_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-12-1676180133673/1618775_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-64-732-6060](tel:+82647326060)\n- [🏠www.submarine.co.kr](http://www.submarine.co.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.2392291431\nlongitude: 126.5587093030\ntitle: 40, Namseongjung-ro, Seogwipo-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>\nFrom Jeju International Airport, take the Airport Limousine Bus No. 600 and get off at Seogwipo Wharf Bus Stop.<br>Transfer to a bus bound for Seobugwangwang road and get off at Seogwipo Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2023-02-12-1676180133673","title":"Seogwipo Submarine (서귀포잠수함)","description":"When it opened in 1988, Seogwipo Submarine was the first of its kind in Asia and the third in the world.

The cone is comprised of a mix of volanic rock and soil, and in comparison with other oreum, was formed rather recently. Volcanic cones are formed when magma from the main volcano seeps out of weaker points in the surrounding area, and can be considered small volcanos. Yongnunioreum is covered in a lush carpet of grass, and is home to many wildflowers. The name of the cone comes from its shape resembling a dragon laying down.","regDate":"2023-02-19","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-19-1676777923898/1771329_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-19-1676777923898"},{"id":"2023-02-18-1676716610183","title":"Yongcheondonggul Cave [UNESCO World Natural Heritage Site] (용천동굴 [유네스코 세계자연유산])","description":"Yongcheondonggul Cave is the most typical form of lava tunnel on Jeju Island and with a total length of approximately 2,470 meters, it is one of the largest. It has a unique topology and rich limestone formations such as lava terrace, lava shelves, lava waterfalls, and 140 meters of lava rolls. In particular, a range of carbonate formations such as straw soda, stalactite, columns, flowstones, cave corals, and aragonite crystals can be found inside this large cave that also contains a lake. This unique cave is astounding in terms of its geological value and beauty. There are also items that can be found throughout the cave that appear to have been brought in by people who lived on the island long ago, such as pieces of pottery, animal bones, ironware, charcoal and other substances.<br><br>* The UNESCO World Heritage inscribed Geomunoreum Lava Tube System consists of Bengdwigul, Manjanggul, Gimnyeonggul, Yongcheondonggul and Dangcheomuldonggul Caves.","regDate":"2023-02-18","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-18-1676716610183"},{"id":"2023-02-18-1676712970362","title":"Ssangyonggul Cave (Hallim Park) (쌍용굴 (한림공원))","description":"Ssangyonggul Cave, a designated Natural Monument, is one of the representative lava tubes of Jeju Island along with Hwanggeumgul, Socheongul, and Manjanggul caves. The cave measures approximately 400 meters in length, 6 meters in x_width, and 3 meters in x_height. It is thought to have been created by lava that erupted from Hallasan Mountain some 25 million years ago. <br><br>One of the unique features of this particular cave is that it has features of both a lava tube and a limestone cave. The entire area surrounding the cave is a huge stratum of seashells and sand, while the interior is a mystical mix of stalactites and stalagmites. Lime covers the cave walls in a series of natural swirls and streaks, bringing to mind the strokes of an abstract painting. Since the cave stays at a constant 17-18℃ throughout the year, it’s a welcome escape from the heat in the summer and a great place to warm up in the winter. <br><br>The cave gets its name from its two branches, which are said to look like the paths of two dragons (‘Ssangyong’ meaning ‘two dragons’ in Korean). It is thought that Ssangyonggul Cave and Hyeopjaegul Cave were once one cave since the second entrance of Ssangyonggul Cave is so close to the end of Hyeopjaegul Cave.","regDate":"2023-02-18","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-18-1676712970362/218751_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-18-1676712970362"},{"id":"2023-02-18-1676709536401","title":"Snoopy Garden (스누피가든)","description":"Snoopy Garden House is where visitors can meet Snoopy and friends from the popular American comic series Peanuts.

Each hole is separated from the other holes by a few meters.<br><br> Legend has it that Samseonghyeol is the place where three demigods, the founding fathers of Tamna (the former name of Jeju), first appeared. They lived by hunting and gathering until&nbsp;they married three princesses from Byeokrangguk, whom came to shore in a wooden box. The three princesses brought with them a calf, pony, and five different seeds that eventually helped to establish agriculture in Jeju.<br><br> Curiously, the three holes are not percolated by rain or snow.  The ancient trees surrounding the holes look as if they are bowing to them, often surprising visitors.
