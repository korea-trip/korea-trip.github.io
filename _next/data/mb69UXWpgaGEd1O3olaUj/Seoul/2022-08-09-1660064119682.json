In 1891, Myeongdong Cathedral's head priest Doucet laid down the foundation stone in Hap-dong. Coadjutor bishop Coste was in charge of design and construction and the building was eventually completed in 1892. The church was named after \"Yakjeonhyeon,\" or a hill of medicinal herbs. This is because the place where the church is located was once a hilly area covered with medicinal herbs. Later on, Yakjeonhyeon was shortened to Yakhyeon and it became the name of the hilly area between Malli-dong and Seoul Station.\n<br><br>\nYakhyeon Catholic Church was the first Western-style church ever built in Korea. It's Gothic architecture features a 12-meter-wide and 32-meter-long cruciform construction with low arched windows and a pointed-arch entrance gate.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-2-362-1891|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Not available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-09-1660064119682/1569138_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-09-1660064119682/1569138_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-09-1660064119682/1569143_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-09-1660064119682/1569143_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-09-1660064119682/1985561_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-09-1660064119682/1985561_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-09-1660064119682/2459360_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-09-1660064119682/2459360_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-09-1660064119682/2459362_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-09-1660064119682/2459362_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-09-1660064119682/2459366_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-09-1660064119682/2459366_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-09-1660064119682/2459367_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-09-1660064119682/2459367_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-09-1660064119682/2459369_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-09-1660064119682/2459369_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-09-1660064119682/2459371_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-09-1660064119682/2459371_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-09-1660064119682/1569139_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-09-1660064119682/1569139_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-2-362-1891](tel:+8223621891)\n- [üè†www.yakhyeon.or.kr](http://www.yakhyeon.or.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5591437954\nlongitude: 126.9674194623\ntitle: 447-1, Cheongpa-ro, Jung-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway]<br>\nChungjeongno Station (Seoul Subway Line 2 or 5), Exit 5.<br>\nWalk for approx. 300 m and the church is across from police station.\n<br><br>\n[Bus]<br>\nGet off at the following bus stops: <br>\n\n*In front of Korean Economic Daily: 7011 (Green), 7013A (Green), 7013B (Green), 7017 (Green)<br>\n<br>*Brown Stone, across to Korean Economic Daily: 603 (Blue), 7011 (Green), 7013A (Green), 7013B (Green), 7017 (Green)<br><br>\n*Chungjeongno Station Exit 4: 7017 (Green), 1000, 1101, 1200, 1300, 1301, 1400, 1500, 1100, M6118, 172 (Blue), 472 (Blue), 603 (Blue), 7011 (Green) 7013A (Green),  7013B (Green)<br>\n<br>*Chungjeongno Station Exit 2: 8601, 2500, M6117, 1301, 1000, 1100, 1002, 1200, 1300, 1400, 1500, 172 (Blue), 472 (Blue), 600 (Blue), 602 (Blue), 603 (Blue), 7011 (Green), 7013A (Green), 7013B (Green), 7017 (Green)<br>\n<br>*Seoul Station West Wing (Namyeong-dong direction): 163 (Blue), 261 (Blue), 262 (Blue), 263 (Blue), 604 (Blue)<br><br>\n*Seoul Station West Wing (opposite to the station): 163 (Blue), 261 (Blue), 263 (Blue), 503 (Blue), 604 (Blue)\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-09-1660064119682","title":"Seoul Yakhyeon Catholic Church (ÏÑúÏö∏ ÏïΩÌòÑÏÑ±Îãπ)","description":"Yakhyeon Catholic Church was established as a result of Korea gaining religious freedom in the 23rd year of King Gojong‚Äôs reign (1886) and the subsequent increase of the Catholic population.
