Water jets located in the bade pool shoot out water, which massages various parts of the body and at the same time revitalizes the skin. In addition, you can walk, swim, or exercise in the water stream pool, which has a depth of 120 centimeters. <br><br>Icheon Termeden started as a hot spring spa, but it plans to expand further into a multi-resort complex, which will include hotel and condominium facilities, an arboretum, a golf driving range, and horseback riding.","regDate":"2022-09-09","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Hot Springs & Spa"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-09-1662706944231/2041309_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-09-09-1662706944231","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Gyeonggi-do/2022-09-09-1662706944231"},{"id":"2022-09-09-1662703678782","title":"Temporary Palace at Hwaseong Fortress (Hwaseong Haenggung Palace) (ÌôîÏÑ±ÌñâÍ∂Å)","description":"A <em>haenggung</em> is a temporary palace where the king and royal family retreated to during a war.
