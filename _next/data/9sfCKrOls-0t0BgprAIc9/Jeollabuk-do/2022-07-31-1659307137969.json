The origin of the name \"Gaeam\" goes back to 282 BC, when King Mun from the Byeonhan confederacy took refuge here during the revolt of the Jinhan and Mahan confederacies. Under King Mun's command, temples for the new fortress were built on east and west sides of the valley; the western temple was called Gaeam. In 676, the temple was expanded and in 1276, thirty more buildings were raised, expanding it to a grand temple.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|accomcount:|No limit|\n|expagerange:|Open to visitors age 5 & over|\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<BR> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-63-581-0080|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604186_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604186_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604187_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604187_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604188_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604188_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604189_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604189_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604190_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604190_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604191_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604191_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604192_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604192_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604306_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604306_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604307_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604307_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604308_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604308_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-63-581-0080](tel:+82635810080)\n- [üè†www.gaeamsa.org</a><br /><a href=\"http://gaeamsa.templestay.com\" target=\"_blank\">gaeamsa.templestay.com](http://www.gaeamsa.org)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.6628507594\nlongitude: 126.6498267208\ntitle: 248, Gaeam-ro, Buan-gun, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-31-1659307137969","title":"Gaeamsa Temple (Í∞úÏïîÏÇ¨)","description":"Gaeamsa Temple is a small, quiet temple built in 634 during the Baekje dynasty.

The burial ground covers an area of more than 18,520 square meters and is officially listed as Historical Site No. 347. To date, a total of eight tumuli have been excavated, all of which are chamber tombs. <br><br>Surprisingly enough, the tombs were first discovered in 1986 by a high school student. While digging for arrowroot, a young man from a local high school found some pieces of gold that resembled a hat. He quickly notified the authorities and it was soon discovered that the pieces of gold were in fact valuable ancient artifacts. An emergency excavation was conducted and the eight tumuli were uncovered, but unfortunately all of the tumuli except Tomb No. 1 had been severely damaged. Tomb No. 1, which is still in relatively good condition, boasts an entrance measuring an impressive 16 meters in x_height and 2 meters in x_width. <br><br>Inside the tombs archaeologists found valuable relics from the Baekje dynasty including earthenware, jewelry (a gilt-bronze hat, gold earrings, glass beads, etc.), harnesses and ironware. Given the shapes and the types of the pieces found, historians estimate that the tumuli were built in the 5th century. Since the gilt-bronze hat is similar in shape to those found in Japan, experts believe that there was an active exchange between the Baekje people and the people of Japan.","regDate":"2023-01-03","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-03-1672727891410/573722_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-03-1672727891410"},{"id":"2023-01-03-1672724152946","title":"Iksan Godori Standing Stone Buddha (ÏùµÏÇ∞ Í≥†ÎèÑÎ¶¨ ÏÑùÏ°∞Ïó¨ÎûòÏûÖÏÉÅ)","description":"Iksan Godori Standing Stone Buddha is Treasure No. 46.

After the sunset on that special day, the lovers are allowed to meet, but must return to their respective positions before the rooster crows at dawn. <br><br>The two statues are very representative of the Goryeo era, which produced many stone statues with minimal expression of the physical body. True to the era, each Buddha has almost no curves and is depicted with plain clothing and barely distinguishable arms. <br><br>On their heads, the Buddhas wear a crown topped with another square hat. With their square faces, small eyes, pug noses, and small lips, the Buddhas are reminiscent of guardian deities typically placed at the entrance of villages.","regDate":"2023-01-03","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-03-1672724152946/1308525_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-03-1672724152946"},{"id":"2023-01-03-1672720692416","title":"House of Lee Young-choon (Ïù¥ÏòÅÏ∂òÍ∞ÄÏò•)","description":"The House of Lee Young-choon was constructed by a Japanese landlord named Kumamoto during the Japanese colonial era.
