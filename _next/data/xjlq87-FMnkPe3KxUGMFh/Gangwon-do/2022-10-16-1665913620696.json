The peak is made of strange rocks stretching from the foot of the mountain to the top at 900 m above sea level. The peak consists of six rocks, which create a majestic view of the rocky peak. The peak with the circumference of 4 km forms a great panoramic view along with Daecheongbong Peak and Outer Seorak. Ulsan Peak presents an imposing scene, and it was visited by many famous poets and calligraphers including Choe Yeon and Heo Jeok during the Joseon period who left behind their records. In addition, several legends are associated with Ulsan Peak. One day, a heavenly god commanded peaks of all mountains to assemble at Geumgangsan Mountain to create the greatest scenery. However, the Ulsan Peak was too heavy, so it was late for the meeting. Feeling ashamed, it didn‚Äôt go back home (Ulsan) directly, and took a rest at Seoraksan Mountain, but stayed there forever. Also, there is a saying that the peak was named after the shape of the rock, which resembles a fence (ul+tari) or a crying (ul) mountain (san). Visitors can get to the Ulsan Peak by starting from the small park and passing through Sinheungsa Temple and Heundeul Rock. At the beginning of the path, it starts with a gentle slope, but after the Heundeul Rock, there are a steep rocky hill and the iron stairs. It requires about 4 hr for getting to and from the peak. It is hard for the elderly or children to climb because of high level of difficulty.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(English, Korean, Japanese, Chinese)<br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-33-680-3382|\n|parking:|Available (250 spaces)|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Winter season (04:00‚Äì12:00), Summer season (03:00‚Äì14:00)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Small vehicle, Low season, For the day: 4,000 won, Accommodation:  8,000 won<br />Small vehicle, High season, For the day: 5,000 won, Accommodation: 10,000 won<br />Large vehicle, Low season, For the day: KRW 6,000; Accommodation: KRW 12,000Large vehicle, High season, For the day: KRW 7,500; Accommodation: KRW 15,000|\n|Activity Fees:|Adults: 3,500 won / Youth: 1,000 won / Children: 500 won|\n|Reservation Info. for Foreigners:|None|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|None|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-10-16-1665913620696/2654852_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-16-1665913620696/2654852_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-16-1665913620696/2654855_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-16-1665913620696/2654855_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-16-1665913620696/2654856_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-16-1665913620696/2654856_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-16-1665913620696/2711196_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-16-1665913620696/2711196_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-16-1665913620696/2711197_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-16-1665913620696/2711197_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-16-1665913620696/2711198_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-16-1665913620696/2711198_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-33-680-3382](tel:+82336803382)\n- [üè†seorak.knps.or.kr](http://seorak.knps.or.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 38.1869348183\nlongitude: 128.4664782790\ntitle: 1091, Seoraksan-ro, Sokcho-si, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Seoul Express Bus Terminal, take a bus to \nSokcho Express Bus Terminal. <br>From Sokcho Bus Terminal Bus Stop, take Bus No. 7 or 7-1 and get off at Sogongwon Entrance Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-10-16-1665913620696","title":"Ulsanbawi Rock (ÏÑ§ÏïÖÏÇ∞ Ïö∏ÏÇ∞Î∞îÏúÑ)","description":"Ulsan Peak is the most well-known attraction at Seoraksan Mountain.
