The soft, white sand and lush pine trees also make this an ideal beach to visit for a walk. Various accommodations can easily be found here since the area has been a popular tourist destination for quite some time.<br><br>Located south of Daecheon Beach, Muchangpo Beach is where visitors can witness a sea-parting phenomenon in the summer. The 1.5-kilometer “Mystic Sea Road” between Muchangpo Beach and Seokdaedo Island reveals itself when the water levels go down due to the difference in the ebb and flow of the tides. During the sea parting, visitors will be able to catch clams, crabs and shellfish. The beach also offers a breathtaking view of the sunset.<br><br>Jukdo Island is located midway between Daecheon Beach and Muchangpo Beach.
