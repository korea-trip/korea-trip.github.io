The temple sits in the southeast of Gwangdeoksan Mountain, which borders Asan-si and Cheonan-si, and the southwest of Taehwasan Mountain. It was the biggest temple within Chungcheong and Gyeonggi regions before the Japanese invasion. However, it was burnt down during the Japanese invasion and the main buildings such as Daeungjeon, Myeongbujeon and Cheonbuljeon Halls are relatively new compared to the other original facilities.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-41-567-0050|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|04:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-02-1667385940656/878548_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-02-1667385940656/878548_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-02-1667385940656/878572_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-02-1667385940656/878572_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-02-1667385940656/878697_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-02-1667385940656/878697_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-02-1667385940656/878732_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-02-1667385940656/878732_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-02-1667385940656/1602581_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-02-1667385940656/1602581_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-02-1667385940656/1602582_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-02-1667385940656/1602582_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-02-1667385940656/1602594_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-02-1667385940656/1602594_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-02-1667385940656/1602597_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-02-1667385940656/1602597_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-02-1667385940656/1602600_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-02-1667385940656/1602600_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-02-1667385940656/565703_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-02-1667385940656/565703_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-41-567-0050](tel:+82415670050)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.6759083444\nlongitude: 127.0423566072\ntitle: 30, Gwangdeoksa-gil, Dongnam-gu, Cheonan-si, Chungcheongnam-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-02-1667385940656","title":"Cheonan Gwangdeoksa Temple (광덕사(천안))","description":"Gwangdeoksa Temple is said to be established in 637 by Monk Jajang Yulsa during the Silla Kingdom and was refurbished during the reign of King Heungdeok (832).
