It wasn't until 1593 that the palace was used as a temporary palace of the royal family after their home was burned down during the Imjin War. King Seonjo also stayed at Deoksugung Palace after returning to the city. It became a proper palace when Gwanghaegun (1575-1641) ascended to the throne and gave this royal residence the name Gyeongungung Palace in 1611. Over the following decades, the palace alternated between being an official palace and a temporary residence. The name did not change officially to Deoksugung Palace, meaning the ‚Äúpalace of virtuous longevity,‚Äù until 1907. While the palace once encompassed a vast area with many buildings, the current palace grounds are just a small shadow of the prior splendor, with very few structures remaining.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-2-771-9951,<br>+82-2-751-0734, +82-2-751-0753|\n|parking:|Not available|\n|restdate:|Mondays|\n|usetime:|09:00-21:00 <BR>* Last admission 1 hour before closing|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|[Foreign Visitors]<br>Individuals - Adults 1,000 won / Children 500 won<br>Groups - Adults 800 won / Children 400 won<br><br>* Adults (ages 19-64) / Children (ages 7-18)<br>* Group: 10 people or more<br>* Free admission: Preschoolers (ages 6 & younger), senior citizens (ages 65 & older), visitors wearing hanbok, all visitors on the last Wednesday of each month (Culture Day) <br><br>[Combination Ticket for Palaces]<br>- Sites: Changdeokgung Palace, Changgyeonggung Palace, Deoksugung Palace, Gyeongbokgung Palace, Jongmyo Shrine <br>- Fee: 10,000 won (Note, refund not available after using the ticket the first time)<br>- Validity: Up to one month after purchase.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1569114_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1569114_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1569115_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1569115_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1569116_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1569116_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1956603_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1956603_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1956605_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1956605_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1956608_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1956608_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1956609_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1956609_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1956612_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1956612_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1956615_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1956615_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1956617_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1956617_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-2-771-9951](tel:+8227719951)\n- [üè†www.deoksugung.go.kr](http://www.deoksugung.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5661486714\nlongitude: 126.9749296905\ntitle: 99, Sejong-daero, Jung-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-22-1658472507467","title":"Deoksugung Palace (ÎçïÏàòÍ∂Å)","description":"Registered as Historic Site No. 124, Deoksugung Palace was initially not a royal palace, but a residential home of Grand Prince Wolsan (1454-1488), the older brother of King Seongjong (1469-1494) of the Joseon dynasty.

Many people enjoy hiking the path that begins at Sajik Tunnel, which leads to the peak of the mountain passing the fortress walls, then hike back down to Buam-dong. The hiking course is also connected to the road in front of Cheongwadae, so hikers can also walk along the historical Palpan-ro road, Hyoja-ro road, and Gyeongbokgung Palace. The hiking path located behind Sajik Park leads to Hwanghakjeong Pavilion, where archers during the Joseon dynasty once honed their marksmanship. The Hwanghakjeong Pavilion was originally located within the Gyeonghuigung Palace, but was relocated to the mountain. From the top, a panoramic view of the surrounding area spreads as far as Inwangsan Mountain, Naksan Mountain, Namsan Mountain, and Baegaksan Mountain with Gyeongbokgung Palace at its center.<br><br>The hiking path past Sajik Park's T-intersection is a popular walking course to nearby office workers during lunch time. A view of Cheongwadae is visible from atop Beombawi Rock (tiger's rock). For hikers seeking to walk along the ridges, it is recommended to take the path down to Hongje-dong quarry or Jahamun Gate. Hikers are recommended to take their time to fully enjoy the view of the surroundings while walking along the path of the outer walls. The stone stairway following the path past Changuimun Gate will take hikers to the path along the outer walls. This path stretches for approximately 200 meters and a set of stones used to build the city walls during the reign of King Taejo, King Sejong, and King Sukjung still remain along the way. The thick, dark-colored mosses on the stones indicate the long history of Seoul.<br><br>The view of the refreshing landscape and Inwangsan Mountain's peak will greet the hikers once they walk back to the inner city walls through a step of stones. Hikers will be able to get a bird's-eye-view of Seoul's mountains and skyscrapers surrounding the Hangang River. The city walls along the path going down to Cheongun-dong still withhold their beauty from the past.<br><br>Inwangsan Mountain stands at a x_height of 338.2 meters and spreads throughout the regions of Hongje-dong in Seodaemun-gu and Muak-dong, Nusang-dong, Ogin-dong and Buam-dong in Jongno-gu. The unique and colossal rock formations and the view of Seoul and Cheongwadae are only a few of the many charms of Inwangsan Mountain.","regDate":"2022-08-04","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-04-1659605785634/1894462_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-08-04-1659605785634"},{"id":"2022-08-04-1659602774980","title":"Inwangsa Temple (Ïù∏ÏôïÏÇ¨ (ÏÑúÏö∏))","description":"Inwangsa Temple refers to the entire cluster of small Buddhist temples located on Inwangsan Mountain (alt. 338m) in the heart of Seoul.
