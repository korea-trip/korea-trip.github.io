Originally, the street was not known for samchi, but it became one of the most popular menus at the restuarant, with many other shops in the area following in this trend. In 2002, it was designated as the grilled seerfish street and a signboard was put up at the street entrance. Currently, there are about a dozen grilled seerfish restaurants lining the street, and each restaurant has a unique signboard of its own.
