It is the longest tourist cable car in Korea, stretching over a distance of 1,975 meters. Traveling at a speed of 4 meters per second, the cable car takes 9 minutes to travel from one station to the next. Despite the distance, there is only one midway support post, designed to create the lowest level of natural disturbance, as well as increase the view for passengers. There are 47 gondolas able to seat 8 passengers each, so there is very little wait time. Visitors traveling with pets can also bring their pets aboard, as the cable car has opened as a pet-friendly attraction.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-1544-3303|\n|parking:|Available (Small-sized car: 288 spaces / Large-sized car: 11 spaces)|\n|restdate:|2nd & 4th Monday of every month (closed the following day if Monday is a public holiday)|\n|usetime:|[October-March] 09:30-16:00<br>[April & September] 09:30-17:00<br>[May-August] 09:30-18:00 <br><br>* Schedule subject to change; inquire in advance.<br>* Ticketing may end 2-3 hours before closing time.|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Facility Utilization Fees:|[Individuals]<br>Adults: Round-trip 14,000 won / One-way 10,500 won<br>Children: Round-trip 10,000 won / One-way 8,000 won<br><br>[Groups]<br>Adults: Round-trip 13,000 won / One-way 10,000 won<br>Children: Round-trip 9,500 won / One-way 7,500 won<br><br>* Adults (ages 13 and older) / Children (ages 4-12)<br> * Group: 25 people or more|\n|Available Facilities:|Lower Station<br>- Station, rest area, observatory, fishery market, ticket booth, tourism information center, parking lot<br><br>Upper Station<br>- Station, rest area (snack bar), restroom, management office, observatory|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-26-1672032948403/1204865_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-26-1672032948403/1204865_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-26-1672032948403/1204868_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-26-1672032948403/1204868_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-26-1672032948403/1204869_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-26-1672032948403/1204869_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-26-1672032948403/1823752_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-26-1672032948403/1823752_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-1544-3303](tel:+8215443303)\n- [üè†cablecar.ttdc.kr](http://cablecar.ttdc.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 34.8266120596\nlongitude: 128.4250363662\ntitle: 205, Balgae-ro, Tongyeong-si, Gyeongsangnam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Seoul Express Bus Terminal or Seoul Nambu Terminal, take a bus to Tongyeong Intercity Bus Terminal.\n<br>\nFrom Tongyeong Intercity Bus Terminal Bus Stop, take Bus No. 141 and get off at Tongyeong Cable Car Ground Station Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-26-1672032948403","title":"Tongyeong Cable Car (ÌÜµÏòÅÏºÄÏù¥Î∏îÏπ¥)","description":"Tongyeong Cable Car is the only dual-cable automatic circulating gondola system in Korea, built with the most recent technology.

The glittery surface and towering cliffs create a spectacular backdrop. Clear footprints of dinosaurs that lived during the Cretaceous Period of the Mesozoic Era remain extending over the coast around Sangjogam region, and thus the area was designated Goseong-gun Gosi No. 20. on November 10, 1983. <br>The beach in front of the Youth Center contains shingles worn down by the tide and a precipitous wall of stratified rocks can be seen beyond the wide bedrock of dinosaur footprints. The rocks are named after the table leg-shaped stone caves such as ‚ÄúSsangjok‚Äù or ‚ÄúSsangbal‚Äù. Many oddly shaped rocks inside the caves have their own folktales.<br>According to one tale, fairies from heaven came down to the Sangjokgul Cave to weave clothes out of brocade for the King of Heaven, and bathed in the Seonnyoetang Pond. The shape of a loom and a puddle still exist. Nearby the cave, Chotdaebawi Rock and Byeongpungbawi Rock create scenery beyond description and leisure cruise boats toss up gentle sea waves. Naturally, the park continuously attracts numerous tourists in all seasons. <br>Also, many are drawn to the mysterious dinosaur footprint fossils at Sangjogam. The site is recognized as one of three major dinosaurs sites in the world, along with those in Brazil and Canada. The footprints belong to dinosaurs familiarized by the popular movie, ‚ÄòJurassic Park‚Äô, such as Brontosaurus, Brachiosaurus, Allosaurus and Naranosaurus. It has been designated Natural Monument No. 411, as dinosaur footprints are valuable resources in discovering the uncovered mysteries of life before the appearance of mankind.","regDate":"2022-12-29","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","County Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-29-1672303057153/1611219_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-29-1672303057153"},{"id":"2022-12-29-1672299315401","title":"Samcheonpodaegyo Park (ÏÇºÏ≤úÌè¨ÎåÄÍµêÍ≥µÏõê)","description":"Samcheonpodaegyo Park is located near the landmark of Namhae, Samcheonpodaegyo Bridge, which connects Sacheon-si to nearby island.","regDate":"2022-12-29","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Architectural Sights","Bridges"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-29-1672299315401"},{"id":"2022-12-29-1672295914657","title":"Okpo Shipyard of Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (ÎåÄÏö∞Ï°∞ÏÑ†Ìï¥Ïñë(Ï£º) Ïò•Ìè¨Ï°∞ÏÑ†ÏÜå)","description":"Okpo Shipyard of Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering spans over a 4000,000„é° land and consists of large-scale specialized facilities and equipments for shipbuilding and repairs such as a dock that can handle a 1,000,000 ton vessel and a 900 ton Goliath crane.
