Well-known for its rich soil, the most outstanding natural resources of Gurye is Jirisan National Park, the first to be designated as a national park, and Seomjingang River. <br><br>Every year, many hikers visit Jirisan National Park, also called the “bosom of a mother.” The park is cherished for its unpolluted scenery, such as its deep and wide geographical features and crystal clear valleys. The park offers diverse hiking trails and has mountain retreats for backpackers. <br><br>Jirisan Dulegil Trail that runs along the periphery of Jirisan Mountain is where one could enjoy the experience of mountain glens, different from mountaineering. On their way hikers and trekkers can see groups of Sansuyu (cornus fruit) in spring as well as the autumnal tints of the mountain and valley in autumn. <br><br>Another strength is that the park has different types of accommodations including Hanok (Korean traditional house) homestay and a guest house, apart from leisure facilities including hot springs in Jirisan. The park is a great place for historical inquiries as it is filled with historic temples, including Hwaeomsa Temple and Yeongoksa Temple, and historic relics. Flowing from Gokseong to Hadong, Seomjingang River creates a tranquil ambience. The cleanest ever in Korea, a large number of marsh snails and sweetfish live in this river.
