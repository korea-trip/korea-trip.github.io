{"pageProps":{"content":"![Manghaesa Temple (ÎßùÌï¥ÏÇ¨)](/2023-01-06-1672979958647/2675611_image2_1.webp)\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> Manghaesa Temple is located at the edge of the Gimje Plains before the sea. The temple stands at the summit of Jinbongsan Mountain.  The temple was named for the view of the ocean and the fields of rice. The temple was established by the great monk Buseol Geosa during the 2nd year of King Uija of Baekje (AD 642). Years later, Dobeopsa (a Chinese monk from the Tang dynasty) renovated the temple. The temple was altered again during the reign of King Injo of the Joseon dynasty when the great monk Jinmuk Daesa built Nakseojeon Hall in 1589. Bogwangjeon Hall and Chilseonggak Pavilion were built much later in 1933. Manghaesa Temple is unique in that it is the only temple where the distant horizon is visible over both land and sea. Nearby attractions include a walking path through a field of reeds by Mangyeonggang River and views of the sunset over the sea.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-63-540-3324|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|[Temple grounds] 05:00 - Sunset<br>[Observatory & Walking trail] Open 24 hr|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Not available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-06-1672979958647/176749_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-06-1672979958647/176749_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-06-1672979958647/1603990_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-06-1672979958647/1603990_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-06-1672979958647/1603991_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-06-1672979958647/1603991_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-06-1672979958647/1603993_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-06-1672979958647/1603993_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-06-1672979958647/1603995_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-06-1672979958647/1603995_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-06-1672979958647/2675608_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-06-1672979958647/2675608_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-06-1672979958647/2675610_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-06-1672979958647/2675610_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-63-540-3324](tel:+82635403324)\n- [üè†http://www.gimje.go.kr/tour/board/view.gimje?boardId=BBS_0000080&menuCd=DOM_000000403003000000&paging=ok&startPage=1&searchType=DATA_TITLE&searchOperation=AND&keyword=%EB%A7%9D%ED%95%B4%EC%82%AC&dataSid=120428](http://www.gimje.go.kr/tour/board/view.gimje?boardId=BBS_0000080&menuCd=DOM_000000403003000000&paging=ok&startPage=1&searchType=DATA_TITLE&searchOperation=AND&keyword=%EB%A7%9D%ED%95%B4%EC%82%AC&dataSid=120428)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.8597239049\nlongitude: 126.7156797015\ntitle: 94, Simpo 10-gil, Gimje-si, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>\nFrom Gimje Bus Terminal, take Bus No. 18, 19, or 19-1 bound for Simpo or Geojeon-ri and get off at Manghaesa Temple Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-06-1672979958647","title":"Manghaesa Temple (ÎßùÌï¥ÏÇ¨)","description":"Manghaesa Temple is located at the edge of the Gimje Plains before the sea.
