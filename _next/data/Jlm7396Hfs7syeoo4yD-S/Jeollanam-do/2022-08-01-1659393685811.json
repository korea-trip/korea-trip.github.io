The recreational park is located on the mid-slope of Bangjangsan Mountain. Many species of wild flowers and broad-leaved trees are distributed all over Bangjangsan Recreational Forest where an exciting paragliding contest takes place annually. This is a great place to unpack and take a break for one or two days as it has accommodation facilities, promenades and trekking courses as well as a small area for splashing in the water. It takes approximately three hours to the mountain's summit from the recreational forest. In addition, there is a trekking path that leads to the Seokjeong Hot Springs on the way down the mountain.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|accomcount:|500 people for a day|\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-61-394-5523|\n|parking:|Available|\n|usetime:|Accommodations: 15:00 - 12:00 (next day)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 1,000 won / Teenagers 600 won / Children 300 won<br>Groups - Adults 800 won / Teenagers 500 won / Children 200 won<br><br>* Groups - 20 people or more<br>* Adults (ages 19-64) / Teenagers (ages 13-18) / Children (ages 7-12)<br>* Free admission December-March|\n|Facility Utilization Fees:|Accommodations: Low Season & Weekdays / Peak Season & Weekends<br><br>[Forest Cabin] <br>- Rooms (36„é°, 5 people) 46,000 won / 85,000 won<br>- Rooms (46„é°, 8 people) 77,000 won / 134,000 won<br>- Rooms (66„é°, 11 people) 91,000 won / 151,000 won<br><br>[Forest Culture Recreation Center] <br>- Rooms (23„é°~26„é°, 4 people) 39,000 won / 68,000 won<br>- Rooms (29„é°~36„é°, 5-6 people) 50,000 won / 91,000 won<br>- Rooms (49„é°~56„é°, 8-9 people) 85,000 won / 144,000 won|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Compact cars: 1,500 won <br>Small cars: 3,000 won <br>Large vehicles: 5,000 won |\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-01-1659393685811/2040885_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659393685811/2040885_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659393685811/2040890_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659393685811/2040890_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659393685811/2040894_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659393685811/2040894_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659393685811/2040895_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659393685811/2040895_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659393685811/2040898_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659393685811/2040898_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-61-394-5523](tel:+82613945523)\n- [üè†www.huyang.go.kr](http://www.huyang.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.4451632173\nlongitude: 126.7458042490\ntitle: 353, Bangjang-ro, Jangseong-gun, Jeollanam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Train] <br>\nTake a train to Baegyangsa Station from Yongsan Station (Seoul).<br>\nTake a taxi to Bangjangsan Recreational Forest from Baegyangsa Station.\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-01-1659393685811","title":"Bangjangsan National Recreational Forest (Íµ≠Î¶Ω Î∞©Ïû•ÏÇ∞ÏûêÏó∞Ìú¥ÏñëÎ¶º)","description":"Situated between Jeollanam-do and Jeollabuk-do, Bangjangsan National Recreational Forest is the highest rising peak along the ridge starting from the west of Naejangsan Mountain.
