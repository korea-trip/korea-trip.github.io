The name comes from its appearance in relation to Boeunsan Mountain in Ganjin-eup, which looks like&nbsp;a cow‚Äôs head. The whole island resembles a cow‚Äôs meonge (curved stick around cow‚Äôs neck&nbsp;used to&nbsp;drag farming tool) so the island became to be called Gaudo Island (Ga  Meonge in Chinese characters). <br><br> From Gaudo Island, Gangjinman Bay and uninhabited island can be seen in all directions. The coastal scenery is stunning and varied natural tourism resources grow here such as the silver magnolia, cypress colony, and Japanese black pines. Visitors can walk to the island from the mainland via a suspension bridge. When arriving to the island, a 2.5km long ecological exploring road along the mountain and coast is available. Also, fishing park which has various kinds of&nbsp;fishes is located in the spot where visitors can overlook&nbsp;at beautiful scenery of Gangjinman Bay. At the top of the island, visitors can enjoy a zip track which is an eco-friendly leisure facility, starting from Cheongja Tower (25m high).","regDate":"2023-01-19","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollanam-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-19-1674124713738/2483137_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollanam-do/2023-01-19-1674124713738"},{"id":"2023-01-19-1674120976924","title":"Gatbawi Culture Town (Í∞ìÎ∞îÏúÑ Î¨∏ÌôîÌÉÄÏö¥)","description":"Gatbawi Culture Town is the prime tourist attraction in Mokpo, comprised of Gatbawi Rock, Mokpo Culture & Arts Center, Mokpo Natural History Museum, National Maritime Museum, Namnong Memorial Hall and other culture and art facilities.

It is also home to beautiful mountains, rivers, and plains that add to its scenic beauty and natural features. The Baengnyeonsa Temple and Dasan Chodang to the west of Gangjinman Bay, and the reeds along the coastline are a beautiful sight to behold. Also, the National Highway No. 23 that runs along the eastern border of the Gangjinman Bay, past the town of Gangjin-eup to Maryang, is famous for its many spectacular sights. Above all, it is highly recommended to hike up the Cheonilgak Pavilion in front of the Dasan Chodong Dongam (east hermitage) for a panoramic view of Gugangpo‚Äôs coastal waters. The hiking trail that traverses Mandeoksan Mountain leads to Baengnyeonsa, which is a temple with breathtaking ocean view.","regDate":"2023-01-19","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollanam-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-19-1674117534650/220619_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollanam-do/2023-01-19-1674117534650"},{"id":"2023-01-19-1674113779757","title":"Gangjin Goryeo Celadon Kiln Site (Í∞ïÏßÑ Í≥†Î†§Ï≤≠Ïûê ÏöîÏßÄ)","description":"Daegu-myeon of Gangjin-gun was the primary site of Goryeo dynasty celadon production between the 9th and the 14th centuries.

The area‚Äôs big temperature difference between day and night and the frequent thick fog provide ideal conditions for tea cultivation. The tea cultivated at Gangjin Dawon has a strong scent and rarely tastes bitter. Gangjin Dawon is the home of the nation‚Äôs first green tea product ‚ÄúBaegunokpancha.‚Äù Since 1980, an extensive area of mountainous territory has been cultivated for green tea production to become the more than 80 acres of green tea fields that it is today. As Gangjin Dawon is relatively lesser known than the green tea fields in Boseong, visitors can enjoy a relaxing time surrounded by the vastness of the green tea fields. Nearby attractions include Baengnyeonsa Temple, the Birthplace of Yeongnang, Gangjin Goryeo Cheongja kiln site, and Dasan Chodang, the house where the famous scholar Dasan Jeong Yak-yong (1762-1836) lived during his exile.","regDate":"2023-01-19","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollanam-do","Culture/Art/History","Experience Programs","Farming Experience"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-19-1674110421678/2648779_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollanam-do/2023-01-19-1674110421678"},{"id":"2023-01-19-1674106549364","title":"Gangjin Baengnyeonsa Temple (Î∞±Î†®ÏÇ¨ (Í∞ïÏßÑ))","description":"The original name of Baengnyeonsa Temple was Mandeoksa Temple, said to have been built by Preceptor Muyeom during the reign of Silla King Munseong. Later, Preceptor Wonmyo rebuilt it in the old site during the reign of King Huijong (7th year) during the Goryeo period. He gained fame as Baengnyeongyeolsa so the temple began to be called Baengnyeonsa Temple. Baengnyeongyeolsa has produced eight preceptors of Goryeo and flourished throughout 120 years. In addition, the area is famous as the place where Dasan Jeong Yak-yong and Master Hyejang connected and developed companionship regardless of religious and age differences during Jeong was exiled to Gangjin. <br><br> The temple‚Äôs most popular attraction is Forest of Common Camellias, designated as Natural Monument No. 151. The Camellia trees, skirting the road to the temple, make up a forest covering the area of 9,917 „é° over the ruined Haenghotoseong Earthen Fortification next to a memorial stone. In the forest, four stupas of Goryeo and Joseon Era are scattered like hide-and-seek. The forest features a tranquil ambience all year long even in daytime, thanks to the thick, green leaves. From November, the camellia flowers are in full bloom and the forest becomes red, beautiful enough to inspire visitors. After passing the forest on the way to Dasan Chodang, visitors can glimpse a colony of tea fields and wild tea produced by Baengnyeonsa Temple. The mountain where Baengnyeonsa Temple is situated has had wild tea fields grown from Goryeo Era so that it was called Dasan. For this reason, Jeong Yak-yong‚Äôs pen name is Dasan which holds the valuable meaning of his banishment here.","regDate":"2023-01-19","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollanam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-19-1674106549364/2434125_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollanam-do/2023-01-19-1674106549364"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
