From the summit, visitors can see waves of silver grass, a feature that makes the mountain popular for hiking. The mountain is also popular among hikers traveling by train as the entrance to the mountain is only 4 kilometers away from Gwangcheon Station. The biggest draw of the mountain, however, is the birds-eye-view of the west coast that comes into view on the way to the summit. Another attraction within the mountain range is Jeongamsa Temple.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-41-930-4060,<br>+82-41-930-0805, +82-41-936-5465|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Open 24 hr|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Admission applies to Oseosan National Recreational Forest|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-11-1668163541434/1602799_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668163541434/1602799_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-11-1668163541434/1602800_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668163541434/1602800_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-11-1668163541434/1602801_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668163541434/1602801_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-11-1668163541434/1602802_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668163541434/1602802_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-11-1668163541434/1602803_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668163541434/1602803_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-11-1668163541434/1602804_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668163541434/1602804_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-11-1668163541434/2675814_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668163541434/2675814_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-11-1668163541434/2675817_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668163541434/2675817_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-41-930-4060](tel:+82419304060)\n- [üè†www.brcn.go.kr](http://www.brcn.go.kr/tour.do)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.4561379434\nlongitude: 126.6542641018\ntitle: Seongyeon-ri, Boryeong-si, Chungcheongnam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Train + Bus]<br>\nTake the train from Yongsan Station to Gwangcheon Station. <br> From Gwangcheon Station, take a local bus to Oseosan Mountain Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-11-1668163541434","title":"Oseosan Mountain (Ïò§ÏÑúÏÇ∞)","description":"With an altitude of 790 meters, Oseosan Mountain in Boryeong is one of the highest peaks on Korea‚Äôs west coast.

The temple is easily accessble from downtown despite its location deep within a valley at the foot of Geumosan Mountain, serving as a landmark for visitors enjoying a light stroll or a hike up to the mountain. Serving as a home to several relics and a nine-story stone pagoda, the temple site and buildings are well maintained and neatly cleaned on a daily basis.  <br><br>According to legends, Monk Euigak originally had planned on building a temple in Sinam-myeon in Yesan. He went to China and brought a Buddha statue, praying earnestly on his way back aboard a boat. Upon his arrival, he sighted a pair of golden crows flying above the boat and followed the birds before they disappeared. He found the birds at the temples current location, drinking from a puddle of water that had an aromatic smell. From then on the mountain was called Geumosan, meaning the mountain of golden crow, and the temple was named Hyangcheonsa, meaning the temple of fragrant water.","regDate":"2022-11-18","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-18-1668768128450/1962103_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Chungcheongnam-do/2022-11-18-1668768128450"},{"id":"2022-11-18-1668764409764","title":"Yeonpo Beach (Ïó∞Ìè¨Ìï¥ÏàòÏöïÏû•)","description":"Located on the Taean Coast, Yeonpo Beach has been a popular vacation spot since 1972.
