The plantation is an eco-tourism destination that aims to contribute in reducing carbon dioxide and improve the local economy through green tea production. Despite the large field that covers an area of approx. 264,400 ㎡, Dosun Dawon Tea Plantation is not very well known among tourists. However, the plantation is frequented by photographers who visit to take snapshots of the vast field against the backdrop of Hallasan Mountain or Jeju's beautiful ocean.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-64-739-0419|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-19-1658252731994/2617707_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658252731994/2617707_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658252731994/2617709_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658252731994/2617709_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658252731994/2617710_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658252731994/2617710_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658252731994/2617711_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658252731994/2617711_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-64-739-0419](tel:+82647390419)\n- [🏠www.visitjeju.net](https://www.visitjeju.net/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.2724187254\nlongitude: 126.4829234611\ntitle: 152-41, Jungsanganseo-ro 356beon-gil, Seogwipo-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Taxi]<br>\nApprox. 15 min from Seogwipo Bus Terminal\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-19-1658252731994","title":"Dosun Dawon Tea Plantation (도순다원)","description":"Dosun Dawon Tea Plantation is Korea's first tea plantation to build and operate a modern tea-manufacturing factory.

It was originally a separate island, but a build-up of sand and soil has connected it to the main island.  A large crater, formed by the hot lava mixing with cold ocean water, is located at the top of Seongsan Ilchulbong Tuff Cone. The crater is about 600 meters in diameter and 90 meters deep. It has been featured in films, and was originally used for agriculture, but has now been given over to a field of silver grass. From the summit, visitors can see Udo Island, as well as take in the magnificent sunrise.
