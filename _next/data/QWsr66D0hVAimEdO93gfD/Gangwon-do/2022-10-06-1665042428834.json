Naksansa Temple is one of the foremost sights of Yangyang, and one of the most historic sites in the region. Along with Ganghwa‚Äôs Bomunsa Temple and Namhae‚Äôs Boriam Hermitage, it is said to be one of the three centers of the cult of Avalokitesvara in Korea. Its handsome view overlooking the East Sea has earned it a spot in the Eight Sights of Gwandong (eight famous sights in Yeongdong region of Gangwon-do), documented throughout the ages in many classic literature and poetry. Today‚Äôs Naksansa Temple is a product of many restorations and expansions, and has many examples of cultural heritage within its walls. There is a 16 meter-tall statue of the Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva to Uisangdae, a pavilion built to overlook the sunrise over the East Sea on a coastal cliff, Hongnyeonam Hermitage, built over the crashing waves, Seven-story Stone Pagoda of Naksansa Temple, Yangyang (Treasure No. 499), a Joseon-era pagoda with Goryeo-era style, and Stupa, Stele, and Reliquaries of Naksansa Temple, Yangyang (Treasure No. 1723), including a number of sarira.

The beach is particularly known for its soft and fine sand, often considered to be the best on the east coast. Despite its excellent scenery and clear water, the beach is relatively obscure and peaceful. It is only open during the daytime between July and August. The pine trees surrounding the beach are protected areas, and visitors are prohibited from entering. Surfing is another draw of the beach, and the surf shop offers lessons and equipment rentals. Scuba diving is also available on site. An interesting insight into the folk tradition is ‚Äúanchovy flinging,‚Äù a traditional method of catching anchovies that involve about 70 people working together to pull a big net from the sea to land. This experience is offered free of charge during the opening of the beach, and requires payment for periods outside the vacation season. Prior reservation is required through the official website. The beach enjoys excellent access from Yangyang International Airport and a 20-min ride from Yangyang city center. Dongho-ri Beach Campground, Seoraksan Mountain, and Osaek District can be found nearby.","regDate":"2022-10-27","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-27-1666856392287/608515_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-27-1666856392287"},{"id":"2022-10-27-1666853444875","title":"Wonju Korea Ginseng Factory (ÏõêÏ£º Í≥†Î†§Ïù∏ÏÇºÏ∞Ω)","description":"Operated by the Korea Ginseng Corporation, the Korea Ginseng Factory makes high quality Korean ginseng.

When Taejo of Goryeo was surrounded by the army of Gyeon Hwon (founder of Later Baekje) at the Palgongsan Battle in Daegu, Sin exchanged armor with Taejo‚Äôs armor to disguise himself as the king and died. The enemy thought that he was Taejo and beheaded him, and Taejo made his head with gold in sorrow and held a funeral for him. The Tomb of Sin Sung-gyeom consists of three mounds, which are said to have been a measure that Taejo took lest the golden head should be stolen. The location of the tomb is regarded as one of the best propitious sites for a grave in Korea, based on geomancy. Surrounded by pine trees, this site overlooks downtown Chuncheon. The tombstone, shrine, and memorial stone were built around the tomb.

According to a legend, Monks Yeongseo, Hyewon, and Yeonok all had envisioned the location in their dreams in which a white-haired heavenly man appeared and indicated them the place of the temple. Thus, the temple was re-constructed at the current location and renamed as ‚ÄúSinheungsa,‚Äù meaning ‚Äúthe temple was blessed by God (sin) and became prosper (heung). However, the Chinese character sin of the temple‚Äôs name was changed in 1995 from sin meaning god to sin meaning ‚Äúnew,‚Äù wishing that the temple will revive Buddhism again in the Yeongdong area (eastern part of the Taebaek Mountain Range). Sinheungsa Temple is home to many cultural heritages including the Geungnakbojeon Hall at Sinheungsa Temple (Treasure) and the Three-story Stone Pagoda at Hyangseongsa Temple Site (Treasure), which is standing on the opposite side of Kensington Star Hotel .

Daecheongbong Peak (1,708 m) is the third highest peak in Korea after Hallasan Mountain and Jirisan Mountain, and as the peak is covered with snow for five to six months of the year, the mountain got the name Seorak (meaning a snowy peak). The summit of Daecheongbong Peak commands the magnificent natural landscape of Seoraksan Mountain and the East Sea. In particular, it is known for the fantastic views of the sunrise and sunset. In addition to Daecheongbong Peak, Seoraksan Mountain has some 30 grand peaks, such as Socheongbong, Hwachaebong, and Jungcheongbong.

Its ridges are populated by Siberian dwarf pine, Hairy Korean rhododendron, Ermans birch, and subalpine trees, making it a valuable source for alpine plant research. Four trails in the Seoraksan National Park take the visitors to this peak, through Osaek, Baekdam, Seorak-dong, and Osaengnyeong (Hangyeryeong) Pass. The shortest trail is the 5 km-long Osaek Trail (Osaek ‚Äì Seorak Falls ‚Äì Daecheongbong Peak), taking about 4 hr in total.
