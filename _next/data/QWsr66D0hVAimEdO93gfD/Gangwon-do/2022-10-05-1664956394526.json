The communist Chinese army launched a major offensive attack for 10 days on October 6, 1952 during the Battle of Baengmagoji, which can be translated into the Battle of White Horse Highlands. Due to this battle, the communist Chinese army suffered around 14,000 casualties and the army completely collapsed while the 9th Infantry Division won the Battle of Baengmagoji and got the nickname “White Horse.” <br><br>After the battle, the area gave off a bad smell because of the dead bodies. The mountain area lost its original shape due to the severe battle and as a result the area was named “Baengmagoji” as it was said to resemble a white horse (baengma) lying down.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-33-450-5559|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Tour Course Information:|Baengma Station - Daema-ri Guard Post - The 2nd Tunnel - Peace Observatory - Woljeong-ri Station - Labor Party Office - Baengma Station|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Memorial Hall of Baengmagoji Battle, Monument for Baengmagoji Battle, Memorial Stone for Baengmagoji Battle, etc. |\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-10-05-1664956394526/2494536_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-05-1664956394526/2494536_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-05-1664956394526/2494537_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-05-1664956394526/2494537_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-05-1664956394526/2494538_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-05-1664956394526/2494538_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-05-1664956394526/2494539_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-05-1664956394526/2494539_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-05-1664956394526/2494540_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-05-1664956394526/2494540_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-05-1664956394526/2494541_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-05-1664956394526/2494541_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-05-1664956394526/2494542_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-05-1664956394526/2494542_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-05-1664956394526/2494545_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-05-1664956394526/2494545_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-33-450-5559](tel:+82334505559)\n- [🏠www.cwg.go.kr</a> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br><a href=\"http://hantan.cwg.go.kr\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"new window popup\" class=\"web\">hantan.cwg.go.kr](http://www.cwg.go.kr/site/tour/main.do)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 38.2700172415\nlongitude: 127.1652863536\ntitle: 72, Daema 1-gil, Cheorwon-gun, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Train + Taxi]<br>\nBaengmagoji Station (Gyeongwon Line) <br>Take a taxi for approx, 4 min. to the venue.\n","data":{"id":"2022-10-05-1664956394526","title":"Memorial Tower of Baengmagoji Battlefield and Memorial Museum (백마고지 위령비와 기념관)","description":"Located in the northern area of South Korea, Baengmagoji Battlefield was one of the bloodiest battlefields during the Korean War.

It is 500 meters in length and 55 meters in x_width, and has an average depth of 1.2 meters. The beach is particularly known for its soft and fine sand, often considered to be the best on the east coast. Despite its excellent scenery and clear water, the beach is relatively obscure and peaceful. It is only open during the daytime between July and August. The pine trees surrounding the beach are protected areas, and visitors are prohibited from entering. Surfing is another draw of the beach, and the surf shop offers lessons and equipment rentals. Scuba diving is also available on site. An interesting insight into the folk tradition is “anchovy flinging,” a traditional method of catching anchovies that involve about 70 people working together to pull a big net from the sea to land. This experience is offered free of charge during the opening of the beach, and requires payment for periods outside the vacation season. Prior reservation is required through the official website. The beach enjoys excellent access from Yangyang International Airport and a 20-min ride from Yangyang city center. Dongho-ri Beach Campground, Seoraksan Mountain, and Osaek District can be found nearby.","regDate":"2022-10-27","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-27-1666856392287/608515_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-27-1666856392287"},{"id":"2022-10-27-1666853444875","title":"Wonju Korea Ginseng Factory (원주 고려인삼창)","description":"Operated by the Korea Ginseng Corporation, the Korea Ginseng Factory makes high quality Korean ginseng.

When Taejo of Goryeo was surrounded by the army of Gyeon Hwon (founder of Later Baekje) at the Palgongsan Battle in Daegu, Sin exchanged armor with Taejo’s armor to disguise himself as the king and died. The enemy thought that he was Taejo and beheaded him, and Taejo made his head with gold in sorrow and held a funeral for him. The Tomb of Sin Sung-gyeom consists of three mounds, which are said to have been a measure that Taejo took lest the golden head should be stolen. The location of the tomb is regarded as one of the best propitious sites for a grave in Korea, based on geomancy. Surrounded by pine trees, this site overlooks downtown Chuncheon. The tombstone, shrine, and memorial stone were built around the tomb. This tomb was designated as Gangwon-do Monument No. 21 under the title “Sin jangjeolgong Myoyeok (Tomb of Sin Sung-gyeom),” while the memorial stone, bearing the story of the Palgongsan Battle and Sin Sung-gyeom’s performance, was designated as Gangwon-do’ Tangible Cultural Heritage No. 155.","regDate":"2022-10-27","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-27-1666849629456/182077_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-27-1666849629456"},{"id":"2022-10-27-1666847343609","title":"Sinheungsa Temple (신흥사(설악산))","description":"Sinheungsa Temple was founded under the name of Hyangseongsa Temple by Buddhist monk Jajang during the reign of Queen Jindeok of the Silla dynasty. It was first established at the site of Kensington Hotel, but after being destroyed by fire several times, it was rebuilt at the present position during the reign of King Injo of the Joseon dynasty. According to a legend, Monks Yeongseo, Hyewon, and Yeonok all had envisioned the location in their dreams in which a white-haired heavenly man appeared and indicated them the place of the temple. Thus, the temple was re-constructed at the current location and renamed as “Sinheungsa,” meaning “the temple was blessed by God (sin) and became prosper (heung). However, the Chinese character sin of the temple’s name was changed in 1995 from sin meaning god to sin meaning “new,” wishing that the temple will revive Buddhism again in the Yeongdong area (eastern part of the Taebaek Mountain Range). Sinheungsa Temple is home to many cultural heritages including the Geungnakbojeon Hall at Sinheungsa Temple (Treasure) and the Three-story Stone Pagoda at Hyangseongsa Temple Site (Treasure), which is standing on the opposite side of Kensington Star Hotel . The temple also offers the temple stay program in which participants can experience a temple life by doing activities such as communal Buddhist meal service (baru gongyang), ceremonial service involving chanting, 108 bows aimed at removing 108 earthly desires, as well as programs of making a lotus lantern and Buddhist rosary.","regDate":"2022-10-27","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-27-1666847343609/166406_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-27-1666847343609"},{"id":"2022-10-26-1666781111969","title":"Seungilgyo Bridge (승일교)","description":"Seungilgyo Bridge is unique in that it was jointly built by South and North Korea.

It is also the origin of most of Seoraksan Mountain’s famous valleys, like Cheonbuldong and Gayadong Valleys. Because of erratic weather and low temperature, Daecheongbong Peak is often covered in snow from late October to late spring. Its ridges are populated by Siberian dwarf pine, Hairy Korean rhododendron, Ermans birch, and subalpine trees, making it a valuable source for alpine plant research. Four trails in the Seoraksan National Park take the visitors to this peak, through Osaek, Baekdam, Seorak-dong, and Osaengnyeong (Hangyeryeong) Pass. The shortest trail is the 5 km-long Osaek Trail (Osaek – Seorak Falls – Daecheongbong Peak), taking about 4 hr in total.
