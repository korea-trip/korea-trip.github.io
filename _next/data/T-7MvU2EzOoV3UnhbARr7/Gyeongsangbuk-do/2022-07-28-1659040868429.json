The exhibition center invites visitors to sample various  fermented soybean condiments and displays all the products made in this village.

With the construction of Sudo Bridge, the Single Log Bridge was no longer needed, but was rebuilt some time later in its original form. To celebrate the bridge‚Äôs impressive history, the village hosts the Single-Log Bridge Festival every October.","regDate":"2022-12-10","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Folk Villages"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-10-1670654386426/2563076_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-10-1670654386426"},{"id":"2022-12-10-1670650568186","title":"Yeongju Huibangsa Temple (Ìù¨Î∞©ÏÇ¨(ÏòÅÏ£º))","description":"Four kilometers northeast of Huibang Station is Huibangsa Temple, which is located at the foot of Sobaeksan Mountain.
