Highlights of the village include a red clay storage room capable of storing around 100 tons of soybeans, a giant iron pot for boiling up to 100 kilograms of beans at once, and a large glass drying room used for hanging meju (fermented soybean blocks) to dry. Using these features, doenjang is made by boiling domestically produced soybeans and shaping them into blocks of meju, which are then left to ferment and dry for 2 to 3 months. <br><br>The village facilities are comprised of an exhibition center at the entrance, a production center, and two drying rooms. The exhibition center invites visitors to sample various  fermented soybean condiments and displays all the products made in this village.

It is a tiny bridge in terms of x_width (30 cm), but it stretches for over 150 meters. It is said that the bridge was rebuilt annually after being destroyed each rainy season. With the construction of Sudo Bridge, the Single Log Bridge was no longer needed, but was rebuilt some time later in its original form. To celebrate the bridge‚Äôs impressive history, the village hosts the Single-Log Bridge Festival every October.","regDate":"2022-12-10","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Folk Villages"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-10-1670654386426/2563076_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-10-1670654386426"},{"id":"2022-12-10-1670650568186","title":"Yeongju Huibangsa Temple (Ìù¨Î∞©ÏÇ¨(ÏòÅÏ£º))","description":"Four kilometers northeast of Huibang Station is Huibangsa Temple, which is located at the foot of Sobaeksan Mountain.
