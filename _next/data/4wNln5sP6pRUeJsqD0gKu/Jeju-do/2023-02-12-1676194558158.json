It was originally a separate island, but a build-up of sand and soil has connected it to the main island.  A large crater, formed by the hot lava mixing with cold ocean water, is located at the top of Seongsan Ilchulbong Tuff Cone. The crater is about 600 meters in diameter and 90 meters deep. It has been featured in films, and was originally used for agriculture, but has now been given over to a field of silver grass. From the summit, visitors can see Udo Island, as well as take in the magnificent sunrise. The tuff cone area was designated as a natural reserve on July 19, 2000.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <BR>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-64-710-7923|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|First Monday of every month|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00<BR>* Hours subject to change|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Shop, pergola, etc.|\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 5,000 won / Teenagers & Children 2,500 won<br />Groups - Adults 4,000 won / Teenagers & Children 2,000 won<br />* Free admission: Senior citizens (ages 65 and older), preschoolers (ages 6 and younger)<BR> * Groups: 10 people or more<br />* Adults (ages 25-64), Teenagers (ages 13-24), Children (ages 7-12)|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Available in Chinese|\n  \n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-64-710-7923](tel:+82647107923)\n- [🏠www.jeju.go.kr](http://www.jeju.go.kr/jejuwnh/index.htm)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.4581111174\nlongitude: 126.9415156012\ntitle: 284-12, Ilchul-ro, Seogwipo-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\n From Jeju Intercity Bus Terminal, take a Direct Bus bound for Seongsan and get off at Seongsalliipgu Bus Stop. <br>\nWalk for approx. 1 km.\n","data":{"id":"2023-02-12-1676194558158","title":"Seongsan Ilchulbong Tuff Cone [UNESCO World Heritage] (성산일출봉 [유네스코 세계문화유산])","description":"Seongsan Ilchulbong Tuff Cone rose 180 meters above sea level due to a magma flow under the sea over 5,000 years ago.

Seogwipo Submarine offers safe undersea tours in its recently acquired state of the art submarine from Finland. Munseom, where the submarine travels, is home to outstanding coral reefs, colorful schools of fish, and rich seaweed. The exquisite landscape makes it one of the most beautiful places to dive as well. Going deep into the 40 meter sea-bed, visitors can see countless fish, rare iridescent coral reefs, and a surreal-looking shipwreck with schools of fish surrounding it.

The park is located approximately 700 meters above sea level, and is 10 °C lower in average temperature compared to that of Seogwipo’s downtown, providing the ideal condition to enjoy forest bathing and camping from spring to fall. The park is easily accessible by car, thanks to the paved road from the mountain’s foothills all the way up to the park’s entrance. It takes about 30 minutes by car from Seogwipo’s downtown to the recreational park. The park is densely packed with trees and the air is filled with the refreshing forest scent, and even has a pebble walking trail suitable for a barefoot massage. The forest is equipped with amenities such as a mountain cottage, forest bathing site, campfire site, cooking area, and auto-camping site. Although the amenities serve to provide visitors’ convenience, they are minimized so as to prevent damage to the forest’s natural environment.","regDate":"2023-02-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Recreational Forests"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-12-1676176737273/1207811_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-12-1676176737273","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Jeju-do/2023-02-12-1676176737273"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
