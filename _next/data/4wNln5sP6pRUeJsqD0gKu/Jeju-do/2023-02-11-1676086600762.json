The myth describes how unlike other mountains on Jejudo Island, this mountain does not have a crater. The 5m-high rock cave at the cliff on the southwest side of the mountain was originally called Sanbanggul Cave, but it is called a temple now because it possesses a Buddhist statue.<br>This is where monk Hye-Il (964~1053) had lived during the Goryeo dynasty (918~1392)<br>Inside the cave, you can see Marado Island and the Dragon Head Coast. You can also see small ponds being made by the water drops that fall from the ceiling all through the year. The plant zone on a cliff of Sanbangsan Mountain is also designated as a natural monument. It is the only place on Jejudo Island where island boxwoods grow.  On the Dragon Head Coast is the Hamel Memorial Monument.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(English, Korean, Japanese, Chinese)<br>• For more info: +82-64-794-2940|\n|parking:|Available|\n|usetime:|sunrise-sunset|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|[Sanbanggul Cave]<BR>Individual: Adults 1,000 won / Children 500 won<BR>Groups: Adults 700 won / Children 400 won<BR><BR>[Sanbanggul Cave + Dragon Head Coast CombineTicket]<BR>Individual: Adults 2,500 won / Children 1,500 won <BR>Groups: Adults 2,000 won / Children 1,000 won<BR><BR>Free admission: Senior citizens (ages 65 & older), Preschoolers (ages 5 & younger)|\n|Parking Fees:|Public Parking Lot: Free<br>Private Parking Lot: Charged parking|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-02-11-1676086600762/1036476_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-11-1676086600762/1036476_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-11-1676086600762/1036494_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-11-1676086600762/1036494_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-11-1676086600762/1036495_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-11-1676086600762/1036495_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-11-1676086600762/1036528_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-11-1676086600762/1036528_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-11-1676086600762/1620190_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-11-1676086600762/1620190_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-11-1676086600762/1620191_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-11-1676086600762/1620191_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-11-1676086600762/1620192_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-11-1676086600762/1620192_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-11-1676086600762/1620193_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-11-1676086600762/1620193_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-11-1676086600762/1620194_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-11-1676086600762/1620194_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-64-794-2940](tel:+82647942940)\n- [🏠www.visitjeju.net](https://www.visitjeju.net/kr/detail/view?contentsid=CONT_000000000500287)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.2372949367\nlongitude: 126.3135722702\ntitle: Sanbang-ro, Seogwipo-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2023-02-11-1676086600762","title":"Sanbanggulsa Grotto - Jeju (산방굴사(제주))","description":"It is said that the peak of Hallasan Mountain where Baekrokho Lake now exists was taken off and thrown away, which then became Sanbangsan Mountain.
