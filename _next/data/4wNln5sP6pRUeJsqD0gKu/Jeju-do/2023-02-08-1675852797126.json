On top of the hill stands a beacon fire station, reaching 4 meters in x_height with a diameter of 9 meters, built using volcanic rocks. Behind the beacon fire station is Bulgeunoreum Volcanic Cone, vibrant with red soil. The white lighthouse atop the cone stands out in contrast.

It was originally a separate island, but a build-up of sand and soil has connected it to the main island.  A large crater, formed by the hot lava mixing with cold ocean water, is located at the top of Seongsan Ilchulbong Tuff Cone. The crater is about 600 meters in diameter and 90 meters deep. It has been featured in films, and was originally used for agriculture, but has now been given over to a field of silver grass. From the summit, visitors can see Udo Island, as well as take in the magnificent sunrise. The tuff cone area was designated as a natural reserve on July 19, 2000.","regDate":"2023-02-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Eco-Tourism Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-12-1676194558158"},{"id":"2023-02-12-1676191105346","title":"Seongeup Folk Village (ÏÑ±ÏùçÎØºÏÜçÎßàÏùÑ)","description":"Located at the foot of Halla Mountain on Jeju Island, Seongeup Folk Village is a small town that holds a vast amount of culture over a wide period of time from 1410 to 1914.

The exquisite landscape makes it one of the most beautiful places to dive as well. Going deep into the 40 meter sea-bed, visitors can see countless fish, rare iridescent coral reefs, and a surreal-looking shipwreck with schools of fish surrounding it. Over 20 years of technical knowhow and safe operation (in fact, the longest submarine tour without a single accident on record) make Seogwipo Submarine a must-see attraction on Jeju Island.","regDate":"2023-02-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Cruises/Submarines"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-12-1676180133673/1618776_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-12-1676180133673"},{"id":"2023-02-12-1676176737273","title":"Seogwipo Recreational Forest (ÏÑúÍ∑ÄÌè¨ÏûêÏó∞Ìú¥ÏñëÎ¶º)","description":"Seogwipo Recreational Forest is Korea‚Äôs southernmost recreational park that serves as an excellent nature getaway by preserving the mountain‚Äôs forest environment and ecosystem while minimalizing manmade structures as much as possible.
