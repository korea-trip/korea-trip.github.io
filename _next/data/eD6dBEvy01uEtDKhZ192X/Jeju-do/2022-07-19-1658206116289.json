From Darangswi Oreum, visitors can overlook tourist attractions such as Seongsan Ilchulbong (Sunrise Peak), Udo Island, Hallasan Mountain, coastlines, and various parasitic cones.<br><br>The mountain has an oval shape from south to north with a steep incline. The top has a large, deep funnel-shaped crater that still preserves its original shape unlike craters in cones. The name Darangswi is derived from the fact that the mountain looks like a moon ('Da' meaning 'Moon' and 'Swi' meaning 'Mountain' in the Jeju dialect).<br><br>Trees are scattered here and there at the top, and the outskirts of the mountain are decorated with cedar trees. Meadow plants such as Aster yomena populate most of the mountain. A gentle hill to the right of Darangswi Oreum is called Akkeun Darangswi Oreum (also called Sowol Nangak). Meaning 'small,' 'Akkeun' is both old Korean and Jeju dialect.<br><br>Darangswi Oreum hosts Wollang Peak Sunrise Festival every year allowing visitors to see the spectacular full moon from the crater. There are wooden stairs in place for easy ascent, and the mountain is also a popular site for paragliders.","regDate":"2022-07-19","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-19-1658245342348/2652528_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2022-07-19-1658245342348"},{"id":"2022-07-19-1658241314969","title":"Daheeyeon Garden (다희연)","description":"Daheeyeon Garden is a major tea farm on Jeju Island, which has the best conditions for growing great tea in a natural environment.

At the base of this cliff is the Jisatgae Coast along with the imposing stone pillars. Jusangjeolli are stone pillars piled up along the coast and is a designated cultural monument of Jeju Island. Jusangjeolli Cliff was formed when the lava from Hallasan Mountain erupted into the sea of Jungmun. They are rock pillars shaped like cubes or hexagons of various sizes and almost seem as if stone masons had carved them out. The administration of the district named them 'Jisatgae Rocks' from their old name 'Jisatgae'. The 20m cliff makes it a popular spot for high tide and sea angling. The waves of the high tide crashing into the side of the cliff provide a breathtaking view of the ocean surrounding the pillars.","regDate":"2022-07-19","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-19-1658238893407/197693_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2022-07-19-1658238893407"},{"id":"2022-07-19-1658236093306","title":"Daejeonghyanggyo Confucian School (대정향교)","description":"Daejeonghyanggyo was a Confucian school during Joseon Dynasty.
