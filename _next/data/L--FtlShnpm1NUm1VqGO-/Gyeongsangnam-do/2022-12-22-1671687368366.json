It is also known as the “mystical valley” as crystal clear water flows all year round. The word “Sogeumgang” is distinctly engraved on one side of the cliff and large rocks stand in layers throughout the valley. Some of the rocks are called Byeongpungbawi Rock, literally meaning folding screen rocks, as they are stretched out much like folding screens. <br><br>The valley and the surrounding mountains are a popular summer vacation spot and a well-known hiking destination during the spring, fall, and winter.
