Its current name, meaning to be adorned with silk for eternity, was bestowed upon the mountain by King Taejo in honor of the mountains spiritual powers, which he believed had listened to his 100-day prayer and consequently helped him rise to the throne as the first king of Joseon. Although the mountain is known to have the largest volume of granite rocks in the archipelago, the mountains rich soil made it a home to the largest colony of deciduous trees on the southern coast. Boriam Hermitage, known to be one of the three holiest Buddhist prayer sites, is also on Geumsan Mountain.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-1588-3415|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Areas Open to the Public:|Geumsan Entrance ~ Mountain peak<br>Neukdo Parking Lot ~ Keunseomsan Mountain<br>Bokgokje Parking Lot 2 ~ Sangsaam Hermitage ~ Ssanghongmun Gate<br>Geumsan Entrance ~ Geumsan Entrance<br>Busoam Hermitage ~ Yi Taejo Prayer Hall<br>Choyang Rest Area ~ Choyangdo Island<br>Iraksa Temple Entrance ~ Cheommangdae Observatory<br>Nodo Village ~ Kim Man-jung Archive Hall|\n|Mountain Not Access Period:|Seasonal Forest Fire Watches<br>Spring: March 2-April 30 <br>Autumn: November 1-December 15<brNational Park: November 15-December 15 (Excluding Gyeongju and Taean)<br>* Periods and areas are subject to change based on fire weather advisories, snow/precipitation levels, and other local conditions.|\n|Parking Fees:|Compact vehicles 2,000 won<br>Mid-size vehicles 4,000-5,000 won<br> Large vehicles 6,000-7,500 won<br>* Regular buses are free (excluding regular parking)|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-17-1671248153231/1293044_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-17-1671248153231/1293044_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-17-1671248153231/1293054_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-17-1671248153231/1293054_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-17-1671248153231/1293081_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-17-1671248153231/1293081_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-17-1671248153231/1293124_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-17-1671248153231/1293124_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-17-1671248153231/1293229_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-17-1671248153231/1293229_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-17-1671248153231/1293412_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-17-1671248153231/1293412_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-17-1671248153231/1293434_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-17-1671248153231/1293434_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-17-1671248153231/1293462_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-17-1671248153231/1293462_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-17-1671248153231/1293491_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-17-1671248153231/1293491_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-17-1671248153231/1293042_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-17-1671248153231/1293042_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-1588-3415](tel:+8215883415)\n- [üè†hallyeo.knps.or.kr](http://hallyeo.knps.or.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 34.7559871572\nlongitude: 127.9837683422\ntitle: Sangju-myeon, Namhae-gun, Gyeongsangnam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Taxi]<br>\nFrom Sacheon Bus Terminal, take a taxi for approx. 1 hr.\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-17-1671248153231","title":"Geumsan Mountain (Í∏àÏÇ∞ (ÎÇ®Ìï¥))","description":"As home to Bogwangsa Temple founded by Monk Wonhyo, Geumsan Mountain was originally called Bogwangsan.
