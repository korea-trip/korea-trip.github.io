The fortress was the scene of many hard-fought battles including the invasions of America and Japan in the 1870s. The site was then taken by the foreign troops due to the inferior fighting power of the Korean military, and very nearly completely destroyed. In 1876 (13th year of King Gojong), the Japanese warship Unyangho invaded and forced the Joseon Kingdom to open their ports, which later led to the forced signing of the Jana-Korea Treaty of 1876. Only the base of the fortress and the site of the high ground remained until 1973, when restoration work was started. The patriotic spirit of the Joseon dynasty still remains in this historic site.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-32-930-7072|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Admission Fees:| Individuals: Adults 700 won / Teenagers & Children 500 wonGroups: Adults 600 won / Teenagers & Children 400 won<br> <br> * Groups: 20 people or more<br> * Free admission: Preschoolers (ages 6 or younger) accompanied by a guardian, Senior citizens (ages 65 or older)<br><BR> * Ganghwa-gun Main Tourism Sites Discount (up to 20% discount)<br> Main tourism site: Chojijin Fortress, Deokjinjin Fortress, Gwangseongbo Fortress, Gapgotdon Watchtower, Goryeogung Palace Site, Peace Observatory, Hwamunseok Cultural Center, Museum, Manisan Mountain, Mudflat Center, and Hamheodongcheon Stream<br><br>- 15% discount: 3-4 sites<br>- 20% discount: 5 or more sites<br> * When choosing 8 sites or more, the ticket is valid until the next day|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-10-1660131384858/1577833_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-10-1660131384858/1577833_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-10-1660131384858/1577835_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-10-1660131384858/1577835_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-10-1660131384858/1577836_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-10-1660131384858/1577836_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-10-1660131384858/1577837_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-10-1660131384858/1577837_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-10-1660131384858/1577838_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-10-1660131384858/1577838_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-10-1660131384858/1577839_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-10-1660131384858/1577839_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-10-1660131384858/2003413_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-10-1660131384858/2003413_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-32-930-7072](tel:+82329307072)\n- [üè†www.ghss.or.kr](http://www.ghss.or.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.6326163996\nlongitude: 126.5322543599\ntitle: 58, Haeandong-ro, Ganghwa-gun, Incheon\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway + Bus] <BR>\nSinchon Station (Seoul Subway Line 2), Exit 4.<br>Walk straight 260 m to the bus stop in front of Artreon and take Bus No. 3000 to Ganghwa Bus Terminal.\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-10-1660131384858","title":"Ganghwa Chojijin Fortress (Í∞ïÌôî Ï¥àÏßÄÏßÑ)","description":"Chojijin Fortress is believed to have been built in 1655 (6th year of King Hyojong) for the purpose of national defense against coastal attacks from foreign enemies based on articles regarding the construction of Chojijin Fortress.

The fortress was built in 1656 and the outpost was constructed in 1679. It was completely remodeled into a masonry castle with gates in 1745. During Sinmiyangyo (the American invasion in 1871), Gwangseongbo was the fiercest battle ground in Ganghwa. On April 24, 1871, a  fleet with 1,230 American naval forces led by Rear Admiral John Rodgers landed on Ganghwado Island to demand the opening of Korea's ports and commerce. The armed forces attacked Chojijin Fortress and Deokjinjin Camp, then marched to Gwangseongbo Fortress, where they engaged in close combat with the warriors of Joseon. Although General Eo Jae-yeon and the other warriors were poorly equipped with far inferior weapons, they bravely fought to the death against the invading forces. <br><br>The battlefield ruins of the fortress and the gate towers such as Anhaeru, Gwangseongdon, Sondolmokdon, and Yongdudon were repaired in 1977.  The twin tombs of General Eo Jae-Yeon and his brother Eo Jae-seon, along with the anonymous tombs of warriors who died on the battlefield were also honorably arranged at the same time. Furthermore, a stone monument commemorating the restoration of Ganghwa Battlefield was erected on Yongdudondae Post. <br><br>In 1988, an extensive rest area was created toward the shore for visitors‚Äô convenience. Gwangseongbo Fortress is presently designated as Historical Relic No. 227. A religious service known as Gwangseongje is held annually to commemorate the patriotic spirits of General Eo Jae-yeon and other unnamed warriors. This service takes place at 11 a.m. on every April 24th of the lunar calendar.","regDate":"2022-08-11","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-11-1660196262031/2363682_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-08-11-1660196262031"},{"id":"2022-08-11-1660193458113","title":"Gureopdo Island (Íµ¥ÏóÖÎèÑ)","description":"Gureopdo Island is considered the Galapagos of Korea.
