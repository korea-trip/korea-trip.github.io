The 2nd King Namhae (AD 4~24) impressed by Seoktalhae‚Äôs actions, took him in as his son-in-law, later, becoming the 4th king.  The area was then under Silla‚Äôs rule for 900 years, the last king being the 56th, Gyeongsoon (AD 927~935).  <br><br>Although the magnificent grandeur of the palace is now just an empty lot, it has been told that this area was filled with imperial buildings during the Silla dynasty.  Currently, the region of Wolseong has a freezer made out of rocks called Seokbinggo, an archery range, horse-riding field, and a traditional playground, which resembles the grounds of the Joseon Period (the dynasty that ruled the Korean peninsula from 1392-1910).","regDate":"2022-11-29","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Fortresses"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-29-1669718411779/2601687_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-11-29-1669718411779"},{"id":"2022-11-29-1669711353031","title":"Gyeongju Tomb of King Muyeol, Stele of King Taejong Muyeol (Í≤ΩÏ£º Î¨¥Ïó¥ÏôïÎ¶â, ÌÉúÏ¢ÖÎ¨¥Ïó¥ÏôïÎ¶âÎπÑ)","description":"The Tomb of King Muyeol is the tomb of Kim Chun-chu, who acsended to the throne as King Muyeol (r. 654-661), the 29th ruler of the Silla Kingdom.
