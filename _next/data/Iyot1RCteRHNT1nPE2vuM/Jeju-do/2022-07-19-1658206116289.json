The top has a large, deep funnel-shaped crater that still preserves its original shape unlike craters in cones. The name Darangswi is derived from the fact that the mountain looks like a moon ('Da' meaning 'Moon' and 'Swi' meaning 'Mountain' in the Jeju dialect).<br><br>Trees are scattered here and there at the top, and the outskirts of the mountain are decorated with cedar trees. Meadow plants such as Aster yomena populate most of the mountain. A gentle hill to the right of Darangswi Oreum is called Akkeun Darangswi Oreum (also called Sowol Nangak). Meaning 'small,' 'Akkeun' is both old Korean and Jeju dialect.<br><br>Darangswi Oreum hosts Wollang Peak Sunrise Festival every year allowing visitors to see the spectacular full moon from the crater. There are wooden stairs in place for easy ascent, and the mountain is also a popular site for paragliders.","regDate":"2022-07-19","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-19-1658245342348/2652528_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2022-07-19-1658245342348"},{"id":"2022-07-19-1658241314969","title":"Daheeyeon Garden (다희연)","description":"Daheeyeon Garden is a major tea farm on Jeju Island, which has the best conditions for growing great tea in a natural environment.
