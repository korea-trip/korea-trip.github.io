However, its buildings have been reconstructed as many as three times; once because of the Imjin War (1592-1598) and twice because of fire. The last fire took place in December of 1914, burning down all the buildings except Daeyangru Pavilion; therefore, most of the current buildings are historical representations of the buildings previously destroyed in the fire.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-55-853-0283|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-30-1659213531959/2372749_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659213531959/2372749_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659213531959/2372754_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659213531959/2372754_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659213531959/2372755_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659213531959/2372755_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659213531959/2372757_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659213531959/2372757_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659213531959/2372758_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659213531959/2372758_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-55-853-0283](tel:+82558530283)\n- [üè†www.dasolsa.kr](http://www.dasolsa.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.0831882320\nlongitude: 127.9199487926\ntitle: 417, Dasolsa-gil, Sacheon-si, Gyeongsangnam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Express/Intercity Bus]<br>\nTake a bus from Seoul Express Bus Terminal to Jinju Bus Terminal.<br><br>\n\n[Taxi]<br>\nApprox. 30 min from Jinju Bus Terminal.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-30-1659213531959","title":"Dasolsa Temple (Îã§ÏÜîÏÇ¨)","description":"Located on the hillside of Imyeongsan Mountain in Sacheon, Gyeongsangnam-do, Dasolsa Temple is a very old Buddhist temple built during the Silla dynasty.
