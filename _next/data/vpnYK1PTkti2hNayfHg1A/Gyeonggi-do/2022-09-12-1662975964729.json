{"pageProps":{"content":"![Yongmunsan Resort (용문산 관광지)](/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098983_image2_1.webp)\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> Yongmunsan Mountain in Yangpyeong, Gyeonggi-do, is comprised of Doilbong Peak, Baegunbong Peak, and other peaks. The resort shares the area with various cultural relics such as Yongmunsa Temple; Yongmunsa Temple’s gingko tree; a stupa containing a relic of the Buddha, a monument of the reverend monk Jeongji; and the Yongmunsan Mountain area’s war record monument. The resort area is frequented by visitors throughout all four seasons but is especially popular in the fall because of the yellow-tinged gingko tree of Yongmunsa Temple (a Natural Monument).  <br><br>\nA 2 kilometers trek through the valley from Yongmunsa Temple will bring you to Yonggakbawi Rock, shaped like a dragon’s horn, halfway up the mountain. 1km away from Yonggakbawi Rock lays a huge boulder, Court Rock, on which 100 people can easily sit at the same time. There is also an amusement park that provides great entertainment for children, consisting of a rapid ride, a Viking-boat, a merry-go-round, bumper cars, a family coaster, and other rides. <br><br>\nThirty minutes from Yongmunsa Temple is Jungwon Valley that looks small when seen from the outside, but leads to the mountain’s summit where you can enjoy a superb view. And only another fifteen minutes walk will bring you to the three-tiered Jungwon Falls where you can enjoy the sound of crashing waters and feel the cooling mists that rise from the base of the falls.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-31-773-0088|\n|parking:|Available (1,000 parking spaces)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Parking Fees:|Compact vehicles: 1,000 won / Mid-sized vehicles: 3,000 won / Buses: 5,000 won|\n|Available Facilities:|Museum, water fountain, foot-volleyball court, drinking fountain, basketball court, outdoor stage, playground, restaurant, etc.|\n|Admission Fees:|Indivuals: Adults 2,500 won / Teenagers 1,700 won / Children 1,000 won<BR>Groups: Adults 2,300 won / Teenagers 1,500 won / Children 800 won|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098793_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098793_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098798_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098798_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098860_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098860_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098874_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098874_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098933_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098933_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098976_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098976_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098784_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098784_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098806_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098806_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098813_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098813_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098816_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098816_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-31-773-0088](tel:+82317730088)\n- [🏠tour.yp21.net ](https://tour.yp21.go.kr/www/selectTourCntntsWebView.do?tourNo=173&key=69&ctgry=4)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5469452446\nlongitude: 127.5809612468\ntitle: Sinjeom-ri, Yangpyeong-gun, Gyeonggi-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-09-12-1662975964729","title":"Yongmunsan Resort (용문산 관광지)","description":"Yongmunsan Mountain in Yangpyeong, Gyeonggi-do, is comprised of Doilbong Peak, Baegunbong Peak, and other peaks.

The surrounding scenery of the Hantangang River area is truly breathtaking and is also the site of a famous amusement park. The Hantangang River Resort, located in the lower region of the Hantangang River, stretches along 1.5 kilometers of the river's shore between the Saranggyo Bridge and the Hantangyo Bridge in Jeongok-ri, Yeoncheon-gun. The Hantangang River flows from the Pyeonggang River in North Korea and through through Cheorwon, Pocheon and Yeoncheon and eventually joins the Imjingang River. The river features many scenic points including a large valley with cliffs that consist of many rare rocks. The resort is a great place for rest and relaxation, and has facilities for the whole family, maintaining campsites for cars and motor homes, a dinosaur-themed Children’s Character Park, Children’s Transportation Land, a water park, an ecological pond, and a soccer field.
