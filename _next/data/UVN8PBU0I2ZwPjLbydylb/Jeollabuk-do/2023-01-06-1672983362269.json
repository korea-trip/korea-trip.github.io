According to Samgukyusa (historical records published in 1281), King Mu (30th king of Baekje, in power AD 600-641) and his wife Queen Seonhwa were said to have seen a vision of Mireuksamjon (the three Sanskrit) emerging from a large pond. At the time of their revelation, the king and queen were on their way to visit a Buddhist monk in Sajasa Temple on Yonghwasan Mountain (now known as Mireuksan Mountain). In response to their vision, the king drained the nearby pond and established Mireuksa Temple. The temple is believed to have shown the most advanced architectural and cultural skills of Baekje, Silla, and Goguryeo (the three main kingdoms at that time). Records indicate that King Jinpyeong of Silla even sent his craftsmen over to assist with the temple construction. <br><br>The two main features of the Mireuksa Temple Site are the stone pagoda (Mireuksaji Seoktap) and the flagpole supports (Mireuksaji Dangganjiju). The 14.24-meter-high west stone pagoda (National Treasure No. 11) is the oldest and largest Korean stone pagoda in existence. The west pagoda currently has only six tiers, but is estimated to originally have had nine. The nine-story east stone pagoda (27.67 meters in x_height) was restored to its original stature in 1993 based on historical records. Other surviving landmarks include the flagpole supports (Treasure No. 236) to the south of the stone pagodas. The 395 centimeter-tall poles are estimated to have been created during the Unified Silla period (AD 676-935) and are set 90 meters apart from east to west.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-63-859-3873,<br> +82-63-830-0900|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|[Mireuksa Temple Site] N/A (Open all year round)<br>[Iksan National Museum] New Year‚Äôs Day, Mondays, the day of Seollal (Lunar New Year's Day) & Chuseok (Korean Thanksgiving Day)|\n|usetime:|[Mireuksa Temple Site] Open 24 hr<br>[Iksan National Museum] 10:00-17:30|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Information material available in English, Japanese and Chinese at the Exhibition Hall entrance|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-06-1672983362269/2514985_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-06-1672983362269/2514985_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-06-1672983362269/2514986_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-06-1672983362269/2514986_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-06-1672983362269/2514987_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-06-1672983362269/2514987_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-06-1672983362269/2514989_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-06-1672983362269/2514989_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-06-1672983362269/2514993_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-06-1672983362269/2514993_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-06-1672983362269/2514994_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-06-1672983362269/2514994_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-63-859-3873](tel:+82638593873)\n- [üè†www.iksan.go.kr/tour</a><br /><a href=\"http://iksan.museum.go.kr/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"web\">iksan.museum.go.kr](http://www.iksan.go.kr/tour/index.iksan)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.0125952250\nlongitude: 127.0308309191\ntitle: 362, Mireuksaji-ro, Iksan-si, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-06-1672983362269","title":"Mireuksa Temple Site [UNESCO World Heritage] (ÏùµÏÇ∞ ÎØ∏Î•µÏÇ¨ÏßÄ [Ïú†ÎÑ§Ïä§ÏΩî ÏÑ∏Í≥ÑÎ¨∏ÌôîÏú†ÏÇ∞])","description":"Mireuksa was the largest Buddhist temple of the ancient Baekje Kingdom (18 BC-AD 660).

The tunnel is approximately 3 meters in x_height and 10 meters in length, and divides the villages of Sindu Maeul into Dugil-ri, Seolcheon-myeon and Inam Maeul in Socheon-ri. During the Three Kingdoms Period, the rocky ridges of Seokgyeonsan Mountain drew the boundary of Sillas Mupung in the east with Baekjes Seolcheo to the west. <br>Tracing the history from the Three Kingdoms Period to the Goryeo dynasty, the cultures and traditions of the two regions were markedly different. If curious about the difference, one could simply stop by Seolcheon on market day, where the Muju and Mupung local dialects and customs can easily be distinguished. <br><br>People used to cross Seokgyeonsan Mountain by a footpath along the rocky ridge to travel between Seolcheon and Mupung. During the Japanese occupation, a new road was created by turning a cave into a tunnel through the mountain so cows and horse carts could freely pass from Muju to Gimcheon. <br><br>General Kim Yoo Shin from the Silla Kingdom, the hero of unification of the Three Kingdoms, often passed by the gate, later giving rise to the gates nickname, Tongilmun (literally Unification Gate). The gate is number one on the list of 33 scenic sites in Gucheon-dong.","regDate":"2023-01-08","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Nature","Natural Resources","Rocks"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-08-1673167020129/2366378_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-08-1673167020129"},{"id":"2023-01-08-1673163317005","title":"Omokdae and Imokdae Historic Sites (Ïò§Î™©ÎåÄÏôÄ Ïù¥Î™©ÎåÄ)","description":"Omokdae Historic Site is located on top of a steep hill and is one of the places where Yi Seong-gye, who later became King Taejo, the first king of the Joseon dynasty, stopped to celebrate his victory on his way home from a war against the Japanese army at Unbong Peak of Hwangsan Mountain. Across the bridge from Omokdae is Imokdae Historic Site, situated at the foot of Seungamsan Mountain. Approximately 80 meters downhill from Imokdae are memorial stones and a building where Mokjo, the great-great-grandfather of King Taejo, once used to live. The engraved letters on the stones are the handwritings of Emperor Gojong.
