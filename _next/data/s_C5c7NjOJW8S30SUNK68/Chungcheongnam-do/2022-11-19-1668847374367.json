It received a royal charter in 1660 and relocated to its current location in 1880 due to flooding problems. The academys main gate, Ipdeokmun Gate, is made up of three entrance doors. Once inside, Yangseongdang Hall can be seen facing the main gate, with Eungdodang Hall to the left. Ancestral rites take place every February and August at Jungjeong Hall. Inside the academy is a shrine that houses the ancestral tablets of four prominent scholars who taught at this institution - Kim Jang-saeng, Kim jip, Song Jun-gil, and Song Si-yeol. Among the academies that served Kim Jang-saeng and his teachings, Donamseowon is considered the most important and influencial.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-41-736-0096|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|January 1, Day of Seollal (Lunar New Year's Day) & Chuseok (Korean Thanksgiving Day)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Not available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-19-1668847374367/2620822_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-19-1668847374367/2620822_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-19-1668847374367/2620823_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-19-1668847374367/2620823_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-19-1668847374367/2620824_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-19-1668847374367/2620824_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-19-1668847374367/2620825_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-19-1668847374367/2620825_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-19-1668847374367/2620826_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-19-1668847374367/2620826_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-19-1668847374367/2620827_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-19-1668847374367/2620827_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-19-1668847374367/2620829_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-19-1668847374367/2620829_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-41-736-0096](tel:+82417360096)\n- [🏠www.donamseowon.co.kr</a> <br /><a href=\"http://www.nonsan.go.kr/tour/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"새창: 논산시 문화관광\">www.nonsan.go.kr</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.cha.go.kr/\" target=\"_blank\" >www.cha.go.kr](http://www.donamseowon.co.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.2087782194\nlongitude: 127.1808762055\ntitle: 26-14, Im 3-gil, Nonsan-si, Chungcheongnam-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-19-1668847374367","title":"Donamseowon Confucian Academy [UNESCO World Heritage] (돈암서원 [유네스코 세계문화유산])","description":"Donamseowon Confucian Academy was built in 1634, originally 1.5 kilometers away from its current location.

There are few existing records that mention the temple’s beginning. Some suggest that it was built around AD 527 during the 5th year of Baekje King Seongwang’s reign, but there is little evidence to support this theory. The only reference alluding to a specific time is Yeojidoseo (Detailed Survey of Korean Geography published during the late Joseon dynasty). It states Jeongamsa Temples location as on Oseosan Mountain, and Oseosan Mountain being surrounded by Hongsan Mountain and Baegwolsan Mountain and intersected by Hongju, Gyeolseong, and Boryeong. This indicates the temple was recognized in the mid-18th century and around the same time, Garamgo (a book about temples, published in the late 18th century) also states that Jeongamsa Temple is located approximately 11 kilometers to the east of Gyeolseonghyeon. It is still uncertain whether the temple referred to is Jeongamsa Temple on Oseosan Mountain. <br>Some foundation stones within the temple site measure 70-80 centimeters on each side. These stones indicate that the old Buddhist shrine of Jeongamsa Temple was laid out with five <em>kan</em> (Korean unit of measurement indicating the space between two pilars) at the front and three kan on the side. Future archaeological studies will help identify the true history of Jeongamsa Temple.","regDate":"2022-11-20","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Chungcheongnam-do/2022-11-20-1668919580082"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
