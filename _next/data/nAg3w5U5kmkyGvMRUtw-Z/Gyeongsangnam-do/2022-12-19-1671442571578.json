With a circumference of 30 meters, the pond is also called Sirye Hobakso Pond, Guyeongpokpo Falls, and Baengnyeonpokpo Falls. In the past, the pond was a spiritual place where people would pray for rain. Surrounded by white granite rocks, the area is a scenic place of natural beauty, free from pollution.
