{"pageProps":{"content":"![Baenaegol Valley (Î∞∞ÎÇ¥Í≥®)](/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228175_image2_1.webp)\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> Baenaegol Valley is located at the heart of the mountainous region affectionately known as the Yeongnam Alps. The valley derives its name ‚ÄúBaenaegol,‚Äù meaning ‚Äúthe valley of pears,‚Äù from the wild pear trees that grow in large numbers along the valley.<br><br>\n\nThe valley covers nearly 8 kilometers of land between the range connecting Sinbulsan Mountain and Yeongchuksan Mountain and the western range connecting Cheonhwangsan Mountain and Jaeyaksan Mountain in Miryang. It is a popular vacation destination in the summer. Also, many tourists come to drink the water containing acer mono sap, which is known to be produced in this region during the springtime.\n<br><br>\nBaenaegol Valley is just a short distance away from downtown Yangsan. The valley provides an opportunity to enjoy nature away from the hustle and bustle of the city center. The long valley is wedged between highlands, which results in at least two hours less of sunshine than other regions, so it feels cooler in the summer months. Strawberries are also widely grown in the area.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-55-382-4112|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228158_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228158_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228159_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228159_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228163_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228163_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228166_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228166_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228185_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228185_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228187_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659163505785/1228187_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-55-382-4112](tel:+82553824112)\n- [üè†www.yangsan.go.kr](http://www.yangsan.go.kr/tour)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.4564540524\nlongitude: 128.9660138589\ntitle: Wondong-myeon, Yangsan-si, Gyeongsangnam-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-30-1659163505785","title":"Baenaegol Valley (Î∞∞ÎÇ¥Í≥®)","description":"Baenaegol Valley is located at the heart of the mountainous region affectionately known as the Yeongnam Alps.

It is also dotted with seven waterfalls and 33 ponds. The hike becomes more difficult as the trail enters the valley. Because the valley has taken many lives, some people call it The Valley of Death. For that reason, visitors must apply in advance and hike with a guide. The trail in Chilseon Valley is a 9.4-kilometer course from Chuseong Village in Macheon-myeon to Cheonwangbong Peak, which does not follow the natural valley, due to the valleys steep and dangerous features.
