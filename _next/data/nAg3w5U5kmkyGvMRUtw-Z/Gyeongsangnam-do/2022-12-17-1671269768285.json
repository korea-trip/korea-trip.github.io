It was initially used by U.S. soldiers when a prisoner-of-war camp was established in Geoje in the aftermath of the Korean War. After the beach was opened to the public in the 1970s, it became better known for its natural beauty than its military history. The beach is relatively shallow with warm water and stretches 1.1 kilometers long and has a x_width of 30 meters. It has many nearby attractions such as Mangsan Mountain, Sujeongbong Peak, Anseom Island, and Yundolseom Island, creating a beautiful view.<br>Situated farther inland, partially encircled by the coastline, the water at Gujora Beach is calm and serene. A number of restaurants can be found nearby, mainly selling fresh <em>hoe</em> (sliced raw fish) as well as famous local produce such as anchovies and seaweed. Visitors can enjoy the nearby attractions such as Gujora Fortress as well as Haegeumgang, Naedo, and Oedo Islands by taking a cruise tour.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-55-639-4178|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Open 24 hr|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Shower booths, drinking fountain, camping site, etc.|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-17-1671269768285/583499_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-17-1671269768285/583499_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-17-1671269768285/583518_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-17-1671269768285/583518_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-17-1671269768285/747563_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-17-1671269768285/747563_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-17-1671269768285/747566_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-17-1671269768285/747566_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-55-639-4178](tel:+82556394178)\n- [üè†tour.geoje.go.kr](http://tour.geoje.go.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 34.8079772705\nlongitude: 128.6922330595\ntitle: 2056, Geoje-daero, Geoje-si, Gyeongsangnam-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-17-1671269768285","title":"Gujora Beach (Íµ¨Ï°∞ÎùºÌï¥ÏàòÏöïÏû•)","description":"Gujora Beach is not only known for its natural beauty and crystal clear water, but also as a beach that can be reached conveniently.
