Miller purchased the land in 1962 and starting in 1970, many trees were planted in earnest. At that time, the park was only open to experts in related fields and members who helped fund the arboretum. In 2009, select sections of the arboretum were finally opened to the general public. The arboretum features more than 13,200 plants, including holly, magnolia, camelia, and maple trees, as well as five varieties of Rose of Sharon, the national flower.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-41-672-9982|\n|opendate:|1979|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|November-March 09:00-17:00 / April-October 09:00-18:00<BR>Extended operation: Saturdays April 10 - May 22 09:00-19:00 / July 18 - August 15 09:00-19:00 <br>* Last admission 1 hr before closing|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Areas Open to the Public:|Miller Garden|\n|Shopping Information:|Holly Shop, Holly Cafe|\n|Facility Utilization Fees:|Refer to the official website|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Miller Garden, exhibition hall, Garden Stay, etc.|\n|Admission Fees:|March-November: Adults 9,000 won / Teenagers & senior citizens 6,000 won / Children 5,000 won<br>December-February: Adults 6,000 won / Teenagers & senior citizens 5,000 won / Children 4,000 won<br><br> * Adults (ages 19-64) / Children (ages 4-18) / Senior citizens (ages 65 and over) <br> * Group discount: 1,000 won discount for 30 people or more<BR>* Free admission: Preschoolers (ages 3 and under)|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-02-1667378919698/2653795_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-02-1667378919698/2653795_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-02-1667378919698/2653796_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-02-1667378919698/2653796_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-02-1667378919698/2653801_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-02-1667378919698/2653801_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-02-1667378919698/2653803_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-02-1667378919698/2653803_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-02-1667378919698/1649646_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-02-1667378919698/1649646_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-02-1667378919698/2653793_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-02-1667378919698/2653793_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-02-1667378919698/2653794_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-02-1667378919698/2653794_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-02-1667378919698/2653802_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-02-1667378919698/2653802_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-02-1667378919698/2653804_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-02-1667378919698/2653804_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-41-672-9982](tel:+82416729982)\n- [üè†www.chollipo.org](http://www.chollipo.org)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.7943735798\nlongitude: 126.1437513290\ntitle: 187, Cheollipo 1-gil, Taean-gun, Chungcheongnam-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-02-1667378919698","title":"Cheollipo Arboretum (Ï≤úÎ¶¨Ìè¨ÏàòÎ™©Ïõê)","description":"Cheollipo Arboretum is located on the tip of the Taean peninsula, and was founded by Carl Ferris Miller, the blue-eyed Korean.
