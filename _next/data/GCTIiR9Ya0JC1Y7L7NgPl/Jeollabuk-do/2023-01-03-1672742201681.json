Jeoksangsan, also called Red Skirt Mountain, got its name from the view of red maple trees around cliffs in fall that makes the mountain look like a giant red skirt. The mountain boasts a variety of attractions from Hyangnobong Peak (1,029 meters), Cheonilpokpo Falls, Songdaepokpo Falls, Jangdobawi Rock, Janggunbawi Rock, and Allyeomdae Cliff.<br><br>The rugged shape of the mountain was considered ideal for building a fortress. And after Jeoksangsan became a designated site for storing Joseonwangjo Sillok (annals of the Joseon Dynasty), the fortress surrounding it was further rebuilt. The mountain is also home to Anguksa Temple, an ancient temple built in 1227 (during the 3rd year of King Chungryeol‚Äôs reign) by Monk Wolin. The mountain can easily be climbed by hiking or by vehicle; there is a paved road stretching over 15 kilometers that leads to the top of the mountain thanks to the construction of Muju Power Plant, letting tourists visit Sanjeong Lake and Anguksa Temple conveniently.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-63-322-4174|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Mountain Not Access Period:|Seasonal Forest Fire Watches<br>Spring: March 2-April 30 <br>Autumn: November 1-December 15<brNational Park: November 15-December 15 (Excluding Gyeongju and Taean)<br>* Periods and areas are subject to change based on fire weather advisories, snow/precipitation levels, and other local conditions.|\n|Hiking Course:|Seochang Course (2 hours / 3.8 km): Seochang Park Office ‚Äì Three-way intersection ‚Äì Anguksa Temple<br>Chimok Course (2 hours / 3.7 km): Chimok ‚Äì Songdaepokpo Falls ‚Äì Anguksa Temple|\n|Restricted Mountain Areas :|Chimok ‚Äì Anguksa Temple (3.7 km)<br>Inwoldam ‚Äì Seolcheonbong Peak (5.1 km)<br>Hyangjeokbong Peak ‚Äì Yeonggak Park Ranger Office (17.5 km)<br>Baengyeonsa Temple ‚Äì Jungbong Peak (4.0 km)<br>Hoenggyeongjae Pass ‚Äì Sinpungnyeong Pass (7.8 km)<br>Songgyesa Temple ‚Äì Baegambong Peak (6.5 km)<br>Anseong Visitor Center ‚Äì Dongyeopryeong Pass (4.4 km)<br>Hoengjeom ‚Äì Weolseongjae Pass (2.6 km)<br>Yuksimnyeong Pass ‚Äì Namdeokyusan Mountain (3.6 km)<br>Byeonggok ‚Äì Dongyeomnyeong Pass (3.5 km)<br>Yangak ‚Äì Weolseongjae Pass (4.0 km)<br>Anguksan Mountain ‚Äì Nammunji (0.8 km)<br><br>[Summer Valley Closure Restricted Areas]<br>- Je2 Inweolgyo Bridge ‚Äì Baengnyeongsdam area<br>- Susimdae ‚Äì Pahoe ‚Äì Manjotan area<br>- Suseongdae area<br>- Hakseogyo Bridge ‚Äì Chilyeongyegok Valley area|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-03-1672742201681/1196420_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-03-1672742201681/1196420_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-03-1672742201681/1248420_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-03-1672742201681/1248420_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-03-1672742201681/1248429_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-03-1672742201681/1248429_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-03-1672742201681/1248431_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-03-1672742201681/1248431_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-03-1672742201681/2719975_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-03-1672742201681/2719975_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-03-1672742201681/2719976_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-03-1672742201681/2719976_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-03-1672742201681/2719977_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-03-1672742201681/2719977_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-63-322-4174](tel:+82633224174)\n- [üè†deogyu.knps.or.kr](http://deogyu.knps.or.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.9425120499\nlongitude: 127.6919628124\ntitle: Goemok-ri, Muju-gun, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-03-1672742201681","title":"Jeoksangsan Mountain (Ï†ÅÏÉÅÏÇ∞)","description":"As one of the best scenic mountains in Korea, Jeoksangsan Mountain (1,030.6 meters) showcases imposing, steep rock walls.

Tapsa Temple is famous for the over 80 stone pagodas built by Lee Gapyong, a retired scholar. Those stone pagodas have different sizes and shapes from cone-shaped to straight-shaped. Behind Daeungjeon, Cheonjitap tower is located. It is the largest tower, with a x_height 3 times as high as the average adult‚Äôs x_height. How this tall tower was built is still unclear, drawing much attention from people. It is said that those stone pagodas were made in the late 1800s entirely by Lee Gapyong alone. He collected stones in daytime and built the pagodas at night. Even though the pagodas have been around for more than 100 years, they have never collapsed nor even moved through strong winds, making them truly amazing.<br>Tapsa Temple is also well known for cherry blossoms in spring, covering an area of 1.9km from Nambu (south) parking lot of Maisan Mountain to the entrance (a 30min walk). This road is the venue for Maisan Cherry Blossom Festival as well. <br><br>* Cheonjitap is comprised of two twin pagodas with x_heights of 13.5m and placed in the south and north directions. Cheonjitap is the main pagoda, making the other pagodas at Tapsa Temple look well-balanced. It is believed that 120 towers originally existed, but only 80 of them remain today. The two towers at the very front are named Ilgwangtap and Wolgwangtap. These groups of towers are strong enough to stand up to typhoon winds, something quite hard to believe, giving the towers a certain mystery. Also, towers are tilted slightly in both directions, showing that Lee Gapyong erected the towers with the direction of the wind in mind.","regDate":"2023-01-10","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-10-1673325568605/1605767_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-10-1673325568605"},{"id":"2023-01-10-1673321782101","title":"Taekwondowon Observatory (ÌÉúÍ∂åÎèÑÍ≥µÏõê Ï†ÑÎßùÎåÄ)","description":"Taekwondowon located in Muju-gun, Jeollabuk-do, serves as a main center for the 60 million taekwondo practitioners in 182 countries worldwide.

In the third year of King Chungsuk of Goryeo (1316), the temple saw the addition of a five-story stone pagoda, built by Monk Deokhyeon. At its peak, the temple was said to have had 12 hermitages and housed 1,000 monks. It was burned down during the Imjin War (1592-1598), leaving only the pagoda, but was rebuilt a few years later by Monk Soyo during the 37th year of King Seonjo (1604). Unfortunately, the temple was burned down again in the Korean War, but was once again restored to its original state in 1959. <br><br>Cultural assets found at the temple include Stone Guardian Post of Chungsin-ri & Namgye-ri, Sunchang Guesthouse, and the Three-story Stone Pagoda of Sunhwa-ri. Nearby tourist attractions include Geumseongsanseong Fortress, Yongsopokpo Falls, Gangcheonho Lake, Damyangho Lake, Chuwolsan Mountain, Huimunsan Mountain, and Naejangsan National Park.","regDate":"2023-01-09","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-09-1673256950962/1954560_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-09-1673256950962"},{"id":"2023-01-09-1673253606161","title":"Sono Belle Byeonsan Ocean Play (ÏÜåÎÖ∏Î≤® Î≥ÄÏÇ∞ Ïò§ÏÖòÌîåÎ†àÏù¥)","description":"Sono Belle Byeonsan Ocean Play is located next to Gyeokpo Beach on Byeonsan Peninsula.
