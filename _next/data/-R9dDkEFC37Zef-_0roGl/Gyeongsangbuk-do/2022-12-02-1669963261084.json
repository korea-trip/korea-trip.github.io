The mountain is picturesque with its surroundings of dense forest, steep rocky areas, strangely shaped peaks and old trees. It has a grand scale of mountain ridge and high altitude. However, as the hiking trail starts at 529 meters on Ihwaryeong, it is not that tough. Nearby locations include Sinseongbong Peak and Mapaebong Peak, as well as Joryeongsan Recreational Forest.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-54-550-6414|\n|usetime:|Open all year round|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Hiking Course:|[Hiking Course]<br>Ihwaryeong Course: Ihwaryeong (1 hr) - Joryeongsaem (50 min) - Peak (1 hr 10 min) - Yongsagol - Wonteo - Juheulgwan <br><br>Saejae Course: Saejae Parking Lot (2 hr) - Joryeongsaem (50 min) - Peak (20 min) - Crossroads after 946 Goji (1 hr 10 min) - Madangbawi Rock in front of Wonteo|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-02-1669963261084/1958825_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-02-1669963261084/1958825_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-02-1669963261084/1958827_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-02-1669963261084/1958827_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-02-1669963261084/1958828_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-02-1669963261084/1958828_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-02-1669963261084/2005736_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-02-1669963261084/2005736_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-02-1669963261084/2005745_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-02-1669963261084/2005745_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-02-1669963261084/2005751_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-02-1669963261084/2005751_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-02-1669963261084/2005756_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-02-1669963261084/2005756_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-02-1669963261084/2005757_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-02-1669963261084/2005757_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-02-1669963261084/1958826_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-02-1669963261084/1958826_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-02-1669963261084/1958829_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-02-1669963261084/1958829_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-54-550-6414](tel:+82545506414)\n- [üè†www.gbmg.go.kr](http://www.gbmg.go.kr/tour/main.do)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.7806200693\nlongitude: 128.0515186601\ntitle: Munyeong-eup, Mungyeong-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \nTake the bus towards Mungyeong from Dong Seoul Terminal (06:30 - 20:00, departs every 40min - 1hr 30min / travel time: 2 hours)\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-02-1669963261084","title":"Joryeongsan Mountain (Ï°∞Î†πÏÇ∞)","description":"Joryeongsan Mountain divides Mungyeong (Gyeongsangbuk-do) and Goesan (Chungcheongbuk-do), and is situated at the far end of Baekdudaegan Mountain Range that connects Baekdusan and Jirisan Mountains.

She also ordered the construction of the famous nine-story wooden pagoda of Hwangyongsa Temple, a significant achievement of Buddhist architecture. While many of her efforts laid the foundation for the unification of Three Kingdoms of Korea, Queen Seondeok‚Äôs reign was plagued by rebellion and strife and she died in 647 during a rebellion, 23 years before unification was realized.","regDate":"2022-12-07","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-07-1670398594153/179719_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-07-1670398594153"},{"id":"2022-12-07-1670395284321","title":"Tomb of King Wonseong (Í≤ΩÏ£º ÏõêÏÑ±ÏôïÎ¶â)","description":"The tomb of the King Wonseong, 38th king of the Silla Kingdom (785-798) in Oedong-eup, Wolseong-gun, Gyeongju is Historic Site No. 26.
