Aside from the fact that it is circled by a protective two-layer rock, the tomb has no other unique features. As the oldest daughter of King Jinpyeong, Queen Seondeok became the first queen of the Silla Kingdom. During the 16th year of her reign, Bunhwangsa Temple and Cheomseongdae Observatory were built. She also ordered the construction of the famous nine-story wooden pagoda of Hwangyongsa Temple, a significant achievement of Buddhist architecture. While many of her efforts laid the foundation for the unification of Three Kingdoms of Korea, Queen Seondeok’s reign was plagued by rebellion and strife and she died in 647 during a rebellion, 23 years before unification was realized.","regDate":"2022-12-07","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-07-1670398594153/179719_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-07-1670398594153"},{"id":"2022-12-07-1670395284321","title":"Tomb of King Wonseong (경주 원성왕릉)","description":"The tomb of the King Wonseong, 38th king of the Silla Kingdom (785-798) in Oedong-eup, Wolseong-gun, Gyeongju is Historic Site No. 26.

Muinseok in particular is a favorite among visitors because of its exotic appearance. The statue is sometimes compared to a strong and charismatic person of Arabic or Persian descendant, much like the merchants who came to Silla in ancient times.<br><br> Gwaereung is styled after tombs of the Tang dynasty, but still retains all the characteristics typical of Silla tombs; namely, the stones around the tomb, the 12 oriental zodiac figures, the protective walls, and the decorative stonework.","regDate":"2022-12-07","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-07-1670395284321/219704_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-07-1670395284321"},{"id":"2022-12-07-1670391364282","title":"Tomb of King Munmu (경주 문무대왕릉)","description":"A little rocky islet approximately 200 meters from the shore at Bonggil-ri is the Tomb of King Munmu (AD 661-681), who unified the three kingdoms and became the 30th ruler of the Silla Kingdom. The king gave specific instructions to be buried in the East Sea after his death so that he would become a dragon and protect Silla from foreign invaders. The rocky island, about 200 meters in circumference, is divided by a cross-shaped waterway, forming a pool at the center, at the bottom of which is a granite stone 3.6 meters long, 2.9 meters wide and 0.9 meters thick. Legend has it that the remains of King Munmu’s cremated body are buried under this rock. Historians still debate whether the ashes of the King Munmu were scattered or stored in an urn and placed under the rock.","regDate":"2022-12-07","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-07-1670391364282/1613346_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-07-1670391364282"},{"id":"2022-12-07-1670388081385","title":"The POSCO Museum  (포스코 역사관)","description":"The POSCO Museum shows the history, spirit, corporate culture and vision of POSCO.
