Aside from the fact that it is circled by a protective two-layer rock, the tomb has no other unique features. As the oldest daughter of King Jinpyeong, Queen Seondeok became the first queen of the Silla Kingdom. During the 16th year of her reign, Bunhwangsa Temple and Cheomseongdae Observatory were built. She also ordered the construction of the famous nine-story wooden pagoda of Hwangyongsa Temple, a significant achievement of Buddhist architecture. While many of her efforts laid the foundation for the unification of Three Kingdoms of Korea, Queen Seondeok‚Äôs reign was plagued by rebellion and strife and she died in 647 during a rebellion, 23 years before unification was realized.","regDate":"2022-12-07","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-07-1670398594153/179719_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-07-1670398594153"},{"id":"2022-12-07-1670395284321","title":"Tomb of King Wonseong (Í≤ΩÏ£º ÏõêÏÑ±ÏôïÎ¶â)","description":"The tomb of the King Wonseong, 38th king of the Silla Kingdom (785-798) in Oedong-eup, Wolseong-gun, Gyeongju is Historic Site No. 26.

The rocky island, about 200 meters in circumference, is divided by a cross-shaped waterway, forming a pool at the center, at the bottom of which is a granite stone 3.6 meters long, 2.9 meters wide and 0.9 meters thick.
