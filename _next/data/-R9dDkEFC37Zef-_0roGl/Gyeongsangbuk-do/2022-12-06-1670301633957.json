Daeyasan Mountain (931 meters) runs across both valleys, which are 10 kilometers apart from each other. The valley is relatively untouched as it is not yet well known to the public. At the beginning and the end of the trail are Hakcheonjeong and Chirujeong Pavilions, respectively. Both sides of the valley are lined with thick forests of ancient pine trees. A number of stone carvings can be found in the forest, and the most famous one reads “Seonyugyegok.” It was written by Choi Chi-won, a leading scholar of the Silla kingdom.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-54-550-6414|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-06-1670301633957/1958800_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-06-1670301633957/1958800_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-06-1670301633957/1958801_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-06-1670301633957/1958801_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-06-1670301633957/1958802_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-06-1670301633957/1958802_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-06-1670301633957/1958803_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-06-1670301633957/1958803_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-06-1670301633957/2367663_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-06-1670301633957/2367663_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-06-1670301633957/2367665_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-06-1670301633957/2367665_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-06-1670301633957/2367666_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-06-1670301633957/2367666_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-06-1670301633957/2367667_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-06-1670301633957/2367667_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-54-550-6414](tel:+82545506414)\n- [🏠www.gbmg.go.kr](http://www.gbmg.go.kr/tour/main.do)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.6778467727\nlongitude: 127.9564217492\ntitle: Wanjang-ri, Mungyeong-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \nAt Dong Seoul Bus Terminal, take a bus for Mungyeong (2 hours) <br>\n In Mungyeong, take a bus for Beolbawi.&nbsp;(1-hour bus ride)<br>\n<br>\n At Dong Seoul Bus Terminal, take a bus for Gaeun (2 hours and 40 minutes) <br> In Gaeun-eup, take a bus for Beolbawi.

Aside from the fact that it is circled by a protective two-layer rock, the tomb has no other unique features. As the oldest daughter of King Jinpyeong, Queen Seondeok became the first queen of the Silla Kingdom. During the 16th year of her reign, Bunhwangsa Temple and Cheomseongdae Observatory were built. She also ordered the construction of the famous nine-story wooden pagoda of Hwangyongsa Temple, a significant achievement of Buddhist architecture. While many of her efforts laid the foundation for the unification of Three Kingdoms of Korea, Queen Seondeok’s reign was plagued by rebellion and strife and she died in 647 during a rebellion, 23 years before unification was realized.","regDate":"2022-12-07","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-07-1670398594153/179719_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-07-1670398594153"},{"id":"2022-12-07-1670395284321","title":"Tomb of King Wonseong (경주 원성왕릉)","description":"The tomb of the King Wonseong, 38th king of the Silla Kingdom (785-798) in Oedong-eup, Wolseong-gun, Gyeongju is Historic Site No. 26.

The rocky island, about 200 meters in circumference, is divided by a cross-shaped waterway, forming a pool at the center, at the bottom of which is a granite stone 3.6 meters long, 2.9 meters wide and 0.9 meters thick. Legend has it that the remains of King Munmu’s cremated body are buried under this rock.
