According to the Korean Language Society, the temple began to be called Eunsusa (meaning ‘Silver Water Temple’) after King Taejo (the founder of the Joseon dynasty) visited the temple and remarked that the water flowing nearby was as clean and smooth as pure silver. <br><br>\n\nThe temple is home to the largest known Beopgo (Buddhist drum used for rituals), which was produced in 1982. A stone sculpture and a statue of Granny Samsin (a goddess that looks after babies’ births and keeps them healthy) also stand at the temple. However, the temple’s most treasured assets are its two Natural Monuments: Emerald Gaiety (a climbing vine, Natural Monument No. 380) and the Cheongsil Pear Tree (Natural Monument No. 386). Reverse icicles, though found all over the mountainsides, are most readily and abundantly found in the Eunsusa Temple area.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-63-433-2502|\n|parking:|Maisan Provincial Park Parking Lot|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|[Cultural Assets (Maisan Tapgun & Geumdangsa)]<br>Individuals - Adults 3,000 won / Teenagers 2,000 won / Children 1,000 won<br />Groups - Adults 2,800 won / Teenagers 1,600 won / Children 800 won<br /<br><br>* Group: 30 or more people|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Not available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-31-1659303488502/1605747_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659303488502/1605747_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659303488502/1605748_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659303488502/1605748_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659303488502/1605749_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659303488502/1605749_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659303488502/1605750_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659303488502/1605750_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659303488502/1605751_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659303488502/1605751_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659303488502/1605753_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659303488502/1605753_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-63-433-2502](tel:+82634332502)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.7594668368\nlongitude: 127.4144950983\ntitle: 406, Maisannam-ro, Jinan-gun, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Jeonju Intercity Bus Terminal, take an intercity bus to Jinan Bus Terminal. <br>\nFrom Jinan Bus Terminal, take a bus bound for Maisan.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-31-1659303488502","title":"Eunsusa Temple (은수사)","description":"The temple located upon Maisan Mountain was called Sangwonsa Temple during the early Joseon dynasty and was later known as Jeongmyeongam Hermitage.
