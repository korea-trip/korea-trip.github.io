The flat part of the peak (the turtle‚Äôs ‚Äúhead‚Äù) is home to the Tomb of King Suro.

Since sophisticated navigation equipment had yet to be invented, it can be assumed that she found her way to the Garak Kingdom by following the stars.

The place is still referred to as Bibidan, which means a place to watch the stars. <Br><br>These historical facts indicate the stars were very important to the Gaya, an ancient kingdom established mainly in the Gimhae area.
