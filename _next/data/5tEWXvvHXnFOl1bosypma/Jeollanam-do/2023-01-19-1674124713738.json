It used to be&nbsp;part of&nbsp;Daegu-myeon until 1789 but&nbsp;later&nbsp;changed to Boam-myeon and is currently part of Doam-myeon&nbsp;since 1914 due to reorganization of administration. The name comes from its appearance in relation to Boeunsan Mountain in Ganjin-eup, which looks like&nbsp;a cow‚Äôs head. The whole island resembles a cow‚Äôs meonge (curved stick around cow‚Äôs neck&nbsp;used to&nbsp;drag farming tool) so the island became to be called Gaudo Island (Ga  Meonge in Chinese characters). <br><br> From Gaudo Island, Gangjinman Bay and uninhabited island can be seen in all directions. The coastal scenery is stunning and varied natural tourism resources grow here such as the silver magnolia, cypress colony, and Japanese black pines. Visitors can walk to the island from the mainland via a suspension bridge. When arriving to the island, a 2.5km long ecological exploring road along the mountain and coast is available. Also, fishing park which has various kinds of&nbsp;fishes is located in the spot where visitors can overlook&nbsp;at beautiful scenery of Gangjinman Bay. At the top of the island, visitors can enjoy a zip track which is an eco-friendly leisure facility, starting from Cheongja Tower (25m high).\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-61-430-3114|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Areas Open to the Public:|Jeodu Bridge: 438m / approx. 10 min walk <br />Mangho Bridge: 716m / approx. 15 min walk|\n|Hiking Course:|Hamggehae-gil (approx. 2.5km / 1hr 30 min)|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|[Infrastructure]<br>Cheongja Tower, fishing park, suspension bridge, etc.<br><br>[Convenient Facility]<br>Two restrooms, two supermarkets, etc.|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-19-1674124713738/2026870_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-19-1674124713738/2026870_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-19-1674124713738/2026874_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-19-1674124713738/2026874_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-19-1674124713738/2026875_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-19-1674124713738/2026875_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-19-1674124713738/2370971_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-19-1674124713738/2370971_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-19-1674124713738/2483138_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-19-1674124713738/2483138_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-19-1674124713738/2483140_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-19-1674124713738/2483140_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-19-1674124713738/2483161_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-19-1674124713738/2483161_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-19-1674124713738/2483163_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-19-1674124713738/2483163_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-19-1674124713738/2483118_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-19-1674124713738/2483118_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-19-1674124713738/2483158_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-19-1674124713738/2483158_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-61-430-3114](tel:+82614303114)\n- [üè†www.gaudo.co](http://www.gaudo.co)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 34.5283725869\nlongitude: 126.7726522891\ntitle: 473, Wolgot-ro, Gangjin-gun, Jeollanam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Seoul Central City Bus Terminal, take a bus to Gangjin Bus Terminal.<br>\nFrom Gangjin Bus Terminal Bus Stop, take a Nongeochon Bus bound for Maryang and get off at Jeodu Village Bus Stop.<br>\nCross the bridge to reach the island.\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-19-1674124713738","title":"Gaudo Island (Í∞ÄÏö∞ÎèÑ)","description":"Gaudo Island is the only populated island of the eight islands in Gangjinman Bay.

The reservoir was recreated and expanded into todays lotus habitat thanks to the effort of Jeong Su-dong, who planted twelve lotus roots along the shoreline and took care of them dearly after dreaming of twelve white cranes landing upon the reservoir. The white lotus flowers in this pond blossom and fall from July until September. A lotus festival is held in August, when the flowers are at their peak.","regDate":"2023-01-26","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollanam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Eco-Tourism Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-26-1674722336812/2399156_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollanam-do/2023-01-26-1674722336812"},{"id":"2023-01-26-1674718570005","title":"Muan Ecological Tidal Flat Land (Î¨¥ÏïàÌô©ÌÜ†Í∞ØÎ≤åÎûúÎìú(Íµ¨ Î¨¥ÏïàÏÉùÌÉúÍ∞ØÎ≤åÏÑºÌÑ∞))","description":"Muan Ecological Tidal Flat Land in Muan, Jeollanam-do was established in an effort to raise awareness of the ecology and importance of natural wetlands.
