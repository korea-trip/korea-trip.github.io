Another point of interest at Namaehang Port is the Namaehang Skywalk Observatory. Located at the entrance to the breakwater, this observation point offers a breathtaking view of the Namaehang Port area and the East Sea. The island, where the skywalk is located, was called Yangyado Island during the Joseon period, and the site of this observation point used to have a beacon during the Joseon period.

Along with Ganghwa‚Äôs Bomunsa Temple and Namhae‚Äôs Boriam Hermitage, it is said to be one of the three centers of the cult of Avalokitesvara in Korea. Its handsome view overlooking the East Sea has earned it a spot in the Eight Sights of Gwandong (eight famous sights in Yeongdong region of Gangwon-do), documented throughout the ages in many classic literature and poetry. Today‚Äôs Naksansa Temple is a product of many restorations and expansions, and has many examples of cultural heritage within its walls.

The waters are so pure, the small pebbles and sand lining the bottom of the stream can be seen clearly.

Starting at Mureung Rock, a wide sheet of single rock on which hundreds can sit, the valley trail twists and turns as it passes Samhwasa Temple, Haksodae, Ongnyudong, and Seonnyeotang Ravine, all the way to Ssangpokpo and Yongchupokpo Falls, providing breathtaking scenery along the way. Also known as Arcadia, scholars and poets frequented the valley in times past, and the 5,000 square meters of Mureung Rock bears the inscribed names of some of these poets and their work.
