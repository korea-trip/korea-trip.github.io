The area‚Äôs big temperature difference between day and night and the frequent thick fog provide ideal conditions for tea cultivation. The tea cultivated at Gangjin Dawon has a strong scent and rarely tastes bitter. Gangjin Dawon is the home of the nation‚Äôs first green tea product ‚ÄúBaegunokpancha.‚Äù Since 1980, an extensive area of mountainous territory has been cultivated for green tea production to become the more than 80 acres of green tea fields that it is today. As Gangjin Dawon is relatively lesser known than the green tea fields in Boseong, visitors can enjoy a relaxing time surrounded by the vastness of the green tea fields. Nearby attractions include Baengnyeonsa Temple, the Birthplace of Yeongnang, Gangjin Goryeo Cheongja kiln site, and Dasan Chodang, the house where the famous scholar Dasan Jeong Yak-yong (1762-1836) lived during his exile.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-61-432-5500|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-19-1674110421678/2648774_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-19-1674110421678/2648774_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-19-1674110421678/2648775_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-19-1674110421678/2648775_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-19-1674110421678/2648776_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-19-1674110421678/2648776_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-19-1674110421678/2648777_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-19-1674110421678/2648777_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-19-1674110421678/2648778_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-19-1674110421678/2648778_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-61-432-5500](tel:+82614325500)\n- [üè†www.gangjin.go.kr](http://www.gangjin.go.kr/culture)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 34.7409031836\nlongitude: 126.7061613195\ntitle: 93-25, Baegun-ro, Gangjin-gun, Jeollanam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>\nFrom Seoul Central City Bus Terminal, take an intercity bus to Gangjin Bus Terminal. <br>\nFrom Gangjin Bus Terminal, take Bus No. 5-4 and get off at Weollam Bus Stop.<br>\nWalk for approx. 513 m.\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-19-1674110421678","title":"Gangjin Dawon Tea Plantation (Ï†ÑÎÇ® Í∞ïÏßÑÎã§Ïõê)","description":"Gangjin Dawon Tea Plantation is located at the southern foot of Wolchulsan Mountain in Jeollanam-do.
