Nearby attractions include Busan‚Äôs famed Jagalchi Seafood Market and Amnam Park. Amnam Park was a military protected area that opened to the public as a nature park in April 1996. Amnam Park, as well as Dudo Park, a famous sea fishing spot, connects to Songdo, where visitors can see a spectacular landscape with seagulls, a symbol of busan, and the quiet seascape with Yeongdo Island in the distance. \n<br><br>\nThe area has a variety of accommodation and dining options, and is well equipped with convenient facilities such as an overpass, promenade, boat yard, and parking lot. Amnam Park on the Songdo coast is a coastal ecological park.
