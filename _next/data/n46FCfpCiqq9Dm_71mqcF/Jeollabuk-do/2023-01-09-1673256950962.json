In the third year of King Chungsuk of Goryeo (1316), the temple saw the addition of a five-story stone pagoda, built by Monk Deokhyeon. At its peak, the temple was said to have had 12 hermitages and housed 1,000 monks. It was burned down during the Imjin War (1592-1598), leaving only the pagoda, but was rebuilt a few years later by Monk Soyo during the 37th year of King Seonjo (1604). Unfortunately, the temple was burned down again in the Korean War, but was once again restored to its original state in 1959. <br><br>Cultural assets found at the temple include Stone Guardian Post of Chungsin-ri & Namgye-ri, Sunchang Guesthouse, and the Three-story Stone Pagoda of Sunhwa-ri. Nearby tourist attractions include Geumseongsanseong Fortress, Yongsopokpo Falls, Gangcheonho Lake, Damyangho Lake, Chuwolsan Mountain, Huimunsan Mountain, and Naejangsan National Park.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-63-652-5420|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|[Gangcheonsan County Park]<br>Individual: Adults 3,000 won / Students 1,000 won<br>Groups: Adults 2,500 won / Students 1,500 won<br><BR>* Groups: 30 or more people<BR>* Free admission (with ID): Senior citizens (ages 65 and older), preschoolers (ages 6 and younger) / National holidays: Children‚Äôs Day (up to elementary school students)|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-09-1673256950962/1604376_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-09-1673256950962/1604376_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-09-1673256950962/1604380_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-09-1673256950962/1604380_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-09-1673256950962/2439735_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-09-1673256950962/2439735_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-09-1673256950962/2439741_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-09-1673256950962/2439741_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-09-1673256950962/2439742_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-09-1673256950962/2439742_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-09-1673256950962/2439743_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-09-1673256950962/2439743_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-09-1673256950962/2439745_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-09-1673256950962/2439745_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-09-1673256950962/2439746_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-09-1673256950962/2439746_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-09-1673256950962/2439747_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-09-1673256950962/2439747_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-09-1673256950962/1604377_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-09-1673256950962/1604377_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-63-652-5420](tel:+82636525420)\n- [üè†gangcheonsan.kr](http://gangcheonsan.kr/?c=1/9)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.3984154482\nlongitude: 127.0555668463\ntitle: 270, Gangcheonsan-gil, Sunchang-gun, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-09-1673256950962","title":"Sunchang Gangcheonsa Temple (Í∞ïÏ≤úÏÇ¨ (ÏàúÏ∞Ω))","description":"Located approximately 1.8 kilometers from the entrance of Gangcheonsan County Park, Gangcheonsa Temple was built by Monk Doseon during the first year of Queen Jinseong of Silla (AD 887).
