The tunnel is approximately 3 meters in x_height and 10 meters in length, and divides the villages of Sindu Maeul into Dugil-ri, Seolcheon-myeon and Inam Maeul in Socheon-ri. During the Three Kingdoms Period, the rocky ridges of Seokgyeonsan Mountain drew the boundary of Sillas Mupung in the east with Baekjes Seolcheo to the west. <br>Tracing the history from the Three Kingdoms Period to the Goryeo dynasty, the cultures and traditions of the two regions were markedly different. If curious about the difference, one could simply stop by Seolcheon on market day, where the Muju and Mupung local dialects and customs can easily be distinguished. <br><br>People used to cross Seokgyeonsan Mountain by a footpath along the rocky ridge to travel between Seolcheon and Mupung. During the Japanese occupation, a new road was created by turning a cave into a tunnel through the mountain so cows and horse carts could freely pass from Muju to Gimcheon. <br><br>General Kim Yoo Shin from the Silla Kingdom, the hero of unification of the Three Kingdoms, often passed by the gate, later giving rise to the gates nickname, Tongilmun (literally Unification Gate). The gate is number one on the list of 33 scenic sites in Gucheon-dong.","regDate":"2023-01-08","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Nature","Natural Resources","Rocks"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-08-1673167020129/2366378_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-08-1673167020129"},{"id":"2023-01-08-1673163317005","title":"Omokdae and Imokdae Historic Sites (Ïò§Î™©ÎåÄÏôÄ Ïù¥Î™©ÎåÄ)","description":"Omokdae Historic Site is located on top of a steep hill and is one of the places where Yi Seong-gye, who later became King Taejo, the first king of the Joseon dynasty, stopped to celebrate his victory on his way home from a war against the Japanese army at Unbong Peak of Hwangsan Mountain. Across the bridge from Omokdae is Imokdae Historic Site, situated at the foot of Seungamsan Mountain. Approximately 80 meters downhill from Imokdae are memorial stones and a building where Mokjo, the great-great-grandfather of King Taejo, once used to live. The engraved letters on the stones are the handwritings of Emperor Gojong. Mokjo moved to Hamgyeongdo as a result of a dispute with the then minister of Jeonju, an incident which King Taejo believed to have laid the foundation for him to shape the Joseon dynasty.","regDate":"2023-01-08","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-08-1673163317005/2366405_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-08-1673163317005"},{"id":"2023-01-08-1673159877583","title":"Old Walls of Jijeon Village in Muju (Î¨¥Ï£º ÏßÄÏ†ÑÎßàÏùÑ Ïòõ Îã¥Ïû•)","description":"The Old Walls of Jijeon Village in Muju were mostly all built to mark the dividing line between houses, rather than to keep people out.
