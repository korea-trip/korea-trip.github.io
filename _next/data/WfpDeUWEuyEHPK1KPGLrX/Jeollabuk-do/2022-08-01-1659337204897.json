{"pageProps":{"content":"![Gimje Byeokgolje Reservoir (ÍπÄÏ†ú Î≤ΩÍ≥®Ï†ú)](/2022-08-01-1659337204897/1603977_image2_1.webp)\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> The Byeokgolje Reservoir in Gimje is the oldest irrigation facility in Korea. According to the Samguk Sagi (history of the three kingdoms), Byeokgolje was first built in the 21st year of the reign of King Heulhae (AD 330) of the Silla Kingdom. However, this region belonged to the Baekje kingdom at that time, so some counter that the embankment was actually built in the 27th year of King Biryou (AD 330) of the Baekje kingdom. Historians agree, however, that the reservoir was mended by King Wonseong of Silla in AD 790 and by King Hyeonjong and King Injong of the Goryeo Dynasty in AD 1143. In 1415, King Taejong of the Joseon dynasty rebuilt the whole facility, but it was washed away in heavy rains five years later in the 2nd year of King Sejong.  <br><br>\n\nOnly about three kilometers of the reservoir embankment remain intact today. Moreover, the original embankment underwent major transformations in 1925 when the Dongjin Land Improvement Association remolded it into a channel for carrying water to nearby fields. <br><br>In 1975, an archeological study of the sites where the two floodgates once stood revealed that highly refined measuring techniques had been used in the original construction of the reservoir. Thus, despite its many changes, Byeokgolje not only holds significance as Korea‚Äôs oldest manmade reservoir, but also as a historical relic that points to the highly developed engineering technology of the past.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-63-540-4094|\n|parking:|1,700 parking spaces|\n|usetime:|March-October 09:00-18:00 / November-February 09:00-17:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-01-1659337204897/1603973_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659337204897/1603973_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659337204897/1603975_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659337204897/1603975_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659337204897/1603976_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659337204897/1603976_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-63-540-4094](tel:+82635404094)\n- [üè†www.gimje.go.kr](http://www.gimje.go.kr/tour/index.gimje)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.7539160928\nlongitude: 126.8538534326\ntitle: 442, Byeokgolje-ro, Buryang-myeon, Gimje-si, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Gimje Bus Terminal, take Bus No. 11 or  13.<br>\nGet off at Pogyo Station and walk straight for approx. 285 m.\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-01-1659337204897","title":"Gimje Byeokgolje Reservoir (ÍπÄÏ†ú Î≤ΩÍ≥®Ï†ú)","description":"The Byeokgolje Reservoir in Gimje is the oldest irrigation facility in Korea.

The two sites were designated as Jeoksangsan Historical Archives during the Joseon dynasty. Hoguksa Temple was also built at that time to prevent accidents from affecting the archives. The temple, along with the existing Anguksa Temple, was used to house monk soldiers who protected the archives.<br><br> Because of the construction of Muju Power Plant, Anguksa Temple was relocated to the Hoguksa Temple site and rebuilt in 1995.
