{"pageProps":{"content":"\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> The Seated Rock-carved Buddha at Golgulam Temple consists of a Maebul (a Buddha carved in a cliff) at the very top of 12 Buddha images carved in natural rock caves located in a steep cliff of Girimsa Valley. A painting of the caving titled Golgulseokgul by Gyeomjae Jeongseon, a famous painter of the era, revealed that there was once a wooden room located in front of the Maebul, but today only a hint of the room remains on the rock. The head of the Buddha (Yukgye) is perched solid and high on the body with a clear profile of the face – sharp eyes, small lips and a long and narrow nose. In contrast to the three-dimensional face, the body is broader and flatter. The neck and upper chest sections have eroded over time. The folds in the clothing are nearly parallel, and the arm area has a v-pattern wrinkle, giving it a more realistic and three-dimensional quality. Around the head of the Buddha is a lotus-shaped halo, while the body is surrounded by a rhythmic flame-like halo. The Maebul is believed to have been created during the late Unified Silla Kingdom, as it shows similar craftsmanship to Seated Stone Vairocana Buddha (National Treasure No. 995), which was created in the year 876 and is located in Chukseosa Temple.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-54-744-1689|\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-54-744-1689](tel:+82547441689)\n- [🏠www.golgulsa.com</a> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br><a href=\"http://www.gyeongju.go.kr/tour\"target=\"_blank\" title=\"새창:  경주문화관광\">www.gyeongju.go.kr/tour</a> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br><a href=\"http://www.cha.go.kr/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"문화재청 사이트로 이동\">www.cha.go.kr](http://www.golgulsa.com/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.8030343852\nlongitude: 129.4055767822\ntitle: 101-5, Girim-ro, Gyeongju-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Seoul Express Bus Terminal, take a bus to Gyeongju Express Bus Terminal.<br>From Gyeongju Express Bus Terminal, cross the road, take Bus No. 100 or 150 at Gyeongju Express Bus Terminal Bus Stop and get off at Golgulsa Temple Bus Stop.<br>\nTake a left at  Andong Samgeori (three-way intersection) and go straight to the site.\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-13-1670924193942","title":"Seated Rock-carved Buddha at Golgulam Temple (경주 골굴암 마애여래좌상)","description":"The Seated Rock-carved Buddha at Golgulam Temple consists of a Maebul (a Buddha carved in a cliff) at the very top of 12 Buddha images carved in natural rock caves located in a steep cliff of Girimsa Valley.
