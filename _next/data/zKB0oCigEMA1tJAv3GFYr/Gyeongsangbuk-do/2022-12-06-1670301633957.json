Daeyasan Mountain (931 meters) runs across both valleys, which are 10 kilometers apart from each other. The valley is relatively untouched as it is not yet well known to the public. At the beginning and the end of the trail are Hakcheonjeong and Chirujeong Pavilions, respectively. Both sides of the valley are lined with thick forests of ancient pine trees. A number of stone carvings can be found in the forest, and the most famous one reads “Seonyugyegok.” It was written by Choi Chi-won, a leading scholar of the Silla kingdom.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-54-550-6414|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-06-1670301633957/1958800_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-06-1670301633957/1958800_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-06-1670301633957/1958801_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-06-1670301633957/1958801_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-06-1670301633957/1958802_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-06-1670301633957/1958802_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-06-1670301633957/1958803_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-06-1670301633957/1958803_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-06-1670301633957/2367663_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-06-1670301633957/2367663_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-06-1670301633957/2367665_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-06-1670301633957/2367665_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-06-1670301633957/2367666_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-06-1670301633957/2367666_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-06-1670301633957/2367667_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-06-1670301633957/2367667_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-54-550-6414](tel:+82545506414)\n- [🏠www.gbmg.go.kr](http://www.gbmg.go.kr/tour/main.do)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.6778467727\nlongitude: 127.9564217492\ntitle: Wanjang-ri, Mungyeong-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \nAt Dong Seoul Bus Terminal, take a bus for Mungyeong (2 hours) <br>\n In Mungyeong, take a bus for Beolbawi.&nbsp;(1-hour bus ride)<br>\n<br>\n At Dong Seoul Bus Terminal, take a bus for Gaeun (2 hours and 40 minutes) <br> In Gaeun-eup, take a bus for Beolbawi.
