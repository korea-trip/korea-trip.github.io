In the 19th year of his reign, King Gojong moved the capital to Ganghwa on account of its natural and strategic advantages. \nDuring the Byeongjahoran (Chinese invasion of Korea) in 1637, the palace was lost by force to the Qing dynasty of China. Later, Joseon Dynasty palace building and Ganghwa Yusubu (Ganghwa governor‚Äôs office) buildings existed in the Goryeo palace site but were destroyed by the French army during the Byeonginyangyo (French Campaign against Korea). Nowadays, the only structures that remain are the Dongheon main office (built in 1638) and Ibangcheong administration office (built in 1654). The palace and its subsidiary buildings were restored in 1977. It has historical lessons of the spirit of independence and overcoming national crisis.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-32-930-7078|\n|parking:|Available (15 parking spaces)|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|Adults: Individuals 900 won / Groups 700 won<br>Children & Teenagers: Individuals 600 won / Groups 500 won<br><br>* Groups: 20 people or more<br>* Free admission: Preschoolers (ages 6 and younger) with one companion, Senior citizens (ages 65 and over), People with disabilities plus one companion (Proof required)<br><br>* Ganghwa-gun Main Tourism Sites Discount (up to 20% discounts)<br>Main tourism site: Chojijin Fortress, Deokjinjin Fortress, Gwangseongbo Fortress, Gapgotdondae Fortification, Goryeogung Palace Site, Peace Observatory, Hwamunseok Cultural Center, Museum, Manisan Mountain, Mudflat Center, and Hamheodongcheon Stream<br><br>- 15% discount: 3-4 sites<br>- 20% discount: 5 or more sites<br> * When choosing 8 sites or more, the ticket is valid until the next day|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Korean Info.
