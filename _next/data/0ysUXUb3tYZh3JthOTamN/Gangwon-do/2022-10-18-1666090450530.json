The source water originates from the Jangcheoncheon Stream, passing through the lake, and goes to the East Sea via the waterway under the Yeongnanggyo Bridge. The lake is adjacent to the areas of Jangsa-dong, Yeongnang-dong, Dongmyeong-dong, and Geumho-dong. The pleasant trail is also established around the lakeside, surrounded by the beautiful scenery of cherry blossoms, azaleas, and reeds. According to Samguk yusa (Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms), the name of the lake comes from Silla‚Äôs hwarang (elite warrior group in Silla) member named ‚ÄúYeongnang.‚Äù After training at Geumgangsan Mountain, Yeongnang passed this lake on the way to get to the martial arts competition. As he was so taken by the splendid landscape, however, he forgot about the competition and stayed here for a long time. As the old record says, Yeongnangho Lake boasts outstanding scenery. Beombawi Rock, in particular, evokes visitors‚Äô admiration as one of the Eight Sights of Sokcho. The rock, which resembles the shape of a tiger crouching down, has an aura of mystery. The nearby tourist attractions also include Gwaneumam Rock, which is known for the strange rocks and bizarre stones, Bogwangsa Temple, and the Wetland Eco Park, which is located in the west of the lakeside.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-33-639-2690|\n|parking:|Not available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Open 24 hr|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-10-18-1666090450530/677375_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-18-1666090450530/677375_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-18-1666090450530/2494926_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-18-1666090450530/2494926_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-18-1666090450530/2494928_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-18-1666090450530/2494928_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-18-1666090450530/2711166_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-18-1666090450530/2711166_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-18-1666090450530/2711167_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-18-1666090450530/2711167_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-18-1666090450530/2711168_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-18-1666090450530/2711168_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-18-1666090450530/2711169_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-18-1666090450530/2711169_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-18-1666090450530/2494930_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-18-1666090450530/2494930_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-33-639-2690](tel:+82336392690)\n- [üè†www.sokchotour.com](http://www.sokchotour.com)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 38.2142227476\nlongitude: 128.5807503766\ntitle: 140, Yeongnanghoban-gil, Sokcho-si, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Dong Seoul Bus Terminal, take a bus to Sokcho Express Bus Terminal.<br>\nFrom Sokcho Express Bus Terminal Bus Stop, take Bus No. 7-1 or 9-1 and get off at Yeongnanggyo Bridge Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-10-18-1666090450530","title":"Yeongnangho Lake (ÏòÅÎûëÌò∏)","description":"Yeongnangho Lake is a deep and large lake with a circumference of 7.8 km, an area of about 1.2 km2, and a depth of over 8 m, formed by the development of coastal dunes.

Biryongpokpo Falls is located between Towangseong Falls in the upper region and Yukdam Falls in the lower region. Biryongpokpo Falls was named after the shape of the water stream of the falls (pokpo) resembling a dragon (ryong) ascending (bi) to heaven. Their powerful water streams pouring into the narrow and rough valley look like a legendary dragon. There is another tale associated with Biryongpokpo Falls. A dragon lived here, and one day villagers offered a maiden to the dragon to break the drought. Then, the dragon flew up to the sky, and there were no more droughts in the village. The waterfalls drop 16 m to the ground and their loud sound resonates in the valley. In winter, the waterfalls freeze and the frozen water columns offer another magnificent view. A clear pond is formed beneath the falls and around which there is a wooden observation deck. Biryongpokpo Falls and Surroundings in Seoraksan Mountain were designated as the Scenic Site No. 95. It takes about 1 hr from the Small Park to the Biryongpokpo Falls, while it takes about 3 hr (round-trip) to visit up to Towangseong Falls and Yukdam Falls.
