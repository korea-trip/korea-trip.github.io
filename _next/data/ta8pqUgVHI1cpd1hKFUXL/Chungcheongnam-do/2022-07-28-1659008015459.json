The beach has a long stretch of shimmering white sand and the ebbing tide creates a different view of the horizon. Though the water level has a large tidal range, the beach's moderate water temperature makes it suitable to swim even in late summer. The beach is 1.2 kilometers long and 300 meters wide, and is made up of fine silica sand. <br><br> Baeksajang Beach and the nearby Sambong Beach is one of the major sources of jumbo shrimp. During autumn, crowds come to enjoy the taste of fresh jumbo shrimp. The beach even holds a prawn festival every fall when jumbo shrimp production peaks.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Korea Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <BR>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-41-670-2691|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Accommodations, walking path, etc.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-28-1659008015459/2716427_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1659008015459/2716427_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1659008015459/2716428_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1659008015459/2716428_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1659008015459/2716429_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1659008015459/2716429_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-28-1659008015459/2716430_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-28-1659008015459/2716430_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-41-670-2691](tel:+82416702691)\n- [üè†taean.go.kr](http://taean.go.kr/tour.do)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.5778208923\nlongitude: 126.3137999443\ntitle: Changgi-ri, Taean-gun, Chungcheongnam-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-28-1659008015459","title":"Baeksajang Beach (Î∞±ÏÇ¨Ïû•Ìï¥ÏàòÏöïÏû•)","description":"Baeksajang Beach is located near Baeksajangpogu Port which is just 4 kilometers southwest of Anmyeon-do Yeonyukgyo Bridge, the bridge connecting the mainland to the island.
