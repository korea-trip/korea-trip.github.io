At Changnam, it changes direction and enters Bangu-ri, Buri-myeon, Geumsan-gun. From here, the river flows through steep mountains.

The Geumgang River under Jeokbyeok is as calm as a peaceful lake with long sandy shores. This riverbank is alive with beautiful flowers in spring, green pine trees in summer, and in fall, the green gives way to an autumnal tint, until lovely snowscapes blanket the area in winter.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-41-750-2371~4|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-09-1667979513690/710686_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-09-1667979513690/710686_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-09-1667979513690/710693_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-09-1667979513690/710693_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-09-1667979513690/710729_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-09-1667979513690/710729_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-09-1667979513690/710733_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-09-1667979513690/710733_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-09-1667979513690/710742_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-09-1667979513690/710742_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-09-1667979513690/710747_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-09-1667979513690/710747_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-09-1667979513690/710752_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-09-1667979513690/710752_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-09-1667979513690/710787_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-09-1667979513690/710787_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-09-1667979513690/710797_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-09-1667979513690/710797_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-09-1667979513690/710689_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-09-1667979513690/710689_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-41-750-2371](tel:+82417502371)\n- [üè†www.geumsan.go.kr](http://www.geumsan.go.kr/tour/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.0508090431\nlongitude: 127.5911688528\ntitle: 697, Jeokbyeokgang-ro, Geumsan-gun, Chungcheongnam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Seoul Express Bus Terminal, take an express bus to Geumsan Bus Terminal.<br>\nWalk approx. 173 m to San-ri Bus Stop and take a local bus bound for Sutong-ri.<br>\nGet off at Buri Sutong Village Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-09-1667979513690","title":"Jeokbyeokgang River (Ï†ÅÎ≤ΩÍ∞ï)","description":"The primary source of the Geumgang River is a spring located on Ddeunbong Peak in Subun-ri, Jangsu-gun, Jeollabuk-do, which flows to the north.
