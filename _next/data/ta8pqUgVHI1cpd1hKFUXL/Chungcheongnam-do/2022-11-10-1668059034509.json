Mongsanpos white sand beach is around 3 kilometers long and has a 5 degree tilt. The water is 1~2 meters deep with an average temperature of 22 degrees Celsius. <br><br>The beach is surrounded by a dense forest of pine trees. The pine tree forest along the beach serves as a good auto-camping location to enjoy some fresh air and the natural beauty of the surroundings. During low tide, the muddy sediments deposited by the tide provide a place where people come to catch clams and mud crabs or as a field trip for children to learn the mudflat ecosystem. <br><br>A 1-kilometer drive in the western direction while passing through the spectacular pine tree tunnel brings visitors to Mongdaepogu Port where a number of fishing boats are docked. Near the port, there are a number of small seafood eateries to enjoy freshly sliced raw fish at  reasonable prices.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-41-670-2691|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Íµ≠Î¨∏ÎπÑÌëúÏ∂ú|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-10-1668059034509/1599895_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-10-1668059034509/1599895_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-10-1668059034509/1599896_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-10-1668059034509/1599896_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-10-1668059034509/1599897_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-10-1668059034509/1599897_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-10-1668059034509/1599898_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-10-1668059034509/1599898_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-10-1668059034509/1599899_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-10-1668059034509/1599899_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-10-1668059034509/1599900_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-10-1668059034509/1599900_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-10-1668059034509/1599902_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-10-1668059034509/1599902_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-41-670-2691](tel:+82416702691)\n- [üè†www.mongsanpo.or.kr</a><br /><a href=\"http://taean.go.kr/tour.do\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"ÌÉúÏïà Î¨∏ÌôîÍ¥ÄÍ¥ë ÏÇ¨Ïù¥Ìä∏Î°ú Ïù¥Îèô\">taean.go.kr](http://www.mongsanpo.or.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.6701403637\nlongitude: 126.2875471184\ntitle: 65-27, Mongsanpo-gil, Taean-gun, Chungcheongnam-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-10-1668059034509","title":"Mongsanpo Beach (Î™ΩÏÇ∞Ìè¨Ìï¥ÏàòÏöïÏû•)","description":"Mongsanpo Beach, part of Taeanhaean National Park, stretches 18 kilometers southwest of Seosan, 9 kilometers south of Taean and along the west coast of the Nammyeon Peninsula.
