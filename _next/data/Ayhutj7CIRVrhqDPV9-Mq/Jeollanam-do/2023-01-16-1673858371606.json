The trademark image of the island is Jjangttungeo Bridge, a 470-meter-long wooden bridge built above the mud flat. The bridge allows visitors to observe mud creatures all without stepping foot in the mud. The jjangttungeo (mudskipper) is only able to live in clean mud flats and they are easily found in this island. The name of the bridge comes from the image of many mudskippers jumping around the bridge. During low tide, the vast mud flat appears, as well as various mud organisms including mudskippers, crabs, clams and lug worms. When the tide is high, crossing this bridge will give the feeling of walking on water. The sight seen from the bridge is perfect for a date course, and the bridge leads to Ujeong Beach, which offers a beautiful view of the setting sun.","regDate":"2023-01-24","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollanam-do","Culture/Art/History","Architectural Sights","Bridges"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-24-1674552966306/2612383_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollanam-do/2023-01-24-1674552966306"},{"id":"2023-01-24-1674549512720","title":"Jirisan National Park (Nogodan Peak Section) (지리산국립공원 (지리산 노고단))","description":"Jirisan National Park covers a vast amount of land in three provinces, including one city and three counties.

It is made up of 250 smaller islands, and it is famous for a strip of dry road that appears from the middle of the sea, near the end of February and mid June of the lunar calendar.  As it resembles a passage in the Old Testament in the Book of Exodus, the event is called “The Miracle of Moses.”  When the water recedes, a road about 30-40 meter wide and 2.8-kilometer long appears and stays for about an hour before being submerged again. <br><br>Jindo Island has some legends which are still popular today, especially that of “Old Woman Bbyong of Hoedongri.” A long time ago, there were many tigers on Jindo Island. When tigers began appearing frequently in the village, the people fled to Modo Island. In the process, only the old woman Bbyong ended up remaining on the island, so the lady prayed everyday to Yongwang, the god of the ocean, to let her see her family again. Around February, Yongwang appeared to her in her dream and said, “I will send a rainbow to the sea tomorrow; ride it and cross the ocean”. The next day old woman Bbyong went out to the sea and prayed again, and the seawater parted as the rainbow road appeared.  Through this road, her family and the other villagers came back to the island. Therefore when the sea parts, the people celebrate this phenomenon by holding the Yeongdeung Festival to remember the Old Woman Bbyong. During the Festival, original folk plays of Jindo Island are performed and draws many tourists into Jindo Island.","regDate":"2023-01-24","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollanam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Eco-Tourism Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-24-1674535168286/1993038_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollanam-do/2023-01-24-1674535168286"},{"id":"2023-01-24-1674531363287","title":"Jindo Island (진도)","description":"Jindo Island is the principal island among the cluster of 230 islets in the southwestern part of the Korean peninsula.
