Hongneung and Yureung look different from other royal tombs. When the name of the country changed from the Joseon dynasty to the Daehan Empire, the rulers of Korea were called emperors. Therefore, the tombs of the two emperors were modeled after the tomb of the Ming dynasty’s ruler, King Taizu (Zhu Yuanzhang). Surrounding Hongneung and Yureung are statues carved in the shape of animals such as giraffes, elephants, and lions, which can’t be seen at the other royal tombs of the Joseon dynasty.
