Hongneung and Yureung look different from other royal tombs. When the name of the country changed from the Joseon dynasty to the Daehan Empire, the rulers of Korea were called emperors. Therefore, the tombs of the two emperors were modeled after the tomb of the Ming dynasty’s ruler, King Taizu (Zhu Yuanzhang). Surrounding Hongneung and Yureung are statues carved in the shape of animals such as giraffes, elephants, and lions, which can’t be seen at the other royal tombs of the Joseon dynasty. The stonework of Hongneung tomb was made in a traditional way, while the stonework of Yureung tomb shows a more realistic and advanced technique.","regDate":"2022-08-26","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-26-1661503574183/219673_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-08-26-1661503574183"},{"id":"2022-08-26-1661499675782","title":"Heyri Art Valley (헤이리 예술마을)","description":"Heyri Art Valley is a neighborhood of inspiration, creative workshops, exhibitions, festivals, and education of all things creative arts.

The whole neighborhood is like a masterpiece due to the artworks displayed along the streets in harmony with nature’s beauty. The buildings were carefully designed as to prevent the manmade structures getting in the way from admiring the surrounding nature.
