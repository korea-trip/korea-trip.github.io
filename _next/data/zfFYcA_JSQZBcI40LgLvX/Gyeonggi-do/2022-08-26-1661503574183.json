Hongneung Tomb is the resting place of Emperor Gojong and his wife Empress Myeongseong, while Yureung Tomb is the resting place of Emperor Sunjong, his first wife Empress Sunmyeonghyo, and his second wife, Empress Sunjeonghyo. Hongneung and Yureung look different from other royal tombs. When the name of the country changed from the Joseon dynasty to the Daehan Empire, the rulers of Korea were called emperors. Therefore, the tombs of the two emperors were modeled after the tomb of the Ming dynasty‚Äôs ruler, King Taizu (Zhu Yuanzhang). Surrounding Hongneung and Yureung are statues carved in the shape of animals such as giraffes, elephants, and lions, which can‚Äôt be seen at the other royal tombs of the Joseon dynasty. The stonework of Hongneung tomb was made in a traditional way, while the stonework of Yureung tomb shows a more realistic and advanced technique.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-31-591-7043|\n|parking:|Available (88 parking spaces / Large vehicles 7, small vehicles 81) <br>09:00-19:00|\n|restdate:|Mondays|\n|usetime:|February-May & September-October: 09:00-18:00<br>June-August: 09:00-18:30<br>November-January: 09:00-17:30<br>* Last ticketing is one hour before closing.|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Bike rack|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Large vehicles 5,000 won / small & medium-sized vehicles 2,000 won|\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals: Adults 1,000 won / Children 500 won<BR>Groups: Adults 800 won / Children 400 won<BR><BR>* Adults (ages 19-64) / Children (ages 7-18)<BR>* Groups: 10 people or more<br>* Free admission: Preschoolers (age 6 & younger), senior citizens (age 65 & older), on culture day (last Wednesday of the month), visitors wearing hanbok <BR><BR>* Additional ticket package: Time package (1 year / 12:00-13:00 / 30,000 won), Lunch time package (10 times / 12:00-14:00 / 3,000 won), 1 month package (10,000 won)|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Not available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-26-1661503574183/219673_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-26-1661503574183/219673_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-26-1661503574183/219675_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-26-1661503574183/219675_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-26-1661503574183/768278_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-26-1661503574183/768278_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-26-1661503574183/768282_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-26-1661503574183/768282_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-26-1661503574183/768284_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-26-1661503574183/768284_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-26-1661503574183/768294_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-26-1661503574183/768294_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-26-1661503574183/1589375_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-26-1661503574183/1589375_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-26-1661503574183/1589379_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-26-1661503574183/1589379_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-26-1661503574183/1589380_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-26-1661503574183/1589380_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-26-1661503574183/219674_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-26-1661503574183/219674_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-31-591-7043](tel:+82315917043)\n- [üè†royaltombs.cha.go.kr](http://royaltombs.cha.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.6315564164\nlongitude: 127.2096231122\ntitle: 352-1, Hongyureung-ro, Namyangju-si, Gyeonggi-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-26-1661503574183","title":"Hongneung and Yureung Royal Tombs [UNESCO World Heritage] (ÎÇ®ÏñëÏ£º ÌôçÎ¶â(Í≥†Ï¢ÖÍ≥º Î™ÖÏÑ±Ìô©ÌõÑ)Í≥º Ïú†Î¶â(ÏàúÏ¢ÖÍ≥º ÏàúÎ™Ö,ÏàúÏ†ï Ìô©ÌõÑ) [Ïú†ÎÑ§Ïä§ÏΩî ÏÑ∏Í≥ÑÎ¨∏ÌôîÏú†ÏÇ∞])","description":"Hongneung and Yureung Royal Tombs is Historic Site No. 207.

The walls stretch across roughly 620 meters and were built during the Baekje dynasty. The fortress is built on the intersection of the Imjingang River and the Hangang River on the summit of Odusan Mountain (119 meters). The mountain‚Äôs slope is steep and stones used in the construction of the fortress walls are scattered here and there at the summit. These scattered stones are evidence that the fortress underwent repairs several times during the Samguk (Three Kingdoms) era and the Joseon dynasty, as these stones were evidently quarried and used to mend the fortress walls. Excavations have discovered a great deal of earthenware, white porcelain, tile, and iron arrowheads. Topographically, the fortress sits on a prime strategic junction and the Unification Observatory has been situated there as well. The fortress stands as an important object of study concerning fortifications and structures from the Baekje dynasty. It has been recorded on the stele of King Gwanggaeto, Samguksagi (History of the Three Kingdoms), in the Naekjebongi (Baekje Annals) and on Daedongyeojido (Map of Korea) that the fortress was the Gwanmi Fortress of Baekje, attracting many scholars and researchers interested in this period.","regDate":"2022-09-02","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Fortresses"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-02-1662104566709/188812_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-09-02-1662104566709"},{"id":"2022-09-02-1662102167895","title":"Odusan Unification Observatory (Ïò§ÎëêÏÇ∞ ÌÜµÏùºÏ†ÑÎßùÎåÄ)","description":"Located in Tanhyeon-myeon, Paju-si, Odusan Unification Observatory was established to console the feelings of dispersed families and provide an educational site for the unification education through 5F to B1 in 1992.<br>The observatory is situated in the northernmost ceasefire line of the western front where the Hangang River and Imjingang River meet.
