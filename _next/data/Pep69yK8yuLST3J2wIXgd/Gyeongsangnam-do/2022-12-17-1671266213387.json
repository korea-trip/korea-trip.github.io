The flat part of the peak (the turtle‚Äôs ‚Äúhead‚Äù) is home to the Tomb of King Suro. On the summit is a southern-style dolmen dating back to the 4th century BC that consists of 5 or 6 support stones and a large cover stone measuring 2.5m in diameter. The cover stone bears the inscription ‚ÄúGujibongseok,‚Äù said to be written by Han Ho. <br><br>Gujibong Peak is considered a sacred place by the local people because, according to legend, it is the place where the creation of the Gaya Kingdom took place.

The observatory is shaped like an egg, in memory of the legend of King Kim Suro, the founder of the Garak Kingdom, according to which the king was born from an egg. <Br><br>It is said that the queen of King Suro, Heo Hwang-ok, was a princess from the Indian country of Ayuta. Since sophisticated navigation equipment had yet to be invented, it can be assumed that she found her way to the Garak Kingdom by following the stars. It is also said that a prince of the Garak Kingdom built an observatory on the highest point of a mud fortress in Jinrye in order to make astronomical observations. The place is still referred to as Bibidan, which means a place to watch the stars. <Br><br>These historical facts indicate the stars were very important to the Gaya, an ancient kingdom established mainly in the Gimhae area. The peak of Bunseongsan Mountain, where the observatory is located, offers sweeping views of the entire area of Gimhae.
