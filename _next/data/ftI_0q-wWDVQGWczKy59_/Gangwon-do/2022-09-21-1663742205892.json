Its name reflects its dedication to the value of rest by freedom from the troubles of mundane life. The temple was built in 1997 by the monk Hongbeop as a small Buddha hall named Myojeokjeon Hall, but the discovery of a large rock shaped like a reclining Avalokiteshvara in 1999 made the temple a popular site for prayers. A large rock named Yeonhwadae, named after its shape of a lotus flower in bloom, is located below the Myojeokjeon Hall near the sea. Yeonhwadae is a great place to see the reclining Avalokiteshvara and turtle-shaped rock in the area, and many other tourists flock to see the interesting rock formations of the area, like toe rocks, foot rock, and fist rock. Lucky visitors can catch a glimpse of schools of big-scaled redfin surfacing to feed at the beach. Hyuhyuam Hermitage is also home to Myojeokjeon Hall, Darani Cave Buddha Hall, Gwaneum Buddhist Bell, and a statue of the Avalokiteshvara. The Avalokiteshvara statue, in particular, enjoys great popularity from its hilltop vantage point, having the blue seas of the East Sea to its back.","regDate":"2022-09-23","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-23-1663914439662/2711354_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-09-23-1663914439662"},{"id":"2022-09-23-1663909574042","title":"Gangneung Gyeongpo Beach (Í∞ïÎ¶â Í≤ΩÌè¨ÏàòÏöïÏû•)","description":"Located 1 kilometer away from Gyeongpodae Pavilion and 6 kilometers from downtown Gangneung, Gyeongpo Beach is a sand bank formed between Gyeongpoho Lake and the ocean.

It offers splendid scenery and many neighboring tourist attractions, such as Gugok Falls, Deungseon Falls, and Samaksan Mountain. It has excellent accessibility of public transportation, many theme park facilities, and accommodation facilities, so it has been a popular location for a young people‚Äôs membership trip from the 1970s to the 1990s. However, along with the opening of the double-track railway on the Gyeongchun Line in 2010, the Gangchon Station building was relocated and consequently, the number of visitors has decreased and the local business experienced depression. Therefore, there has been a campaign to revitalize Gangchon. Near the former Gangchon Station, the large sculpture ‚ÄúDdo-ori Gangchon‚Äù has been installed, and the reduced-size model of the Deungseongyo Bridge (suspension bridge), which was a famous tourist attraction in the past, has been reproduced. In particular, ‚ÄúDdo-ori Gangchon,‚Äù which is a popular photo zone, was built by embodying the Scaly-side Merganser (Mergus squamatus, Natural Monument No. 448), which come the area of Gangchon in winter. Additionally, the Deungseongyo Bridge, which was Korea‚Äôs first suspension bridge, but demolished in 1985, was reproduced as a tourist pedestrian bridge with a length of 58 m. Furthermore, Gangchon Land, which is a well-known theme park, and the activity of four-wheel motorcycle riding along the riverside, are also major tourist attractions in Gangchon.","regDate":"2022-09-22","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Resorts"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-22-1663840048251/1850165_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-09-22-1663840048251"},{"id":"2022-09-22-1663836728735","title":"Gachilbong Battlefield (Í∞ÄÏπ†Î¥âÏßÄÍµ¨Ï†ÑÌà¨Ï†ÑÏ†ÅÏßÄ)","description":"The entire town of Haean-myeon is contained in Haean Basin. Also known as Punch Bowl, Haean Basin is surrounded by high peaks and one of these peaks is Gachilbong. <br><br>The nature of the&nbsp;terrain in the Gachilbong area made it difficult to conduct military operations during the Korean War. The North Korean military utilized these natural features to build a solid defense position and launch counterattacks, while the South Korean soldiers in the lowland were in a disadvantageous position. South Korean soldiers were under the command of 5th Division Commander Brigadier General Min Gi-sik and 24th Regiment Commander Colonel Yu Ui-jun. On the North Korean side, the 7th, 14th, and 32nd Regiments of the 27th Division and the 23rd Regiment of the 12th Division under the  2nd Corps fought back. <br><br>By sending a&nbsp;military deployment and conducting search operations, the South Korean military completed a reconnaissance of the area on August 30 and advanced to counterattack. On August 31, after defending their position for two days, the South Korean soldiers were able to break the North Korean resistance. Each unit secured a strongly fortified position to&nbsp;draw the North Korean soldiers out. Thereafter, South Korea launched an all-out attack and captured&nbsp;Hill 1241. However, North Korea attacked again and South Korea retreated. After several attacks and counterattacks, South Korea was able to take back Gachilbong and the surrounding areas. Although it&nbsp;resulted in heavy casualties on both sides, this battle ultimately gave South Korea possession of Haean Basin.","regDate":"2022-09-22","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-22-1663836728735/2495061_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-09-22-1663836728735"},{"id":"2022-09-22-1663833255962","title":"Eulji Observatory (ÏùÑÏßÄÏ†ÑÎßùÎåÄ)","description":"Eulji Observatory, located near the Military Demarcation Line along the ridge of Gachilbong Peak, is now one of the most informative sites dating back to the Korean War.
