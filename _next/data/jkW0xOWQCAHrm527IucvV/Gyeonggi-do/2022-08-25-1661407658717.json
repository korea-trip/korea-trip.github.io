More than 97% of the land around the Gunnam flood control dam is part of North Korea. The site is effective in controlling the flooding of the Imjingang River and improving irregular water flow. This area is a key wintering site for various migratory birds such as white-naped cranes, and hooded cranes, with up to 200 birds spending every winter in the area. Given the unique characteristics created by the geographical condition of the area near the border between South and North Korea and the natural environment of the Imjingang River, the site is a great natural ecological habitat for various wildlife. \n<br><br>\nThe Gunnam Flood Control Theme Park features “The Story of Peace and Love told by Cranes” as its theme. Various story-telling facilities are installed, such as the drum of peace, a wishing tree, and crane structures. There are also outstanding facilities to minimize impact on the environment, such as an alternative habitat for cranes, fishway ecology, and ecological wetlands. The facility makes it a great place to learn about and experience ecology.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-31-839-2024|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Tour Course Information:|* Durumi-gil (Crane Road) (30 km)<br>* Taepung-gil (Typhoon Road) (23 km)<br>* Park Promenade (3 km)|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-25-1661407658717/2480736_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-25-1661407658717/2480736_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-25-1661407658717/2480737_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-25-1661407658717/2480737_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-25-1661407658717/2480738_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-25-1661407658717/2480738_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-25-1661407658717/2480739_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-25-1661407658717/2480739_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-25-1661407658717/2480740_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-25-1661407658717/2480740_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-25-1661407658717/2480742_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-25-1661407658717/2480742_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-25-1661407658717/2480743_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-25-1661407658717/2480743_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-31-839-2024](tel:+82318392024)\n- [🏠dmz.go.kr](https://dmz.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 38.1039312532\nlongitude: 127.0207183918\ntitle: Gunnam-myeon, Yeoncheon-gun, Gyeonggi-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-25-1661407658717","title":"Gunnam Flood Control Theme Park (군남홍수조절지 두루미테마파크)","description":"The Gunnam Flood Control Site is situated near the border between North and South Korea just six kilometers away from the demarcation line.

The mountain was also called bulgyeon, which means “seeing Buddha,” as it was said that a member of the royal family had a vision of the Buddha while praying at the temple. The temple used to be larger, maintaining 36 buildings on the premises and 132 hermitages spread over the mountain, but these facilities were completely destroyed during the Japanese invasions of Korea from 1592-1598 and the Korean War from 1950-1953. The temple that stands today was reconstructed in 1955. The road leading to the entrance of Surisa Temple offers gorgeous scenery with a beautiful forest and valley lining its sides; it is as if the mountain itself surrounds the temple like a painted screen.","regDate":"2022-09-08","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-08-1662626904896/1252700_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-09-08-1662626904896"},{"id":"2022-09-08-1662623445837","title":"Supullo Unsimni (수풀로 운심리)","description":"Opened in 2004, Supullo Unsimni is situated on the Namhangang Riverside. The site used to be a sandpit before it was turned into a wetland.  Effluent from wastewater treatment plants, which in the past was released directly into the Hangang River, now passes through several ponds with various aquatic plants and a one kilometer-long waterway so that it can be naturally purified.  This has contributed to an improvement in the water quality of the Hangang River. The center was built to restore the Namhangang Riverside area, which was destroyed due to sand extraction, and to restore its natural ecology of willow trees, reeds, and birds. The center organizes a number of ecological excursion programs for children.","regDate":"2022-09-08","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Eco-Tourism Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-08-1662623445837/1099393_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-09-08-1662623445837"},{"id":"2022-09-08-1662620770343","title":"Sujongsa Temple (수종사)","description":"Sujongsa Temple is a branch temple of Bongseonsa Temple, located near the top of Ungilsan Mountain.
