The mountain was also called bulgyeon, which means ‚Äúseeing Buddha,‚Äù as it was said that a member of the royal family had a vision of the Buddha while praying at the temple. The temple used to be larger, maintaining 36 buildings on the premises and 132 hermitages spread over the mountain, but these facilities were completely destroyed during the Japanese invasions of Korea from 1592-1598 and the Korean War from 1950-1953. The temple that stands today was reconstructed in 1955. The road leading to the entrance of Surisa Temple offers gorgeous scenery with a beautiful forest and valley lining its sides; it is as if the mountain itself surrounds the temple like a painted screen.","regDate":"2022-09-08","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-08-1662626904896/1252700_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-09-08-1662626904896"},{"id":"2022-09-08-1662623445837","title":"Supullo Unsimni (ÏàòÌíÄÎ°ú Ïö¥Ïã¨Î¶¨)","description":"Opened in 2004, Supullo Unsimni is situated on the Namhangang Riverside. The site used to be a sandpit before it was turned into a wetland.  Effluent from wastewater treatment plants, which in the past was released directly into the Hangang River, now passes through several ponds with various aquatic plants and a one kilometer-long waterway so that it can be naturally purified.  This has contributed to an improvement in the water quality of the Hangang River. The center was built to restore the Namhangang Riverside area, which was destroyed due to sand extraction, and to restore its natural ecology of willow trees, reeds, and birds. The center organizes a number of ecological excursion programs for children.","regDate":"2022-09-08","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Eco-Tourism Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-08-1662623445837/1099393_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-09-08-1662623445837"},{"id":"2022-09-08-1662620770343","title":"Sujongsa Temple (ÏàòÏ¢ÖÏÇ¨)","description":"Sujongsa Temple is a branch temple of Bongseonsa Temple, located near the top of Ungilsan Mountain.
