On December 9, 1984, the 82.6 ㎥ of the protective film was restored here. In addition, the unearthed models consisted of bowls and plates, as well as porcelain and pots. The colors of the glaze are greenish brown and dark green, opaque and non-glossy, and there are spots on the surface, but this is the component of the glaze. It is believed to have come from the influence of the special structure of the kiln and the firing temperature.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-32-440-4063|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-11-1660226065975/1577561_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660226065975/1577561_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660226065975/1577564_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660226065975/1577564_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660226065975/2512986_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660226065975/2512986_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660226065975/2512988_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660226065975/2512988_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660226065975/2512990_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660226065975/2512990_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660226065975/2512991_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660226065975/2512991_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660226065975/2512992_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660226065975/2512992_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660226065975/2512994_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660226065975/2512994_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660226065975/2512995_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660226065975/2512995_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660226065975/1577562_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660226065975/1577562_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-32-440-4063](tel:+82324404063)\n- [🏠www.seo.incheon.kr](http://www.seo.incheon.kr/open_content/tour/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5582466915\nlongitude: 126.6562562094\ntitle: 54, Doyoji-ro, Seo-gu, Incheon\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway]<br>\nIncheon Station (Seoul Subway Line 1), Exit 1.

The beach is also popular among tourists at sunset, when the fading sun colors the sea around the rock.<br> On the other side is a small dock and old fishing boats. This beach is less crowded than Wangsan Beach or those in Eurwang-ri, making it the perfect spot for swimming and camping. <br> There is a pretty cafe up the hill from the rock and it is a great place for enjoying the ocean scenery with a cup of tea.
