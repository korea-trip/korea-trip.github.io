At low tide, Ganworam Hermitage is connected to shore via a natural walkway, but at high tide, the walkway is submerged and the hermitage becomes an island. At night time, in particular, the hermitage and its surrounding islets create a breathtaking view as the moonlight reflects off the sea.","regDate":"2022-11-21","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-21-1669013187316/681511_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Chungcheongnam-do/2022-11-21-1669013187316"},{"id":"2022-11-21-1669006111919","title":"Seocheon Dalgogae Mosi Village (서천 달고개모시마을)","description":"In Seocheon Dalgogae Mosi Village, the long-standing tradition of Hansan mosi (ramie fabric) is passed down and preserved in the hands of the village women.
