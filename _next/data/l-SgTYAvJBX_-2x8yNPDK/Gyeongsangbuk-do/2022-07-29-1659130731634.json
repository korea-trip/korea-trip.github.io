The forest is composed of 100-year-old white pine trees brimming with pine nuts, along with pines and larches. In the forest, you can see the trees standing tall amidst the majestic rock formations. If you walk along the mountain trail, you will come to a suspension bridge, and after crossing, you will enter a section of forest that has maintained an old, almost primeval, feeling.\n<br><br>\nIn spring, beautiful wild flowers blossom throughout the forest, magnolias in particular, bloom within the valley. Cheongoksan National Recreational Forest features a variety of facilities such as a nearby water park, children‚Äôs playground, fitness center, campsite and an outdoor lecture field. The water in the water park is cold and very clean, using natural stream water. In nearby Baekcheongyegok Valley, you may also see Manchurian trout, which live in clean, fresh water streams.
