The peak is so broad that 50 adults can sit on it at the same time. Among the rocks there is Seokcheon Pond, which never dries up. The peak used to be called ‚ÄúUnjangdae‚Äù because the summit is always covered with clouds and mist. Legend says that King Sejo of Joseon dynasty supposedly recited a poem on the summit. <br> <br> Munjangdae has a great view of Cheonhwangbong Peak, the highest peak of Songnisan Mountain. Visitors can also see Gwaneumbong, Chilseongbong, Sirubong, Tugubong, Munsubong, and Birobong peaks. In autumn, visitors can enjoy views of breathtaking fall foliage along the trail, which begins at Hwabuk-myeon, Sangju.
