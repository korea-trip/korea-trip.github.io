The story of Dangun reads that he made sacrifices over 4,000 years ago, making this relic a historical treasure. \n<br>\nChamseongdan was renovated in 1270 under Goryeo Wonjong‚Äôs and after being renovated several more times. To this day it has remained the same way and kept the same appearance. Chamseongdan is a natural stone 5 meters in x_height, circular in shape at the bottom and rectangular at the top. Because it is in the middle of Baekdusan Mountain and Hallasan Mountain, you can see the islands of the West sea and the inland scenery. It is symbolically a very important place. It is said that in the past, the kings of Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla Kingdoms all offered sacrifices to the heavens here.  This form of ceremonial sacrificing continued prevailed until the Joseon Period (1392~1910). Visitors can see from scattered relics how Korea‚Äôs ancestors revered and feared the heavens.  Even now, on Gaecheonjeol Day, Koreans offer sacrifices to Dangun here, and for national athletic events, a sacred flame for the games is ignited here. \n<br>\nManisan Mountain is 495m above sea level, which makes it the highest mountain in Ganghwa. The entire area was designated as a National Tour Site in 1977.  Climb to the summit and you can see the entire Gyeonggi area. The path leading up to Chamseongdan especially has a wonderful view of the mountain and the sea, and is a favorite of the climbers.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-32-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info +82-32-930-4571|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-12-1657579267550/217642_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-12-1657579267550/217642_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-32-930-4571](tel:+82329304571)\n- [üè†www.ganghwa.go.kr</a> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br /><a href=\"http://www.cha.go.kr/\" target=\"_blank\">www.cha.go.kr](http://www.ganghwa.go.kr/open_content/tour/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.6139668020\nlongitude: 126.4315502058\ntitle: Heungwang-ri, Ganghwa-gun, Incheon\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>From Sinchon Intercity Bus Terminal, take a bus bound for Manisan Mountain.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-12-1657579267550","title":"Chamseongdan Altar (Í∞ïÌôî Ï∞∏ÏÑ±Îã®)","description":"Located on the northside of Manisan Mountain peak, Chamseongdan Altar is where Dangun (founder of Korea) is said to have offered sacrifices to the heavens.
