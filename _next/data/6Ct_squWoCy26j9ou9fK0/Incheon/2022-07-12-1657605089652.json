The street became connected samchi, or grilled seerfish, over 40 years ago with the opening House of Inha, a home-style restaurant. Originally, the street was not known for samchi, but it became one of the most popular menus at the restuarant, with many other shops in the area following in this trend. In 2002, it was designated as the grilled seerfish street and a signboard was put up at the street entrance. Currently, there are about a dozen grilled seerfish restaurants lining the street, and each restaurant has a unique signboard of its own. The fish are imported from New Zealand, and each restaurant offers a distinct taste resulting from different grilling methods and sauces. The restaurants also sell a variety of appetizers and side dishes at affordable prices.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|expagerange:|Open to visitors of all ages|\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-32-832-3031|\n|restdate:|Varies by shop|\n|usetime:|Varies by shop|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-12-1657605089652/728363_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-12-1657605089652/728363_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-12-1657605089652/728365_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-12-1657605089652/728365_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-12-1657605089652/728366_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-12-1657605089652/728366_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-32-832-3031](tel:+82328323031)\n- [üè†itour.incheon.go.kr</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.icjg.go.kr/tour/cttu0207a01\" target=\"_blank\">www.icjg.go.kr](http://itour.incheon.go.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.4757224674\nlongitude: 126.6286721359\ntitle: 57, Uhyeon-ro 67beon-gil, Jung-gu, Incheon\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway]<br>\nDongincheon Station (Seoul \nSubway Line 1), Exit 2. <br>\nTurn right, then immediately  turn left, and then go straight for about 150 m. <br>\nTurn right at the corner onto Uhyeonno 67beon-gil. <br>\n<br>\n[Bus] <br>\nDongincheon Station Bus Stop<Br>\n- Local Bus: 2, 3, 4, 6, 6-1, 10, 11, 15, 16, 17-1, 21, 21-1, 22, 23, 24, 27, 28, 41, 42, 45, 46, or 62 <br>  \n- Express bus: 105, 112, or 306\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-12-1657605089652","title":"Dongincheon Samchi Street (ÎèôÏù∏Ï≤ú ÏÇºÏπòÍ±∞Î¶¨)","description":"Dongincheon Samchi Street is located in front of Dongincheon Station in an alley to the side of Incheon Educational and Cultural Center for Students.

It used to be one of the two largest temples in Korea along with Songgwangsa Temple. However, the temple was completely destroyed during the early Joseon era, leaving only the site itself. The famous wood blocks of Palman Daejanggyeong (the Tripitaka Koreana), currently housed in Haeinsa Temple at Hapcheon, are said to have been originally stored in Seonwonsa Temple. It is believed that the carved wood blocks were taken from Seonwonsa to Heungcheonsa Temple during the Joseon era and again moved to Haeinsa Temple during the reign of Sejo. <br><br>Located on a mountain slope, the presumed location of the building site extends 250 meters from south to north and 170 meters from east to west.","regDate":"2022-08-10","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-10-1660153342135/1577247_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-08-10-1660153342135"},{"id":"2022-08-10-1660150781902","title":"Ganghwa Seoksumun Gate (Í∞ïÌôî ÏÑùÏàòÎ¨∏)","description":"Seoksumun is a floodgate on the Dongnakcheon Stream, which flows through the town of Ganghwa-eup.

The site was then taken by the foreign troops due to the inferior fighting power of the Korean military, and very nearly completely destroyed. In 1876 (13th year of King Gojong), the Japanese warship Unyangho invaded and forced the Joseon Kingdom to open their ports, which later led to the forced signing of the Jana-Korea Treaty of 1876. Only the base of the fortress and the site of the high ground remained until 1973, when restoration work was started. The patriotic spirit of the Joseon dynasty still remains in this historic site.","regDate":"2022-08-10","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-10-1660131384858/1577834_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-08-10-1660131384858"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
