Sitting on the edge of a cliff overlooking Osipcheon Stream, the pavilion incorporates the rocks on the cliff as cornerstones, with a five-girder paljak (ancient-style roof).<br><br>Then, there are 26 signboards hanging from the rafters of the pavilion. The signboards contain inscriptions of&nbsp;famous ancient scholars such as Jeilgyeongjeong (The best riverside pavilion; 1662) by Heo Mok, Jukseoru and Gwandong Jeilru (The best pavilion in Gwandong; 1711) by Yi Seong-jo, and Haeseon Yuhui Jiso (The place that marine gods enjoy; 1837) by Yi Gyu-heon. Others who have left their mark include King Sukjong (1674-1720), King Jeongjo (1776-1800) and Yulgok YiYi (1536-1584). Evidently, Jukseoru Pavilion has served as an inspiration since its establishment, and continues to inspire visitors today through the stunning view of its surrounding nature.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-33-570-3670|\n|parking:|Available|\n|usetime:|March-October: 09:00-18:00<br>November-February: 09:00-17:00 <br>* Last admission: 30min before closing.|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Film Locations:|Movie \"April Snow (2005)\"|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Available Facilities:|Walking trail, stone posts, etc.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Unavailable|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-10-03-1664790781429/1425802_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-03-1664790781429/1425802_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-03-1664790781429/1425804_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-03-1664790781429/1425804_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-03-1664790781429/1425823_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-03-1664790781429/1425823_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-03-1664790781429/1425825_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-03-1664790781429/1425825_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-03-1664790781429/2032652_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-03-1664790781429/2032652_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-03-1664790781429/2494692_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-03-1664790781429/2494692_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-03-1664790781429/2654472_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-03-1664790781429/2654472_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-03-1664790781429/2654474_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-03-1664790781429/2654474_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-03-1664790781429/2654475_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-03-1664790781429/2654475_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-03-1664790781429/1425785_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-03-1664790781429/1425785_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-33-570-3670](tel:+82335703670)\n- [üè†www.samcheok.go.kr</a> (Korean, English, Chinese, Japanese) <br><a href=\"http://www.cha.go.kr/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"web\">www.cha.go.kr]( http://www.samcheok.go.kr/tour.web)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.4408708123\nlongitude: 129.1604665182\ntitle: 37, Jukseoru-gil, Samcheok-si, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Seoul Express Terminal, take a bus to Samcheok Bus Terminal. <br>\nFrom Samcheok Bus Terminal, walk for approx. 10-15 min. to Jukseoru Pavilion.\n","data":{"id":"2022-10-03-1664790781429","title":"Jukseoru Pavilion (ÏÇºÏ≤ô Ï£ΩÏÑúÎ£®)","description":"Jukseoru Pavilion, estimated to have been built around 1266, is one of the eight major attractions of Gwandong District in middle eastern Korea collectively known as Gwandong Palgyeong (eight famous sites).
