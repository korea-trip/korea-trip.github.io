Located on the eastern outskirts of downtown Chuncheon, Gubongsan Mountain (441 m) with nine peaks, commands a panoramic view of the city. When the road passing halfway up the mountain was opened in the 1990s, many cafes and restaurants were established and became Chuncheon’s representative cafe street. All the cafes here have glass windows or outdoor terraces in order to offer the best scenic view for customers. Each cafe has its own characteristic feature  a building that recalls Santorini in Greece, the skywalk observatory decorated with transparent glass in all directions, and distinctive photo zones. The service area, which sells canned coffee and banquet noodles, is also situated among stylish coffee shops. Visitors will enjoy its fantastic scenic views from day to night, including the sunny scenery, the beautiful sunset, and the nighttime view of the Soyang i(2)gyo Bridge.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-33-250-4312|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|Open year round|\n|usetime:|00:00–24:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Observatory service area, cafe, and restaurant|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Free of charge|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-09-25-1664085357499/1804421_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664085357499/1804421_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664085357499/1804423_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664085357499/1804423_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664085357499/1804426_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664085357499/1804426_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664085357499/1804494_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664085357499/1804494_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664085357499/1988569_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664085357499/1988569_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664085357499/1988571_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664085357499/1988571_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664085357499/1988572_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664085357499/1988572_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664085357499/2622268_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664085357499/2622268_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664085357499/2622269_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664085357499/2622269_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664085357499/1804483_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664085357499/1804483_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-33-250-4312](tel:+82332504312)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.8928170392\nlongitude: 127.7766999636\ntitle: 1154-113, Sunhwan-daero, Dong-myeon, Chuncheon-si, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway + Taxi]<br>\nNamchuncheon Station (Seoul Subway Gyeongchun Line).<br>\nFrom the station, take a taxi for approx. 20 min.\n","data":{"id":"2022-09-25-1664085357499","title":"Gubongsan Observatory Cafe Street (구봉산 전망대 카페거리)","description":"Gubongsan Observatory Cafe Street is a well-known scenic spot for its beautiful landscape of Chuncheon with the background of mountains, lake, and river.
