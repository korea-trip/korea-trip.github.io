The building no longer exists, but the abalone-shaped stone water canal still remains, speculated to have been built during the Unified Silla period although the exact year is unknown. The water canal has an estimated length of 10 meters, with a x_width of approximately 35 centimeters and an average depth of 26 centimeters. Based on Chinese writings from 353, it is said that drinking glasses were floated on the canal. One popular party game had guests creating poems before the glass had passed nine sections of the canel. Guests who could not do this had to drink three glasses. Modern research has shown that the site was not merely a place for fun, but also served as a meeting venue for the royal family, as well as for holding memorial services.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢  For more info +82-54-745-8484|\n|parking:|Available (Small cars: 34 spaces / Large cars: 19 spaces)|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|March-October 09:00-18:00<br>November-February 09:00-17:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 2,000 won / Teenagers 1,000 won / Children 500 won<br>Groups - Adults 1,600 won / Teenagers 800 won / Children 400 won|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Small cars 2,000 won / Large cars 4,000 won|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-29-1669697007054/179844_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-29-1669697007054/179844_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-29-1669697007054/179845_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-29-1669697007054/179845_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-29-1669697007054/1200417_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-29-1669697007054/1200417_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-29-1669697007054/1200422_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-29-1669697007054/1200422_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-29-1669697007054/1200425_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-29-1669697007054/1200425_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-29-1669697007054/1200432_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-29-1669697007054/1200432_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-29-1669697007054/1200434_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-29-1669697007054/1200434_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-54-745-8484](tel:+82547458484)\n- [üè†www.gyeongju.go.kr/tour](http://www.gyeongju.go.kr/tour)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.8073108096\nlongitude: 129.2128629747\ntitle: 816, Namsansunhwan-ro, Gyeongju-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus] <br>\nFrom Dong Seoul Bus Terminal, take an intercity bus to Gyeongju Intercity Bus Terminal.\n<br>\nFrom Gyeongju Intercity Bus Terminal, take Bus No. 500 and get off at Poseokjeong Entrance Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-29-1669697007054","title":"Gyeongju Poseokjeong Pavilion Site (Í≤ΩÏ£º Ìè¨ÏÑùÏ†ïÏßÄ)","description":"Poseokjeong Pavilion served as a separate palace where kings enjoyed banquets with nobles.

When Kim Jeongho made the Daedongyeojido Map, he visited this place seven times to confirm this area is in fact the easternmost part of Korea. Following the resources of Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute, the sunrise time of Homigot on January 1 is at 7 32 am, making it the earliest first sunrise of each year in Korea. The plaza was built to commemorate these research findings with the national Sunrise Festival. Nearby attractions include Koreas largest lighthouse, Homigot Lighthouse, established in 1908; Lighthouse Museum; Monument to Commemorate Lee Yuk-sa‚Äôs Patriotism; and Daebo Seawater Bath, using pure seawater of the East Sea. <br><br>When completed, Homigot Tourism Complex and Homigot Specialized Ocean Leisure Complex will be the largest tourism complex in the eastern coast district. It will include an ocean aquarium, Ocean Ecological Park, Youth Training facilities, beach dome, accommodation facilities, and other various stores as well. <br><br> Sangsaeng‚Äôs Hand, a two-part bronze sculpture shaped like a pair of hands, was constructed in December 1999. It is a signature symbol of the sunrise festival. The left hand is on the land and the right hand is in the ocean. It was built to give the message that all people are living together by helping one another like Sangsaeng, meaning coexistence in Korean. The base of the platform is an image of the sun and its two round rings refer to harmony. These two hands have memorial sprits of reconciliation and coexistence for celebrating a new millennium.","regDate":"2022-12-01","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-01-1669884185831/2527505_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-01-1669884185831"},{"id":"2022-12-01-1669880159629","title":"Homigot Lighthouse (Ìò∏ÎØ∏Í≥∂ Îì±ÎåÄ)","description":"Homigot Lighthouse is located at Homigot Cape, listed as one of the 10 most scenic sites during the Joseon dynasty.
