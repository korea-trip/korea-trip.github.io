The name comes from the basins resemblance to a large punch bowl. The village has around 1,700 residents, and is the only town that is located inside the Civilian Access Control Line. Along with the nearby Daeamsan Mountain, Punch Bowl was once a ferocious battlefield during the Korean War. Several monuments were erected in memory of the deceased souls.
