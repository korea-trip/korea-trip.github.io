It is so renowned that it has been designated as one of the Great Mineral Springs of Korea. The water has a high content of carbon that makes it sparkle, and it tastes like Korean 7-up when sugar is added. In addition to carbon, the water also contains iron, manganese, and fluorine, making it effective in curing gastric problems and helping with digestion.<br><br>\nAccording to legend, there lived a <i>simmani</i> (ginseng digger) 300 years ago who, one day, dug a 60-year old wild ginseng in Bangdong-ri. Called <i>yukgumandal</i>, the ginseng was known to have been a great medicine of mystery. From the spot where the ginseng was dug came a mineral spring, which became today‚Äôs Bangdong Mineral Spring. The mineral spring has continued to attract people since the first day the ginseng was found and people who have drunk its water are said to have experienced various beneficial effects.\n<br>\nBangdong Mineral Spring is also close to the woods, several valleys, and waterfalls.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-33-460-2170|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Restaurants, accommodations, etc.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-24-1658648056595/1694067_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658648056595/1694067_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658648056595/1694071_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658648056595/1694071_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658648056595/1694080_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658648056595/1694080_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658648056595/2005585_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658648056595/2005585_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658648056595/2616611_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658648056595/2616611_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-33-460-2170](tel:+82334602170)\n- [üè†tour.inje.go.kr](http://tour.inje.go.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.9438728399\nlongitude: 128.3962310388\ntitle: 89-59, Bangdongyaksu-ro, Inje-gun, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-24-1658648056595","title":"Bangdong Mineral Spring (Î∞©ÎèôÏïΩÏàò)","description":"Bangdong Mineral Spring is located in Bangdong-ri in Girin-myeon.
