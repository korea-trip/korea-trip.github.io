Although the exact date of construction is uncertain, it is estimated that the building was built around the same time as Daejeonghyeon in 1416.<br>\n <br> The school was originally located inside Bukseong but it was once moved outside of Dongmun and then again to the site of Seoseong. It was finally moved to Dansan Oreum where it remains to this day. At present, Daejeonghyanggyo Confucian School  consists of Daeseongjeon, Myeongryundang, Dongjae, Seojae Shinsammun, Daeseongmun, Dongmalmun and Dongjeongmun. Daeseongjeon was remodeled in 1669, 1688, and 1752. Myeongryundang was rebuilt in 1772. After several instances of remodeling and rebuilding, Daeseongjeon was remodeled again in 1993. The Confucian school was designated as the Jeju Tangible Cultural Asset No. 4 in August 1971.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-64-742-8866|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-19-1658236093306/1617302_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658236093306/1617302_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658236093306/1617303_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658236093306/1617303_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658236093306/1617305_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658236093306/1617305_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658236093306/1617306_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658236093306/1617306_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658236093306/1617307_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658236093306/1617307_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658236093306/1617308_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658236093306/1617308_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658236093306/1617309_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658236093306/1617309_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-64-742-8866](tel:+82647428866)\n- [üè†www.visitjeju.net</a> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese, Malay) <br / ><br><a href=\"http://www.cha.go.kr/\" target=\"_blank\">www.cha.go.kr](http://www.visitjeju.net/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.2392193306\nlongitude: 126.2884466303\ntitle: 165-17, Hyanggyo-ro, Andeok-myeon, Seogwipo-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \nFrom Jeju International Airport Bus Stop, take Bus No. 152 to Sagye-ri Office Bus Stop and walk for approx. 1.6km.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-19-1658236093306","title":"Daejeonghyanggyo Confucian School (ÎåÄÏ†ïÌñ•Íµê)","description":"Daejeonghyanggyo was a Confucian school during Joseon Dynasty.

The cone is comprised of a mix of volanic rock and soil, and in comparison with other oreum, was formed rather recently. Volcanic cones are formed when magma from the main volcano seeps out of weaker points in the surrounding area, and can be considered small volcanos. Yongnunioreum is covered in a lush carpet of grass, and is home to many wildflowers.

In particular, a range of carbonate formations such as straw soda, stalactite, columns, flowstones, cave corals, and aragonite crystals can be found inside this large cave that also contains a lake.

The cave measures approximately 400 meters in length, 6 meters in x_width, and 3 meters in x_height. It is thought to have been created by lava that erupted from Hallasan Mountain some 25 million years ago. <br><br>One of the unique features of this particular cave is that it has features of both a lava tube and a limestone cave. The entire area surrounding the cave is a huge stratum of seashells and sand, while the interior is a mystical mix of stalactites and stalagmites. Lime covers the cave walls in a series of natural swirls and streaks, bringing to mind the strokes of an abstract painting. Since the cave stays at a constant 17-18‚ÑÉ throughout the year, it‚Äôs a welcome escape from the heat in the summer and a great place to warm up in the winter. <br><br>The cave gets its name from its two branches, which are said to look like the paths of two dragons (‚ÄòSsangyong‚Äô meaning ‚Äòtwo dragons‚Äô in Korean). It is thought that Ssangyonggul Cave and Hyeopjaegul Cave were once one cave since the second entrance of Ssangyonggul Cave is so close to the end of Hyeopjaegul Cave.","regDate":"2023-02-18","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-18-1676712970362/218751_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-18-1676712970362"},{"id":"2023-02-18-1676709536401","title":"Snoopy Garden (Ïä§ÎàÑÌîºÍ∞ÄÎì†)","description":"Snoopy Garden House is where visitors can meet Snoopy and friends from the popular American comic series Peanuts.

The three princesses brought with them a calf, pony, and five different seeds that eventually helped to establish agriculture in Jeju.<br><br> Curiously, the three holes are not percolated by rain or snow.
