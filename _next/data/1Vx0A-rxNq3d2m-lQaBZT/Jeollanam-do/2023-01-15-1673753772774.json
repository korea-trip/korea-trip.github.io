He was a scholar of the late Joseon dynasty and is noted for his great contributions to the development of practical learning in Korea. After he was expelled to Ganjin for writing a secret letter of appeal for religious freedom, which later was named ‘the Hwang Sa-yeong Baekseo’, he lived in the house for 18 years while studying practical learning (‘Silhak’ in Korean). Most of his famous books were written in Dasan Chodang. While walking along a road near Dasan Chodang, you can see the Cheonilgak pavilion, which offers a great view of beautiful Gangjin Bay.

Metasequoia trees were planted along the street in the early 1970s by the Ministry of Internal Affairs after National Road 24 was rebuilt. At that time, the saplings were only 3 to 4 years old and their branches stretched sparsely out into the sky; now, the trees have grown so high that they seem to block out the sun. Thanks to these stately trees, in 2002 the Korea Forest Service selected the boulevard as one of the most beautiful roads in Korea. The 8.5-kilometer-long boulevard is one of the most popular driving routes in Korea, especially during summer when the trees&rsquo; lush green leaves are at their x_height of beauty.","regDate":"2023-01-16","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollanam-do","Culture/Art/History","Experience Programs","Cultural Districts"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-16-1673865516648/2650840_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollanam-do/2023-01-16-1673865516648"},{"id":"2023-01-16-1673861765838","title":"Damyang Changpyeong Samjinae Village [Slow City] (담양 창평 삼지내마을[슬로시티])","description":"Damyang Changpyeong Samjinae Village was the first Korean place designated as a slow city in 2007.
