In addition to the gorgeous scenery, a major draw is the great seafood like fresh mullets, long-legged octopuses, small shrimps, and other local specialties said to provide strength during the sweltering summer heat. Since the beach has not yet been discovered by many tourists, visitors will be able to have a calm and relaxing time. The nearby coastal road is a perfect driving course with a stunning view of the sunset.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|expagerange:|Open to visitors of all ages|\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-61-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-61-320-1784|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Shower booth, swimming pool, hut, main stage, benches, drinking fountain|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-01-1659368778986/1608116_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659368778986/1608116_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659368778986/1608117_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659368778986/1608117_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659368778986/1608118_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659368778986/1608118_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659368778986/1608119_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659368778986/1608119_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659368778986/1608120_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659368778986/1608120_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659368778986/190579_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659368778986/190579_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-61-320-1784](tel:+82613201784)\n- [🏠www.hampyeong.go.kr](http://www.hampyeong.go.kr/tour/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.1404695621\nlongitude: 126.3901517263\ntitle: 2108, Wolcheon-ri, Hampyeong-gun, Jeollanam-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-01-1659368778986","title":"Anak Beach (안악해수욕장)","description":"Anak Beach is a white sand beach that stretches for more than 200 meters and is bordered by a forest of pine trees.

After he was expelled to Ganjin for writing a secret letter of appeal for religious freedom, which later was named ‘the Hwang Sa-yeong Baekseo’, he lived in the house for 18 years while studying practical learning (‘Silhak’ in Korean). Most of his famous books were written in Dasan Chodang. While walking along a road near Dasan Chodang, you can see the Cheonilgak pavilion, which offers a great view of beautiful Gangjin Bay.

Metasequoia trees were planted along the street in the early 1970s by the Ministry of Internal Affairs after National Road 24 was rebuilt. At that time, the saplings were only 3 to 4 years old and their branches stretched sparsely out into the sky; now, the trees have grown so high that they seem to block out the sun. Thanks to these stately trees, in 2002 the Korea Forest Service selected the boulevard as one of the most beautiful roads in Korea.
