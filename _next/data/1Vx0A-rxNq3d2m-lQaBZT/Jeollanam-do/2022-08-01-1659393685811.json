The recreational park is located on the mid-slope of Bangjangsan Mountain. Many species of wild flowers and broad-leaved trees are distributed all over Bangjangsan Recreational Forest where an exciting paragliding contest takes place annually. This is a great place to unpack and take a break for one or two days as it has accommodation facilities, promenades and trekking courses as well as a small area for splashing in the water. It takes approximately three hours to the mountain's summit from the recreational forest. In addition, there is a trekking path that leads to the Seokjeong Hot Springs on the way down the mountain.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|accomcount:|500 people for a day|\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-61-394-5523|\n|parking:|Available|\n|usetime:|Accommodations: 15:00 - 12:00 (next day)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 1,000 won / Teenagers 600 won / Children 300 won<br>Groups - Adults 800 won / Teenagers 500 won / Children 200 won<br><br>* Groups - 20 people or more<br>* Adults (ages 19-64) / Teenagers (ages 13-18) / Children (ages 7-12)<br>* Free admission December-March|\n|Facility Utilization Fees:|Accommodations: Low Season & Weekdays / Peak Season & Weekends<br><br>[Forest Cabin] <br>- Rooms (36„é°, 5 people) 46,000 won / 85,000 won<br>- Rooms (46„é°, 8 people) 77,000 won / 134,000 won<br>- Rooms (66„é°, 11 people) 91,000 won / 151,000 won<br><br>[Forest Culture Recreation Center] <br>- Rooms (23„é°~26„é°, 4 people) 39,000 won / 68,000 won<br>- Rooms (29„é°~36„é°, 5-6 people) 50,000 won / 91,000 won<br>- Rooms (49„é°~56„é°, 8-9 people) 85,000 won / 144,000 won|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Compact cars: 1,500 won <br>Small cars: 3,000 won <br>Large vehicles: 5,000 won |\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-01-1659393685811/2040885_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659393685811/2040885_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659393685811/2040890_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659393685811/2040890_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659393685811/2040894_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659393685811/2040894_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659393685811/2040895_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659393685811/2040895_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659393685811/2040898_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659393685811/2040898_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-61-394-5523](tel:+82613945523)\n- [üè†www.huyang.go.kr](http://www.huyang.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.4451632173\nlongitude: 126.7458042490\ntitle: 353, Bangjang-ro, Jangseong-gun, Jeollanam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Train] <br>\nTake a train to Baegyangsa Station from Yongsan Station (Seoul).<br>\nTake a taxi to Bangjangsan Recreational Forest from Baegyangsa Station.\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-01-1659393685811","title":"Bangjangsan National Recreational Forest (Íµ≠Î¶Ω Î∞©Ïû•ÏÇ∞ÏûêÏó∞Ìú¥ÏñëÎ¶º)","description":"Situated between Jeollanam-do and Jeollabuk-do, Bangjangsan National Recreational Forest is the highest rising peak along the ridge starting from the west of Naejangsan Mountain.

Metasequoia trees were planted along the street in the early 1970s by the Ministry of Internal Affairs after National Road 24 was rebuilt. At that time, the saplings were only 3 to 4 years old and their branches stretched sparsely out into the sky; now, the trees have grown so high that they seem to block out the sun. Thanks to these stately trees, in 2002 the Korea Forest Service selected the boulevard as one of the most beautiful roads in Korea. The 8.5-kilometer-long boulevard is one of the most popular driving routes in Korea, especially during summer when the trees&rsquo; lush green leaves are at their x_height of beauty.","regDate":"2023-01-16","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollanam-do","Culture/Art/History","Experience Programs","Cultural Districts"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-16-1673865516648/2650840_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollanam-do/2023-01-16-1673865516648"},{"id":"2023-01-16-1673861765838","title":"Damyang Changpyeong Samjinae Village [Slow City] (Îã¥Ïñë Ï∞ΩÌèâ ÏÇºÏßÄÎÇ¥ÎßàÏùÑ[Ïä¨Î°úÏãúÌã∞])","description":"Damyang Changpyeong Samjinae Village was the first Korean place designated as a slow city in 2007.
