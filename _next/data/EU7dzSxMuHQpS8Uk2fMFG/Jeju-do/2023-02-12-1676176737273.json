{"pageProps":{"content":"![Seogwipo Recreational Forest (서귀포자연휴양림)](/2023-02-12-1676176737273/1207811_image2_1.webp)\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> Seogwipo Recreational Forest is Korea’s southernmost recreational park that serves as an excellent nature getaway by preserving the mountain’s forest environment and ecosystem while minimalizing manmade structures as much as possible. The park is located approximately 700 meters above sea level, and is 10 °C lower in average temperature compared to that of Seogwipo’s downtown, providing the ideal condition to enjoy forest bathing and camping from spring to fall. The park is easily accessible by car, thanks to the paved road from the mountain’s foothills all the way up to the park’s entrance. It takes about 30 minutes by car from Seogwipo’s downtown to the recreational park. The park is densely packed with trees and the air is filled with the refreshing forest scent, and even has a pebble walking trail suitable for a barefoot massage. The forest is equipped with amenities such as a mountain cottage, forest bathing site, campfire site, cooking area, and auto-camping site. Although the amenities serve to provide visitors’ convenience, they are minimized so as to prevent damage to the forest’s natural environment.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-64-738-4544|\n|opendate:|March 21, 1995|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|[Park hours] 09:00-18:00 (Last admission 17:00)<br>[Accommodations] Check-in 15:00 / Check-out 12:00<br>[Campsite] Check-in 13:00 / Check-out 12:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Parking Fees:|Compact cars 1,000 won / Small & mid-sized cars 2,000 won / Large-sized cars and vans 3,000 won|\n|Facility Utilization Fees:|[House in the Forest ]<br> Off-season and weekdays 46,000~104,000 won / Peak season and weekends 85,000~184,000 won<br><br> [Forest Recreational Center]<br> Off-season and weekdays 34,000~63,000 won / Peak season and weekends 60,000~107,000 won<br> * Admission and parking fees are exempted.<br> <br> [Group lodging]<br> Off-season and weekdays 200,000 won / Peak season and weekends 250,000 won<br> *   Additional fees may apply.

In particular, a range of carbonate formations such as straw soda, stalactite, columns, flowstones, cave corals, and aragonite crystals can be found inside this large cave that also contains a lake. This unique cave is astounding in terms of its geological value and beauty. There are also items that can be found throughout the cave that appear to have been brought in by people who lived on the island long ago, such as pieces of pottery, animal bones, ironware, charcoal and other substances.<br><br>* The UNESCO World Heritage inscribed Geomunoreum Lava Tube System consists of Bengdwigul, Manjanggul, Gimnyeonggul, Yongcheondonggul and Dangcheomuldonggul Caves.","regDate":"2023-02-18","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-18-1676716610183"},{"id":"2023-02-18-1676712970362","title":"Ssangyonggul Cave (Hallim Park) (쌍용굴 (한림공원))","description":"Ssangyonggul Cave, a designated Natural Monument, is one of the representative lava tubes of Jeju Island along with Hwanggeumgul, Socheongul, and Manjanggul caves. The cave measures approximately 400 meters in length, 6 meters in x_width, and 3 meters in x_height. It is thought to have been created by lava that erupted from Hallasan Mountain some 25 million years ago. <br><br>One of the unique features of this particular cave is that it has features of both a lava tube and a limestone cave. The entire area surrounding the cave is a huge stratum of seashells and sand, while the interior is a mystical mix of stalactites and stalagmites. Lime covers the cave walls in a series of natural swirls and streaks, bringing to mind the strokes of an abstract painting. Since the cave stays at a constant 17-18℃ throughout the year, it’s a welcome escape from the heat in the summer and a great place to warm up in the winter. <br><br>The cave gets its name from its two branches, which are said to look like the paths of two dragons (‘Ssangyong’ meaning ‘two dragons’ in Korean). It is thought that Ssangyonggul Cave and Hyeopjaegul Cave were once one cave since the second entrance of Ssangyonggul Cave is so close to the end of Hyeopjaegul Cave.","regDate":"2023-02-18","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-18-1676712970362/218751_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-18-1676712970362"},{"id":"2023-02-18-1676709536401","title":"Snoopy Garden (스누피가든)","description":"Snoopy Garden House is where visitors can meet Snoopy and friends from the popular American comic series Peanuts.

The three princesses brought with them a calf, pony, and five different seeds that eventually helped to establish agriculture in Jeju.<br><br> Curiously, the three holes are not percolated by rain or snow.
