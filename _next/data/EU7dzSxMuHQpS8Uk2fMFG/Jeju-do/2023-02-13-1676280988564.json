{"pageProps":{"content":"![Spirited Garden (생각하는 정원)](/2023-02-13-1676280988564/608548_image2_1.webp)\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> Spirited Garden is home to hundreds of bonsai plants in a natural garden with the theme of oreum (volcanic cone) and water. The name changed from Bunjae Arpia in 2007 to commemorate the 15th anniversary after opening and to renew the garden as an international garden. The history of the garden started in 1963 when Seong Beom-yeong, the founder of the garden, came to Jeju and cultivated the wasteland full of rocks. The garden came into the international spotlight as the beautiful space was created from the wastelands by a single farmer. The garden has been visited by many honored public figures such as Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao from China, Nakasone from Japan, Kim Yongsun from North Korea and others. Currently, about 400 planted trees are on display. Also, visitors can see various facilities including stone walls and stone towers stacked with Jeju volcanic stones, the largest artificial waterfall in Jeju, and a pond filled with large carp at the base of the the waterfall.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-64-772-3701~3|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|[November-March] 08:30-18:00 <br>[April-October] 08:30-18:30<br>* Last ticketing 1 hr before closing|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Various gardens, historical photo exhibition, celebrity photo exhibition, museum shop, cafe, observation deck, pavilion, seminar room, cafeteria|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 12,000 won / Teenagers & senior citizens 10,000 won / Children 7,000 won <br>Groups - Adults 10,000 won / Teenagers & senior citizens 8,000 won / Children 5,000 won<br><br>* Adults (ages 19-64) / Teenagers (middle & high school students) / Children (ages 3-elementary students) / Senior citizens (ages 65 & over)<br>* Groups - 20 people or more|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-02-13-1676280988564/608547_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-13-1676280988564/608547_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-13-1676280988564/1206506_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-13-1676280988564/1206506_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-13-1676280988564/1206507_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-13-1676280988564/1206507_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-13-1676280988564/1206511_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-13-1676280988564/1206511_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-13-1676280988564/1206513_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-13-1676280988564/1206513_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-13-1676280988564/1206519_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-13-1676280988564/1206519_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-13-1676280988564/1206523_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-13-1676280988564/1206523_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-13-1676280988564/1206525_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-13-1676280988564/1206525_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-13-1676280988564/1206529_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-13-1676280988564/1206529_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-13-1676280988564/608545_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-13-1676280988564/608545_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-64-772-3701](tel:+82647723701)\n- [🏠www.spiritedgarden.com](http://www.spiritedgarden.com/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.3254009536\nlongitude: 126.2551753838\ntitle: 675, Nokchabunjae-ro, Jeju-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Taxi]<BR>\nApprox. 40 min from Jeju International Airport.\n","data":{"id":"2023-02-13-1676280988564","title":"Spirited Garden (생각하는 정원)","description":"Spirited Garden is home to hundreds of bonsai plants in a natural garden with the theme of oreum (volcanic cone) and water.

The cave measures approximately 400 meters in length, 6 meters in x_width, and 3 meters in x_height. It is thought to have been created by lava that erupted from Hallasan Mountain some 25 million years ago. <br><br>One of the unique features of this particular cave is that it has features of both a lava tube and a limestone cave. The entire area surrounding the cave is a huge stratum of seashells and sand, while the interior is a mystical mix of stalactites and stalagmites. Lime covers the cave walls in a series of natural swirls and streaks, bringing to mind the strokes of an abstract painting. Since the cave stays at a constant 17-18℃ throughout the year, it’s a welcome escape from the heat in the summer and a great place to warm up in the winter. <br><br>The cave gets its name from its two branches, which are said to look like the paths of two dragons (‘Ssangyong’ meaning ‘two dragons’ in Korean). It is thought that Ssangyonggul Cave and Hyeopjaegul Cave were once one cave since the second entrance of Ssangyonggul Cave is so close to the end of Hyeopjaegul Cave.","regDate":"2023-02-18","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-18-1676712970362/218751_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-18-1676712970362"},{"id":"2023-02-18-1676709536401","title":"Snoopy Garden (스누피가든)","description":"Snoopy Garden House is where visitors can meet Snoopy and friends from the popular American comic series Peanuts.

Each hole is separated from the other holes by a few meters.<br><br> Legend has it that Samseonghyeol is the place where three demigods, the founding fathers of Tamna (the former name of Jeju), first appeared. They lived by hunting and gathering until&nbsp;they married three princesses from Byeokrangguk, whom came to shore in a wooden box. The three princesses brought with them a calf, pony, and five different seeds that eventually helped to establish agriculture in Jeju.<br><br> Curiously, the three holes are not percolated by rain or snow.
