It wasn't until 1593 that the palace was used as a temporary palace of the royal family after their home was burned down during the Imjin War. King Seonjo also stayed at Deoksugung Palace after returning to the city. It became a proper palace when Gwanghaegun (1575-1641) ascended to the throne and gave this royal residence the name Gyeongungung Palace in 1611. Over the following decades, the palace alternated between being an official palace and a temporary residence. The name did not change officially to Deoksugung Palace, meaning the ‚Äúpalace of virtuous longevity,‚Äù until 1907. While the palace once encompassed a vast area with many buildings, the current palace grounds are just a small shadow of the prior splendor, with very few structures remaining.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-2-771-9951,<br>+82-2-751-0734, +82-2-751-0753|\n|parking:|Not available|\n|restdate:|Mondays|\n|usetime:|09:00-21:00 <BR>* Last admission 1 hour before closing|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|[Foreign Visitors]<br>Individuals - Adults 1,000 won / Children 500 won<br>Groups - Adults 800 won / Children 400 won<br><br>* Adults (ages 19-64) / Children (ages 7-18)<br>* Group: 10 people or more<br>* Free admission: Preschoolers (ages 6 & younger), senior citizens (ages 65 & older), visitors wearing hanbok, all visitors on the last Wednesday of each month (Culture Day) <br><br>[Combination Ticket for Palaces]<br>- Sites: Changdeokgung Palace, Changgyeonggung Palace, Deoksugung Palace, Gyeongbokgung Palace, Jongmyo Shrine <br>- Fee: 10,000 won (Note, refund not available after using the ticket the first time)<br>- Validity: Up to one month after purchase.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1569114_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1569114_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1569115_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1569115_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1569116_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1569116_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1956603_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1956603_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1956605_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1956605_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1956608_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1956608_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1956609_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1956609_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1956612_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1956612_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1956615_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1956615_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1956617_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1956617_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-2-771-9951](tel:+8227719951)\n- [üè†www.deoksugung.go.kr](http://www.deoksugung.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5661486714\nlongitude: 126.9749296905\ntitle: 99, Sejong-daero, Jung-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-22-1658472507467","title":"Deoksugung Palace (ÎçïÏàòÍ∂Å)","description":"Registered as Historic Site No. 124, Deoksugung Palace was initially not a royal palace, but a residential home of Grand Prince Wolsan (1454-1488), the older brother of King Seongjong (1469-1494) of the Joseon dynasty.

It is also the main gate of the palace, therefore larger and fancier in comparison to the other gates. Gwanghwamun Gate consists of three arched gates; the center gate was used by the king, while the other two were used by the crown prince and royal officials. The tall granite walls of the gate serve as a platform for the wooden gate tower that watches over the city. The gate has a sign with its name written at the top center of the gate tower. <br><br> Gwanghwamun Gate went through several damages and restorations over the course of history. It was first severely damaged during the Imjin War (1592-1598) and was not restored until the reconstruction of Gyeongbokgung Palace in 1864. Under the Japanese administration, the gate was demolished and relocated to the north of the palace's eastern gate, followed by series of damages during the Korean War (1950-1953). In 1968, Gwanghwamun Gate was relocated back to the south of the palace and was rebuilt using concrete; however, the gate‚Äôs position was shifted a few meters away from its original location. In 2006, a major reconstruction project took place to restore Gwanghwamun Gate to its original state and location, disassembling the structure completely and replacing concrete with granite and wood. After three years and eight months of construction, Gwanghwamun Gate was fully restored to its original form and was open to the public on August 15, 2010.","regDate":"2022-07-23","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Gates"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-23-1658581081718/1075281_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-07-23-1658581081718"}],"navList":["Busan","Daegu","Daejeon","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
