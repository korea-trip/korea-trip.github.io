After having the throne taken away by Suyang Daegun, his uncle, Danjong was condemned to exile in Yeongwol County, where he was later murdered and his remains were abandoned in the Donggang River. When no one else was brave enough to find his body, Eom Heung-do, the governor of Yeongwol Lake, found his body and buried him in the tomb that later became Jangneung, one of the royal tombs of the Joseon dynasty. Danjong had been stripped of his title at the time he was exiled. His title was later restored in year 1698, during the reign of King Sukjong, and received his posthumous name Danjong, and thereafter was referred to as King Danjong. <br><br>Jangneung houses such buildings as Jeongjagak, Baesikdansa, Jaesil, Yeongcheon, and Hongsammun, and a history hall with relics of Danjong. The area is surrounded by magnificent pine trees. Since 1967, a religious service called Danjongje is held every year on April 5th, according to the lunar calendar, in commemoration of Danjong.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-33-374-4215<br>+82-1577-0545|\n|parking:|Available (small-sized vehicles 100 / large vehicles 20)|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00 (Last admission 17:00)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Tour Course Information:|Jangneung - Bodeoksa Temple - Geummongam Rock - Cheongnyeong Falls - Gwangpungheon, Jaguryu - Geumgangjeong|\n|Admission Fees:|Individual - Adults 2,000 won / Teenagers 1,500 won / Children 1,000 won<br> Group - Adults 1,500 won / Teenagers 1,000 won / Children 800 won<br><br> * Group: 30 people or more<br>* Free for senior citizens aged 65 or over|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Guide in English, Japanese, Chinese available via QR code|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-10-01-1664600620874/564597_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-01-1664600620874/564597_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-01-1664600620874/564609_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-01-1664600620874/564609_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-01-1664600620874/564613_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-01-1664600620874/564613_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-01-1664600620874/1692344_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-01-1664600620874/1692344_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-01-1664600620874/1692346_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-01-1664600620874/1692346_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-01-1664600620874/1692361_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-01-1664600620874/1692361_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-01-1664600620874/1692367_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-01-1664600620874/1692367_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-01-1664600620874/1692372_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-01-1664600620874/1692372_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-01-1664600620874/2517632_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-01-1664600620874/2517632_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-01-1664600620874/564584_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-01-1664600620874/564584_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-33-374-4215](tel:+82333744215)\n- [üè†www.yw.go.kr</a> <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br> <a title=\"new window popup\" href=\"http://www.cha.go.kr/\" target=\"_blank\">www.cha.go.kr](http://www.yw.go.kr/tour)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.1973824361\nlongitude: 128.4519679070\ntitle: 190, Danjong-ro, Yeongwol-gun, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\n From Seoul Express Bus Terminal, take a bus to Yeongwol Bus Terminal. <br>\n In front of the bus terminal, take a city bus in the direction of Jojeolli.<br>\n Get off at Jangneung Bus Stop (approx. 15 min).<br>\n","data":{"id":"2022-10-01-1664600620874","title":"Jangneung Royal Tomb [UNESCO World Heritage] (ÏòÅÏõî Ïû•Î¶â(Îã®Ï¢Ö) [Ïú†ÎÑ§Ïä§ÏΩî ÏÑ∏Í≥ÑÎ¨∏ÌôîÏú†ÏÇ∞])","description":"Jangneung is the tomb of Danjong, the 6th king of the Joseon dynasty (r. 1441-1457).

The peak is made of strange rocks stretching from the foot of the mountain to the top at 900 m above sea level. The peak consists of six rocks, which create a majestic view of the rocky peak. The peak with the circumference of 4 km forms a great panoramic view along with Daecheongbong Peak and Outer Seorak. Ulsan Peak presents an imposing scene, and it was visited by many famous poets and calligraphers including Choe Yeon and Heo Jeok during the Joseon period who left behind their records. In addition, several legends are associated with Ulsan Peak. One day, a heavenly god commanded peaks of all mountains to assemble at Geumgangsan Mountain to create the greatest scenery. However, the Ulsan Peak was too heavy, so it was late for the meeting. Feeling ashamed, it didn‚Äôt go back home (Ulsan) directly, and took a rest at Seoraksan Mountain, but stayed there forever. Also, there is a saying that the peak was named after the shape of the rock, which resembles a fence (ul+tari) or a crying (ul) mountain (san). Visitors can get to the Ulsan Peak by starting from the small park and passing through Sinheungsa Temple and Heundeul Rock. At the beginning of the path, it starts with a gentle slope, but after the Heundeul Rock, there are a steep rocky hill and the iron stairs. It requires about 4 hr for getting to and from the peak. It is hard for the elderly or children to climb because of high level of difficulty.","regDate":"2022-10-16","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Resources","Rocks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-16-1665913620696/2711195_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-16-1665913620696"},{"id":"2022-10-16-1665910327005","title":"Uisangdae Pavilion (ÎÇôÏÇ∞ÏÇ¨ ÏùòÏÉÅÎåÄ)","description":"This pavilion is located on a seaside cliff on the way from Yangyang‚Äôs Naksansa Temple to Gwaneumgul Cave of Hongnyeonam Hermitage. The word ‚Äúdae‚Äù in Uisangdae refers to a building built at a vantage point for areas with beautiful scenery. Indeed, the view of the East Sea and the coast from Uisangdae Pavilion awarded its recognition as one of the Eight Sights of Yangyang, and a must-visit place for all visitors to Naksansa Temple. Jeong Cheol (pen-name  Songgang), a famed scholar and writer of the poem Song of Diamond Mountains, chose the pavilion as one of the Eight Sights of Gwandong, and the pavilion is today one of the popular sites for sunrise-viewing on the east coast of Korea. Together with Hongnyeonam Hermitage, it is designated as the Scenic Site No. 27 of Korea under the name ‚ÄúUisangdae Pavilion and Hongnyeonam Hermitage of Naksansa Temple, Yangyang.‚Äù Uisangdae is named after Uisang, a respected Silla-era Buddhist monk who is said to have founded this temple in 671 (11th year of King Munmu‚Äôs reign of Silla), and many stories of his deeds can still be found in the temple. For instance, Uisangdae is said to be the site where he meditated before founding Naksansa Temple at its present site. Today‚Äôs pavilion was restored to its present hexagonal form in 1995.","regDate":"2022-10-16","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-16-1665910327005/2711338_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-16-1665910327005"},{"id":"2022-10-16-1665906295356","title":"Uiamho Lake Skywalk (ÏùòÏïîÌò∏ Ïä§Ïπ¥Ïù¥ÏõåÌÅ¨)","description":"Uiamho Lake Skywalk, one of the two largest skywalks in Chuncheon along with Soyanggang Skywalk, is located on Uiamho Bike Path between Kim Youjeong Memorial Stone and Chuncheon Songam Sports Town in the Uiam Lakeside.

The entire floor is made of transparent glass, so visitors will feel like walking on the water. When you stand on the skywalk, you will encounter a picturesque view of Samaksan Mountain and Uiamho Lake. Soyanggang Skywalk boasts another splendid scenery of Chuncheon. Although the access from the Kim Youjeong Memorial Stone is close to Uiam Lake Skywalk, parking space is insufficient, thus, it is recommended to use the public parking lot near Chuncheon Songam Sports Town. It takes 15 min by foot or bike along the Uiamho Bike Path from the public parking lot to Uiam Lake Skywalk.
