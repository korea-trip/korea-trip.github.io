Miller purchased the land in 1962 and starting in 1970, many trees were planted in earnest. At that time, the park was only open to experts in related fields and members who helped fund the arboretum. In 2009, select sections of the arboretum were finally opened to the general public. The arboretum features more than 13,200 plants, including holly, magnolia, camelia, and maple trees, as well as five varieties of Rose of Sharon, the national flower.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-41-672-9982|\n|opendate:|1979|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|November-March 09:00-17:00 / April-October 09:00-18:00<BR>Extended operation: Saturdays April 10 - May 22 09:00-19:00 / July 18 - August 15 09:00-19:00 <br>* Last admission 1 hr before closing|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Areas Open to the Public:|Miller Garden|\n|Shopping Information:|Holly Shop, Holly Cafe|\n|Facility Utilization Fees:|Refer to the official website|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Miller Garden, exhibition hall, Garden Stay, etc.|\n|Admission Fees:|March-November: Adults 9,000 won / Teenagers & senior citizens 6,000 won / Children 5,000 won<br>December-February: Adults 6,000 won / Teenagers & senior citizens 5,000 won / Children 4,000 won<br><br> * Adults (ages 19-64) / Children (ages 4-18) / Senior citizens (ages 65 and over) <br> * Group discount: 1,000 won discount for 30 people or more<BR>* Free admission: Preschoolers (ages 3 and under)|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-02-1667378919698/2653795_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-02-1667378919698/2653795_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-02-1667378919698/2653796_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-02-1667378919698/2653796_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-02-1667378919698/2653801_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-02-1667378919698/2653801_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-02-1667378919698/2653803_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-02-1667378919698/2653803_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-02-1667378919698/1649646_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-02-1667378919698/1649646_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-02-1667378919698/2653793_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-02-1667378919698/2653793_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-02-1667378919698/2653794_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-02-1667378919698/2653794_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-02-1667378919698/2653802_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-02-1667378919698/2653802_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-02-1667378919698/2653804_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-02-1667378919698/2653804_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-41-672-9982](tel:+82416729982)\n- [üè†www.chollipo.org](http://www.chollipo.org)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.7943735798\nlongitude: 126.1437513290\ntitle: 187, Cheollipo 1-gil, Taean-gun, Chungcheongnam-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-02-1667378919698","title":"Cheollipo Arboretum (Ï≤úÎ¶¨Ìè¨ÏàòÎ™©Ïõê)","description":"Cheollipo Arboretum is located on the tip of the Taean peninsula, and was founded by Carl Ferris Miller, the blue-eyed Korean.

A breakwater was built around this area, which created Ganwolho Lake and Bunamho Lake. Moreover, a vast agricultural land spanning 6,400 hectares was formed on what used to be a mud flat. The monthly average temperature of Cheonsuman Bay area between October and March is about 1.2 degree Celsius higher than inland areas at the same latitude because of its oceanic climate. Such geographical conditions have made Cheonsuman Bay an ideal wintering site for migratory birds.<br><br>Cheonsuman Bay is located midway along the migration route of birds migrating from northern Siberia or Manchuria to Southeast Asia. As a result, Cheonsuman Bay has become home to nearly 200 different species of migratory birds that can be watched all year round. In winter, the area becomes a wintering site for over 300 thousand ducks and wild geese, as well as a wide variety of endangered species like storks, spoonbills, mute swans, and white-naped cranes. Lucky birdwatchers might be able to witness the great spectacle created by tens of thousands of migratory birds flying in a flock over the Cheonsuman Bay area.","regDate":"2022-11-03","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongnam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Eco-Tourism Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-03-1667465297913/2716584_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Chungcheongnam-do/2022-11-03-1667465297913"},{"id":"2022-11-03-1667461081853","title":"Cheonjangho Lake (Ï≤úÏû•Ìò∏)","description":"Cheonjangho Lake is situated on the ridge of Chilgapsan Mountain about 11 kilometers away from the Chilgapsan Recreational Forest.
