Lee Seong-rye, the mother of Father Thomas Choi Yang-eop (Korea's second ordained priest), has not yet been canonized although she did suffer martyrdom. The reason was that the mother briefly put aside her faith because of the pressures of raising five children after she had her oldest son, Thomas. However, the difficulty of combining these two interests was eventually overcome and she died a martyr.<br><br>Aside from serving as a memorial site, Danggogae Catholic Martyrs' Shrine also offers a commanding view of Seoul. Nearby tourist attractions include Saenamteo Catholic Holy Place of the Martyrs, which is a Catholic church with Korean architecture, and Yongsan Family Park.","regDate":"2022-07-22","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Holy Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-22-1658463869048/566486_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-07-22-1658463869048"},{"id":"2022-07-22-1658457979582","title":"Daehangno (University Street) (ÎåÄÌïôÎ°ú)","description":"Daehangno is an artistic neighborhood that stretches 1.1 kilometers from Jongno 5-ga Intersection to Hyehwa-dong Rotary.

As the number of followers increased, the building underwent construction and officially became a church in 1895. Chungdong Church is the only remaining church building from the 19th century. The church was expanded once more in 1926, changing its from a cross-shaped building to a square one. The expansion was made by adding walls using bricks as not to damage the original building structure.
