Inside the Jeongmyeolbogung there is no statue of Buddha and only a wide open window. This is because it is believed that the mountain as a whole is the enshrined Jinsinsari of Buddha himself.<br><br>Beopheungsa was once a large temple where over 2,000 monks gathered. Today, most of the temple buildings were lost to a number of fires leaving only a few buildings. The pine wood path from Beopheungsa Temple to Jeongmyeolbogung is one of the most picturesque sites in the nation. The location was originally named Sajasansa but later changed to Sajasan Jeongmyeolbogung in 1939. In addition to the path, the nine peaks (Gubongdae) lined up one after another forms another charming view.","regDate":"2022-10-19","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-19-1666161866197/2370006_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-19-1666161866197"},{"id":"2022-10-19-1666156374510","title":"Yeongok Beach (Ïó∞Í≥°Ìï¥Î≥Ä(Ïó∞Í≥°Ìï¥ÏàòÏöïÏû•))","description":"Situated in Yeongok-myeon, Dongdeok-ri, Yeongok Beach has a spacious sandy shore that spans 56,000 „é° with a length of 700 meters.
