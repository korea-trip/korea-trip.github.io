The entrance of the school is marked with a large traditional \"Neowa\" (a house roofed with thick, unfinished shingles of pine) that immediately catches the eye.  \n<br><br>\nThe school provides three types of courses. There is a basic carpentry course to teach people how to make wooden objects and structures, a course to nurture professional carpenters, and a course to teach carpenters how to build Hanok. The school‚Äôs hands-on programs offer visitors a chance to make a traditional Korean window and to saw and plane wood. There are cultural programs for children as well.
