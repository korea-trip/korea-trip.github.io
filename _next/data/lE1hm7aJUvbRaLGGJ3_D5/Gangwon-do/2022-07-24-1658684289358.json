The main ridge of the mountain stretches between the city of Taebaek to the east and Yeongwol and Jeongseon counties to the west. The mountain offers a fine vantage point from which to get a sweeping look at the entire region (including Taebaeksan and Baegunsan mountains) and commands a striking view of the sunrise over East Sea. The three starting points for hiking Hambaeksan Mountain are Dumundongjae Pass, Manhangjae Pass, and the entrance to the Jeokjoam Hermitage. The hiking path that begins at Dumundongjae Pass and leads to the peak is especially recommended for its scenic views. Hambaeksan Mountain is particularly well known for its breathtaking snowscapes and extensive wildflower beds. <br><br>Hambaeksan Mountain is also home to Jeongamsa Temple, which was built by Buddhist monk Jajangyulsa in the year 636 during the reign of Queen Seondeok of the Silla Kingdom. The temple is home to the Sumanotap Pagoda (Treasure No. 410) and is bordered by a stream that provides a natural habitat for the Brachmystax lenok (Natural Monument No. 73), a member of the trout family.","regDate":"2022-09-27","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-27-1664260173664/1822209_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-09-27-1664260173664"},{"id":"2022-09-27-1664254875010","title":"Hajodae Unmanned Lighthouse (ÌïòÏ°∞ÎåÄ Î¨¥Ïù∏Îì±ÎåÄ)","description":"The Hajodae Unmanned Lighthouse sits along a cliff with an old pine tree and overlooks the East Sea.

Gwangjeongcheon and Sanguncheon Streams run into the ocean near the beach, creating slightly warmer waters than other areas along the eastern coast. During the summer season, visitors can pay to pitch a tent on the beach or in the pine forest campground. The beach is complete with a parking lot, shower booth, drinking fountain, and restroom among other amenities. The beach is open for swimming between July and August, and is the venue for many festivals and events throughout the year.

Its 135,000 m2 seaside is made up of the mysterious rock formations and rocky islands of the East Sea, a sight that has, along with the nearby pine forests, given the area a distinguished place among the Eight Sights. The name of the beach, Hajodae, is said to come from Ha Ryun and Jo Jun, two late Goryeo-era officials who plotted to overthrow the dynasty and would eventually become one of the founding officials of Joseon. A pavilion, also named Hajodae, can be found on top of the coastal cliff. Today‚Äôs pavilion is a restoration dating back to 1998, while the original was established during the reign of King Jeongjong of the Joseon Dynasty and underwent numerous renovations. The pavilion is the favored point of view for many visitors. An old pine tree standing upright on the rocky cliff was made famous for its appearance on the broadcasted screen for the national anthem of Korea. Following the decked walkways from the pavilion brings one to the white unmanned lighthouse, or the nearby Hajodae Trail and Observatory. Hajodae Beach can be found about 1 km to the northwest of the area. Its relatively shallow depth, reaching no more than 1.5 m, makes it ideal for families with small children.","regDate":"2022-09-26","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-26-1664185593717/2711324_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-09-26-1664185593717"},{"id":"2022-09-26-1664182522172","title":"Haegasa Site (Surobuin Park) (Ìï¥Í∞ÄÏÇ¨Ïùò ÌÑ∞(ÏàòÎ°úÎ∂ÄÏù∏Í≥µÏõê))","description":"Haegasa is a site named after the tale of Haega in The Heritage of the Three States.
