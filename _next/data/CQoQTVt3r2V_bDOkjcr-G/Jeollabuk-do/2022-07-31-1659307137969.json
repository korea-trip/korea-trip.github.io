The origin of the name \"Gaeam\" goes back to 282 BC, when King Mun from the Byeonhan confederacy took refuge here during the revolt of the Jinhan and Mahan confederacies. Under King Mun's command, temples for the new fortress were built on east and west sides of the valley; the western temple was called Gaeam. In 676, the temple was expanded and in 1276, thirty more buildings were raised, expanding it to a grand temple.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|accomcount:|No limit|\n|expagerange:|Open to visitors age 5 & over|\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<BR> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-63-581-0080|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604186_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604186_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604187_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604187_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604188_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604188_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604189_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604189_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604190_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604190_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604191_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604191_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604192_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604192_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604306_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604306_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604307_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604307_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604308_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604308_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-63-581-0080](tel:+82635810080)\n- [üè†www.gaeamsa.org</a><br /><a href=\"http://gaeamsa.templestay.com\" target=\"_blank\">gaeamsa.templestay.com](http://www.gaeamsa.org)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.6628507594\nlongitude: 126.6498267208\ntitle: 248, Gaeam-ro, Buan-gun, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-31-1659307137969","title":"Gaeamsa Temple (Í∞úÏïîÏÇ¨)","description":"Gaeamsa Temple is a small, quiet temple built in 634 during the Baekje dynasty.

According to the Samguk Sagi (history of the three kingdoms), Byeokgolje was first built in the 21st year of the reign of King Heulhae (AD 330) of the Silla Kingdom. However, this region belonged to the Baekje kingdom at that time, so some counter that the embankment was actually built in the 27th year of King Biryou (AD 330) of the Baekje kingdom. Historians agree, however, that the reservoir was mended by King Wonseong of Silla in AD 790 and by King Hyeonjong and King Injong of the Goryeo Dynasty in AD 1143. In 1415, King Taejong of the Joseon dynasty rebuilt the whole facility, but it was washed away in heavy rains five years later in the 2nd year of King Sejong.  <br><br>Only about three kilometers of the reservoir embankment remain intact today. Moreover, the original embankment underwent major transformations in 1925 when the Dongjin Land Improvement Association remolded it into a channel for carrying water to nearby fields. <br><br>In 1975, an archeological study of the sites where the two floodgates once stood revealed that highly refined measuring techniques had been used in the original construction of the reservoir. Thus, despite its many changes, Byeokgolje not only holds significance as Korea‚Äôs oldest manmade reservoir, but also as a historical relic that points to the highly developed engineering technology of the past.","regDate":"2022-08-01","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-01-1659337204897/1603977_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2022-08-01-1659337204897"},{"id":"2022-08-01-1659333898212","title":"Geumsansa Temple (Gimje) (Í∏àÏÇ∞ÏÇ¨(ÍπÄÏ†ú))","description":"Located near the entrance of the Moaksan Provincial Park, Geumsansa Temple was established in the first year of King Beop of the Baekje Kingdom (AD 599).
