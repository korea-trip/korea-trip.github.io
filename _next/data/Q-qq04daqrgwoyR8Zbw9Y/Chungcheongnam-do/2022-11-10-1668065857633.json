The beach has a length of 1.5 kilometers and x_width of 50 meters. The water level is 1-2 meters and the water temperature is approximately 22 degrees Celsius. The surrounding pine forest is lush and beautiful. In particular, there is a fishing spot with a large rock formation in front of the beach. For one to two days each month, there is a phenomenon also know as Moses Miracle that opens a 1.5-kilometer-long road in the sea. This mysterious sea road was thought to only appear during summer, however it was revealed that it actually occurs every lunar month. In 1996, the beach was open to the general public. <br><br> The red lighthouse towering at the end of the long breakwater is as impressive as a picture. The pretty pensions right in front of the sandy beach add to the scenery. Also, Daecheonhang Port is a 20 minutes drive away, and there visitors can enjoy fresh seafood and grilled shellfish at an affordable price.","regDate":"2022-11-10","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongnam-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-10-1668062832249/2022140_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Chungcheongnam-do/2022-11-10-1668062832249","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Chungcheongnam-do/2022-11-10-1668062832249"},{"id":"2022-11-10-1668059034509","title":"Mongsanpo Beach (Î™ΩÏÇ∞Ìè¨Ìï¥ÏàòÏöïÏû•)","description":"Mongsanpo Beach, part of Taeanhaean National Park, stretches 18 kilometers southwest of Seosan, 9 kilometers south of Taean and along the west coast of the Nammyeon Peninsula.

The pine tree forest along the beach serves as a good auto-camping location to enjoy some fresh air and the natural beauty of the surroundings. During low tide, the muddy sediments deposited by the tide provide a place where people come to catch clams and mud crabs or as a field trip for children to learn the mudflat ecosystem. <br><br>A 1-kilometer drive in the western direction while passing through the spectacular pine tree tunnel brings visitors to Mongdaepogu Port where a number of fishing boats are docked.
