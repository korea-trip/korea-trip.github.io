The source water originates from the Jangcheoncheon Stream, passing through the lake, and goes to the East Sea via the waterway under the Yeongnanggyo Bridge. The lake is adjacent to the areas of Jangsa-dong, Yeongnang-dong, Dongmyeong-dong, and Geumho-dong. The pleasant trail is also established around the lakeside, surrounded by the beautiful scenery of cherry blossoms, azaleas, and reeds. According to Samguk yusa (Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms), the name of the lake comes from Silla‚Äôs hwarang (elite warrior group in Silla) member named ‚ÄúYeongnang.‚Äù After training at Geumgangsan Mountain, Yeongnang passed this lake on the way to get to the martial arts competition. As he was so taken by the splendid landscape, however, he forgot about the competition and stayed here for a long time. As the old record says, Yeongnangho Lake boasts outstanding scenery. Beombawi Rock, in particular, evokes visitors‚Äô admiration as one of the Eight Sights of Sokcho. The rock, which resembles the shape of a tiger crouching down, has an aura of mystery. The nearby tourist attractions also include Gwaneumam Rock, which is known for the strange rocks and bizarre stones, Bogwangsa Temple, and the Wetland Eco Park, which is located in the west of the lakeside.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-33-639-2690|\n|parking:|Not available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Open 24 hr|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-10-18-1666090450530/677375_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-18-1666090450530/677375_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-18-1666090450530/2494926_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-18-1666090450530/2494926_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-18-1666090450530/2494928_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-18-1666090450530/2494928_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-18-1666090450530/2711166_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-18-1666090450530/2711166_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-18-1666090450530/2711167_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-18-1666090450530/2711167_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-18-1666090450530/2711168_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-18-1666090450530/2711168_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-18-1666090450530/2711169_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-18-1666090450530/2711169_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-18-1666090450530/2494930_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-18-1666090450530/2494930_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-33-639-2690](tel:+82336392690)\n- [üè†www.sokchotour.com](http://www.sokchotour.com)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 38.2142227476\nlongitude: 128.5807503766\ntitle: 140, Yeongnanghoban-gil, Sokcho-si, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Dong Seoul Bus Terminal, take a bus to Sokcho Express Bus Terminal.<br>\nFrom Sokcho Express Bus Terminal Bus Stop, take Bus No. 7-1 or 9-1 and get off at Yeongnanggyo Bridge Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-10-18-1666090450530","title":"Yeongnangho Lake (ÏòÅÎûëÌò∏)","description":"Yeongnangho Lake is a deep and large lake with a circumference of 7.8 km, an area of about 1.2 km2, and a depth of over 8 m, formed by the development of coastal dunes.

As hinted by its names meaning bare mountain, there are few trees near its summit. Locals also refer to it as Eoksaesan (silver grass) Mountain because of the waves of eulalia covering its sides. The mountain remains this way because villagers burned the fields once a year to encourage the growth of wild herbs.<br><br>The mountain‚Äôs gradual slope offers an enjoyable trekking experience for hikers of all levels. In mid-October, waist-high silver grass is indeed everywhere, making it challenging for hikers to view the surrounding areas. Fortunately, certain spots near the peak offer breathtaking views of the gentle ridges and flowing hillsides.<br><br>Silver grass begins blooming in September and reaches peak colors between October and November. The Silver Grass Festival is held on Mindungsan Mountain every October, attracting hundreds of thousands of attendees for a wonderful outdoor hiking experience and picturesque photo opportunities. The mountain is easily accessible by train allowing visitors from near and far to enjoy the fall colors.<br><br>On the outskirts of Mindungsan Mountain near Balgudeok village is Goebyeonggol Valley, which contains magnificent rock formations and limestone caves.
