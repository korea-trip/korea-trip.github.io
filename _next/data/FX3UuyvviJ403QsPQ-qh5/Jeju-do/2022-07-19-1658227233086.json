The first waterfall falls into a pond with a depth of 21 meters. From here, it falls two more times, creating the second and third waterfalls, which then flow into the sea. To the east of the first waterfall is a cave, where water falls from the ceiling. In the past, people believed this water had healing properties, with many people bathing in the waters. These days, swimming is strictly prohibited. In Cheonjeyeon Valley, visitors can see Seonimgyo Bridge (arch bridge with 7 nymphs carved on the side) and the octagonal Cheonjeru Pavilion. Seonimgyo Bridge is also called Chilseonyeogyo, meaning \"seven nymphs bridge,\" and it connects Cheonjeyeon Falls with Jungmum Tourist Complex. <br><br>\n\nOn the surface of Cheonjeru Pavilion, there is a painting that tells Cheonjeyeon‚Äôs legend of the seven nymphs and the mountain god.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-64-760-6331|\n|parking:|Available|\n|usetime:|09:00-19:00 <br> * Last ticketing 1 hr. before closing|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 2,500 won / Children 1,350 won <br>Groups - Adults 2,050 won / Children 850 won <br><br> * Free admission: Preschoolers (ages 6 & younger), senior citizens (ages 65 & older)<br> * Group: 10 or more people<br>* Adults (ages 25-64) / Children (ages 7-24)|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-19-1658227233086/2650702_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658227233086/2650702_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658227233086/2650703_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658227233086/2650703_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658227233086/2650705_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658227233086/2650705_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658227233086/2650706_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658227233086/2650706_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658227233086/2650707_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658227233086/2650707_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-64-760-6331](tel:+82647606331)\n- [üè†www.visitjeju.net](http://www.visitjeju.net/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.2526559999\nlongitude: 126.4184294967\ntitle: 132, Cheonjeyeon-ro, Seogwipo-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Jeju Airport, take Airport Limosine Bus 600 bound for Jungmun and get off at Yeomiji Botanical Garden Bus Stop.<br>Walk for approx. 5-10 min.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-19-1658227233086","title":"Cheonjeyeonpokpo Falls (Ï≤úÏ†úÏó∞Ìè≠Ìè¨)","description":"Cheonjeyeonpokpo Falls, named \"The Pond of God,\" consists of three sections.

With no entrance as such, the cave is not open to the general public and thus its original form remains preserved to this day, giving it a high geological value. <Br><Br> Although the Dangcheomuldonggul Cave is technically a lava tube, it resembles a limestone cave due to the secondary geological formations of lime substances that have accumulated in the ground above the tube. The tunnel has a spectacular and mystical beauty with countless stalactites and stalagmites, as well as stalactite columns. The particularly thin stalactites and stalactic columns in this cave are well-known for their uniqueness and beauty. Although this is a relatively small lava tunnel, its exotic colors and the richness of the secondary topological formations make it extraordinary in terms of research value.

Records show people have been living on the islands since as long as 1271, during the reign of Goryeo King Wonjong, at which point they were referred to as Hupungdo Islands, serving as a safe harbor for ships sailing between Jeju and the mainland. The name changed to Chujado Islands during the Joseon dynasty due to the lush forest of walnut trees, chuja in the Jeollanam-do dialect. The ocean around the islands is a popular place for sea fishing, while the islands themselves offer outstanding views of nature along a Jeju Olle Trail Course.","regDate":"2023-02-15","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-15-1676446569108/870922_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-15-1676446569108"},{"id":"2023-02-15-1676443201688","title":"Byeoldobong Peak (Beri Oreum) (Î≥ÑÎèÑÎ¥â(Î≤†Î¶¨Ïò§Î¶Ñ))","description":"Situated in the east of Hwabuk 1-dong and along the coast, Byeoldobong is a parasitic mountain made of siliciclastic sedimentary rocks and lava.

Created particularly close to the earth‚Äôs surface, this cave has a number of entrance holes to the tunnel. Inside, the complex structure of the cave unfolds in the form of double-tiered or triple-tiered rooms.

Legend has it that the pond was created by the water raining down off of a dragon that ascended to heaven.
