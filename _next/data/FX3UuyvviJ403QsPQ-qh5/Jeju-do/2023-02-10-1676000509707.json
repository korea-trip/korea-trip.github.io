The lava tube stretches roughly 7,400 meters, with a maximum x_height of 25 meters and x_width of 18 meters. These measurements make it one of the largest lava tubes in the world. Manjanggul holds great value for science and conservation studies, having well-maintained formations despite being formed over one hundred thousand years ago.<br><br>The majority of the cave is closed off, with only 1 kilometer being open to tourists. Within this open section, visitors can see a variety of lava tube and cave topographical features, including stalagtites, stalagmites, and stone pillars. Among these, the 7.6-meter-tall stone pillar at the end of the open section is recorded as the largest in the world.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-64-710-3945,<br>+82-64-710-7903|\n|parking:|Available (Large vehicles: 60 spaces / Small vehicles: 75 spaces)|\n|restdate:|First Wednesday of every month|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00<br>* Last admission 17:10<br>* Docent tours 09:00-17:00 (free; onsite registration)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 4,000 won / Teenagers & Children 2,000 won<br />Groups - Adults 3,000 won / Teenagers & Children 1,500 won<br /><br /> * Group: 10 or more people<br /> * Adults (ages 25-64) / Teenagers (ages 13-24) / Children (ages 7-12)|\n  \n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-64-710-3945](tel:+82647103945)\n- [üè†www.jeju.go.kr](http://www.jeju.go.kr/jejuwnh/heritage/lavatube/manjanggul.htm)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.5280478463\nlongitude: 126.7706788052\ntitle: 182, Manjanggul-gil, Jeju-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Jeju International Airport, take Bus No. 101 to Haenyeo Museum Bus Stop.<br>\nFrom Haenyeo Museum Bus Stop, transfer to Bus No. 711-1 and get off at Manjanggul Cave Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2023-02-10-1676000509707","title":"Manjanggul Lava Tube [National Geopark] (ÎßåÏû•Íµ¥ (Ï†úÏ£ºÎèÑ Íµ≠Í∞ÄÏßÄÏßàÍ≥µÏõê))","description":"Manjanggul Lava Tube, located in Gimnyeong-ri, Jeju, is part of the Geomunoreum Lava Tube system.

With no entrance as such, the cave is not open to the general public and thus its original form remains preserved to this day, giving it a high geological value. <Br><Br> Although the Dangcheomuldonggul Cave is technically a lava tube, it resembles a limestone cave due to the secondary geological formations of lime substances that have accumulated in the ground above the tube. The tunnel has a spectacular and mystical beauty with countless stalactites and stalagmites, as well as stalactite columns. The particularly thin stalactites and stalactic columns in this cave are well-known for their uniqueness and beauty. Although this is a relatively small lava tunnel, its exotic colors and the richness of the secondary topological formations make it extraordinary in terms of research value.

Records show people have been living on the islands since as long as 1271, during the reign of Goryeo King Wonjong, at which point they were referred to as Hupungdo Islands, serving as a safe harbor for ships sailing between Jeju and the mainland. The name changed to Chujado Islands during the Joseon dynasty due to the lush forest of walnut trees, chuja in the Jeollanam-do dialect. The ocean around the islands is a popular place for sea fishing, while the islands themselves offer outstanding views of nature along a Jeju Olle Trail Course.","regDate":"2023-02-15","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-15-1676446569108/870922_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-15-1676446569108"},{"id":"2023-02-15-1676443201688","title":"Byeoldobong Peak (Beri Oreum) (Î≥ÑÎèÑÎ¥â(Î≤†Î¶¨Ïò§Î¶Ñ))","description":"Situated in the east of Hwabuk 1-dong and along the coast, Byeoldobong is a parasitic mountain made of siliciclastic sedimentary rocks and lava.

Inside, the complex structure of the cave unfolds in the form of double-tiered or triple-tiered rooms.

Legend has it that the pond was created by the water raining down off of a dragon that ascended to heaven.
