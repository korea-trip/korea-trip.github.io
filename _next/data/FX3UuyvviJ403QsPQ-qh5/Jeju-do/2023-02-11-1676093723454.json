It is located on the southeast side of Jeju, and is a flat crater, about 650 meters wide, 100 meters deep, and 2,070 meters in circumference. If you look at the crater from above up, it looks like a man-made circular stadium. There is a variety of plant-life in the crater.  On the north side, Nandaeseong vegetation such as red-thorn trees, and magnolia trees grow, along with the rare winter strawberries.  On the south side of the crater, Ondaerim vegetation such as evergreens, maples, and mountain strawberry trees cover the area.  Because so many different kinds of trees and plants grow in such a limited space, it attracts the attention of researchers as well.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-64-783-9900|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A Open all year round|\n|usetime:|March-October 09:00-18:40<br>November-February 09:00-17:40<br>* Last admission 40 min before closing<br>* Closing hours are subject to change depending on weather conditions.|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Film Locations:|Movie ‚Äò‚ÄôLove Wind, Love Song (1999)‚Äù<br>Drama ‚ÄúGoddess of Marriage (2013)‚Äù|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 6,000 won / Teenagers 4,000 won / Children 3,000 won<br>Groups - Adults 5,000 won / Teenagers 2,500 won / Children 2,500 won<br><br>* Groups: 20 people or more|\n|Available Facilities:|Pavilion, silver grass field, mineral spring, resting area, local restaurant, free storage room, etc.|\n  \n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-64-783-9900](tel:+82647839900)\n- [üè†www.sangumburi.net ](http://www.sangumburi.net)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.4323127375\nlongitude: 126.6928183084\ntitle: 768, Bijarim-ro, Jeju-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Taxi]<br>\nApprox. 40 min from Jeju International Airport.\n","data":{"id":"2023-02-11-1676093723454","title":"Sangumburi Crater (ÏÇ∞ÍµºÎ∂ÄÎ¶¨)","description":"Sangumburi Crater has been designated as a Natural Monument.

With no entrance as such, the cave is not open to the general public and thus its original form remains preserved to this day, giving it a high geological value. <Br><Br> Although the Dangcheomuldonggul Cave is technically a lava tube, it resembles a limestone cave due to the secondary geological formations of lime substances that have accumulated in the ground above the tube. The tunnel has a spectacular and mystical beauty with countless stalactites and stalagmites, as well as stalactite columns. The particularly thin stalactites and stalactic columns in this cave are well-known for their uniqueness and beauty. Although this is a relatively small lava tunnel, its exotic colors and the richness of the secondary topological formations make it extraordinary in terms of research value.

Records show people have been living on the islands since as long as 1271, during the reign of Goryeo King Wonjong, at which point they were referred to as Hupungdo Islands, serving as a safe harbor for ships sailing between Jeju and the mainland. The name changed to Chujado Islands during the Joseon dynasty due to the lush forest of walnut trees, chuja in the Jeollanam-do dialect. The ocean around the islands is a popular place for sea fishing, while the islands themselves offer outstanding views of nature along a Jeju Olle Trail Course.","regDate":"2023-02-15","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-15-1676446569108/870922_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-15-1676446569108"},{"id":"2023-02-15-1676443201688","title":"Byeoldobong Peak (Beri Oreum) (Î≥ÑÎèÑÎ¥â(Î≤†Î¶¨Ïò§Î¶Ñ))","description":"Situated in the east of Hwabuk 1-dong and along the coast, Byeoldobong is a parasitic mountain made of siliciclastic sedimentary rocks and lava.

For geologists, this cave is invaluable since it demonstrates how lava continuously flowed over the surface of the ground and the complex route it took to eventually form a tube deep underground. Created particularly close to the earth‚Äôs surface, this cave has a number of entrance holes to the tunnel. Inside, the complex structure of the cave unfolds in the form of double-tiered or triple-tiered rooms.

Legend has it that the pond was created by the water raining down off of a dragon that ascended to heaven. The name, meaning Dragon Pond, also comes from the belief that the dragon of Yongduam (Dragon Head Rock) just 200 meters to the west would come to this pond to play.","regDate":"2023-02-15","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-15-1676435981715/197824_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-15-1676435981715"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
