During low tide, the beach looks like an elegant circle, and it becomes a circular lake less than 1 meter deep during high tide, and displays many different colors. The beach is a great place for children to play and for watching the sunrise. The sand on the beach is formed out of broken shells, and sand baths are believed to be effective for people suffering from neuralgia. Every August, this beautiful beach hosts the Pyoseon White Sand Festival, which offers fun and colorful events. The beach is equipped with excellent amenities (a campground, abundant parking space, dressing rooms and shower rooms) and surrounded by nearby attractions, such as Seongeup Folk Village and Jeju Folk Village Museum.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ Jeju Travel Hotline: +82-64-740-6000|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Shower booth, parasol, park, snack bar, etc.|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-02-10-1676018430175/1618202_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-10-1676018430175/1618202_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-10-1676018430175/1618203_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-10-1676018430175/1618203_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-10-1676018430175/1618204_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-10-1676018430175/1618204_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-10-1676018430175/1618205_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-10-1676018430175/1618205_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-10-1676018430175/1618206_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-10-1676018430175/1618206_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-10-1676018430175/1618207_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-10-1676018430175/1618207_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-10-1676018430175/1618208_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-10-1676018430175/1618208_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-64-740-6000](tel:+82647406000)\n- [üè†www.visitjeju.net](http://www.visitjeju.net=)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.3256435401\nlongitude: 126.8396357961\ntitle: Minsokhaean-ro, Seogwipo-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2023-02-10-1676018430175","title":"Pyoseon Haevich Beach (ÌëúÏÑ† Ìï¥ÎπÑÏπò Ìï¥Î≥Ä)","description":"Pyoseon Beach in Seogwipo is a spacious beach, taking up more than 150,000 m¬≤.

With no entrance as such, the cave is not open to the general public and thus its original form remains preserved to this day, giving it a high geological value. <Br><Br> Although the Dangcheomuldonggul Cave is technically a lava tube, it resembles a limestone cave due to the secondary geological formations of lime substances that have accumulated in the ground above the tube. The tunnel has a spectacular and mystical beauty with countless stalactites and stalagmites, as well as stalactite columns. The particularly thin stalactites and stalactic columns in this cave are well-known for their uniqueness and beauty. Although this is a relatively small lava tunnel, its exotic colors and the richness of the secondary topological formations make it extraordinary in terms of research value.

Records show people have been living on the islands since as long as 1271, during the reign of Goryeo King Wonjong, at which point they were referred to as Hupungdo Islands, serving as a safe harbor for ships sailing between Jeju and the mainland. The name changed to Chujado Islands during the Joseon dynasty due to the lush forest of walnut trees, chuja in the Jeollanam-do dialect.
