The river has created a valley with many interesting and uniquely shaped rocks as it flowed down the mountainside over the years. The waters are so pure, the small pebbles and sand lining the bottom of the stream can be seen clearly. There are a number of areas along the stream perfect for relaxing and enjoying some time in nature. Many families visit and enjoy fishing and the pure environment. The river is also well-known for rafting.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline:+82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br> • For more info: +82-33-249-3881|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year around)|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-10-06-1665036082838/185539_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665036082838/185539_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-06-1665036082838/1693876_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665036082838/1693876_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-06-1665036082838/1693878_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665036082838/1693878_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-06-1665036082838/1693890_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665036082838/1693890_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-06-1665036082838/1693896_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665036082838/1693896_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-06-1665036082838/2616269_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665036082838/2616269_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-06-1665036082838/2616270_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665036082838/2616270_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-06-1665036082838/2616272_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665036082838/2616272_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-06-1665036082838/2616273_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665036082838/2616273_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-06-1665036082838/1637456_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665036082838/1637456_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-33-249-3881](tel:+82332493881)\n- [🏠www.koreadmz.kr](http://www.koreadmz.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.9653962072\nlongitude: 128.2965060925\ntitle: Buk-ri, Girin-myeon, Inje-gun, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Express/Intercity Bus]<br>\nTake a bus from Dong Seoul Bus Terminal to Inje Bus Terminal.<br><br>\n\n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Inje Bus Terminal, take a bus bound for Hyeonri and get off at Riverside Park Bus Stop.\n<br><br>\n[Taxi]<br>\nApprox. 15min from Inje Bus Terminal\n","data":{"id":"2022-10-06-1665036082838","title":"Naerincheon River Pothole-Gangwon Peace National Geopark (내린천 포트홀-강원평화지역 국가지질공원)","description":"Naerincheon River starts out as a small stream on Bungnyongsan Mountain and flows down Sogyebangsan Mountain before joining with other small valley streams to create the larger river that most people know.

The peak is made of strange rocks stretching from the foot of the mountain to the top at 900 m above sea level. The peak consists of six rocks, which create a majestic view of the rocky peak. The peak with the circumference of 4 km forms a great panoramic view along with Daecheongbong Peak and Outer Seorak. Ulsan Peak presents an imposing scene, and it was visited by many famous poets and calligraphers including Choe Yeon and Heo Jeok during the Joseon period who left behind their records. In addition, several legends are associated with Ulsan Peak. One day, a heavenly god commanded peaks of all mountains to assemble at Geumgangsan Mountain to create the greatest scenery. However, the Ulsan Peak was too heavy, so it was late for the meeting. Feeling ashamed, it didn’t go back home (Ulsan) directly, and took a rest at Seoraksan Mountain, but stayed there forever. Also, there is a saying that the peak was named after the shape of the rock, which resembles a fence (ul+tari) or a crying (ul) mountain (san). Visitors can get to the Ulsan Peak by starting from the small park and passing through Sinheungsa Temple and Heundeul Rock. At the beginning of the path, it starts with a gentle slope, but after the Heundeul Rock, there are a steep rocky hill and the iron stairs. It requires about 4 hr for getting to and from the peak. It is hard for the elderly or children to climb because of high level of difficulty.","regDate":"2022-10-16","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Resources","Rocks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-16-1665913620696/2711195_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-16-1665913620696"},{"id":"2022-10-16-1665910327005","title":"Uisangdae Pavilion (낙산사 의상대)","description":"This pavilion is located on a seaside cliff on the way from Yangyang’s Naksansa Temple to Gwaneumgul Cave of Hongnyeonam Hermitage. The word “dae” in Uisangdae refers to a building built at a vantage point for areas with beautiful scenery. Indeed, the view of the East Sea and the coast from Uisangdae Pavilion awarded its recognition as one of the Eight Sights of Yangyang, and a must-visit place for all visitors to Naksansa Temple. Jeong Cheol (pen-name  Songgang), a famed scholar and writer of the poem Song of Diamond Mountains, chose the pavilion as one of the Eight Sights of Gwandong, and the pavilion is today one of the popular sites for sunrise-viewing on the east coast of Korea. Together with Hongnyeonam Hermitage, it is designated as the Scenic Site No. 27 of Korea under the name “Uisangdae Pavilion and Hongnyeonam Hermitage of Naksansa Temple, Yangyang.” Uisangdae is named after Uisang, a respected Silla-era Buddhist monk who is said to have founded this temple in 671 (11th year of King Munmu’s reign of Silla), and many stories of his deeds can still be found in the temple. For instance, Uisangdae is said to be the site where he meditated before founding Naksansa Temple at its present site. Today’s pavilion was restored to its present hexagonal form in 1995.","regDate":"2022-10-16","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-16-1665910327005/2711338_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-16-1665910327005"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
