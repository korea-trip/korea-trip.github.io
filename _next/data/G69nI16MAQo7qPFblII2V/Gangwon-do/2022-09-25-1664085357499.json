Located on the eastern outskirts of downtown Chuncheon, Gubongsan Mountain (441 m) with nine peaks, commands a panoramic view of the city. When the road passing halfway up the mountain was opened in the 1990s, many cafes and restaurants were established and became Chuncheon’s representative cafe street. All the cafes here have glass windows or outdoor terraces in order to offer the best scenic view for customers. Each cafe has its own characteristic feature  a building that recalls Santorini in Greece, the skywalk observatory decorated with transparent glass in all directions, and distinctive photo zones. The service area, which sells canned coffee and banquet noodles, is also situated among stylish coffee shops. Visitors will enjoy its fantastic scenic views from day to night, including the sunny scenery, the beautiful sunset, and the nighttime view of the Soyang i(2)gyo Bridge.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-33-250-4312|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|Open year round|\n|usetime:|00:00–24:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Observatory service area, cafe, and restaurant|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Free of charge|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-09-25-1664085357499/1804421_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664085357499/1804421_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664085357499/1804423_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664085357499/1804423_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664085357499/1804426_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664085357499/1804426_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664085357499/1804494_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664085357499/1804494_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664085357499/1988569_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664085357499/1988569_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664085357499/1988571_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664085357499/1988571_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664085357499/1988572_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664085357499/1988572_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664085357499/2622268_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664085357499/2622268_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664085357499/2622269_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664085357499/2622269_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664085357499/1804483_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664085357499/1804483_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-33-250-4312](tel:+82332504312)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.8928170392\nlongitude: 127.7766999636\ntitle: 1154-113, Sunhwan-daero, Dong-myeon, Chuncheon-si, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway + Taxi]<br>\nNamchuncheon Station (Seoul Subway Gyeongchun Line).<br>\nFrom the station, take a taxi for approx. 20 min.\n","data":{"id":"2022-09-25-1664085357499","title":"Gubongsan Observatory Cafe Street (구봉산 전망대 카페거리)","description":"Gubongsan Observatory Cafe Street is a well-known scenic spot for its beautiful landscape of Chuncheon with the background of mountains, lake, and river.

The peak is made of strange rocks stretching from the foot of the mountain to the top at 900 m above sea level. The peak consists of six rocks, which create a majestic view of the rocky peak. The peak with the circumference of 4 km forms a great panoramic view along with Daecheongbong Peak and Outer Seorak. Ulsan Peak presents an imposing scene, and it was visited by many famous poets and calligraphers including Choe Yeon and Heo Jeok during the Joseon period who left behind their records. In addition, several legends are associated with Ulsan Peak. One day, a heavenly god commanded peaks of all mountains to assemble at Geumgangsan Mountain to create the greatest scenery. However, the Ulsan Peak was too heavy, so it was late for the meeting. Feeling ashamed, it didn’t go back home (Ulsan) directly, and took a rest at Seoraksan Mountain, but stayed there forever. Also, there is a saying that the peak was named after the shape of the rock, which resembles a fence (ul+tari) or a crying (ul) mountain (san). Visitors can get to the Ulsan Peak by starting from the small park and passing through Sinheungsa Temple and Heundeul Rock. At the beginning of the path, it starts with a gentle slope, but after the Heundeul Rock, there are a steep rocky hill and the iron stairs. It requires about 4 hr for getting to and from the peak. It is hard for the elderly or children to climb because of high level of difficulty.","regDate":"2022-10-16","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Resources","Rocks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-16-1665913620696/2711195_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-16-1665913620696"},{"id":"2022-10-16-1665910327005","title":"Uisangdae Pavilion (낙산사 의상대)","description":"This pavilion is located on a seaside cliff on the way from Yangyang’s Naksansa Temple to Gwaneumgul Cave of Hongnyeonam Hermitage. The word “dae” in Uisangdae refers to a building built at a vantage point for areas with beautiful scenery. Indeed, the view of the East Sea and the coast from Uisangdae Pavilion awarded its recognition as one of the Eight Sights of Yangyang, and a must-visit place for all visitors to Naksansa Temple. Jeong Cheol (pen-name  Songgang), a famed scholar and writer of the poem Song of Diamond Mountains, chose the pavilion as one of the Eight Sights of Gwandong, and the pavilion is today one of the popular sites for sunrise-viewing on the east coast of Korea. Together with Hongnyeonam Hermitage, it is designated as the Scenic Site No. 27 of Korea under the name “Uisangdae Pavilion and Hongnyeonam Hermitage of Naksansa Temple, Yangyang.” Uisangdae is named after Uisang, a respected Silla-era Buddhist monk who is said to have founded this temple in 671 (11th year of King Munmu’s reign of Silla), and many stories of his deeds can still be found in the temple. For instance, Uisangdae is said to be the site where he meditated before founding Naksansa Temple at its present site. Today’s pavilion was restored to its present hexagonal form in 1995.","regDate":"2022-10-16","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-16-1665910327005/2711338_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-16-1665910327005"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
