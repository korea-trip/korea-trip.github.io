The waters of Mureunggyegok Valley flow over wide sheets of rock and into the cracks between them, forming large and particularly nice ponds along the path. Starting at Mureung Rock, a wide sheet of single rock on which hundreds can sit, the valley trail twists and turns as it passes Samhwasa Temple, Haksodae, Ongnyudong, and Seonnyeotang Ravine, all the way to Ssangpokpo and Yongchupokpo Falls, providing breathtaking scenery along the way. Also known as Arcadia, scholars and poets frequented the valley in times past, and the 5,000 square meters of Mureung Rock bears the inscribed names of some of these poets and their work. The valley offers a medley of curious-looking rocks and stones, and other odd scenery that attracts many tourists.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Korea Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-33-539-3700|\n|parking:|Available|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00 <br>* July-August 06:00-20:00<br>* November-February 08:00-17:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Hiking Course:|[Course 1] Management Office ‚Üí Samhwasa Temple ‚Üí Haksodae ‚Üí Gwaneumpokpo Falls ‚Üí Ongnyudong (25min one-way)<br />[Course 2] Management Office ‚Üí Ongnyudong ‚Üí Seonnyeotang Ravine ‚Üí Ssangpokpo Falls, Yongchupokpo Falls (40min one-way)<br />[Course 3] Management Office ‚Üí Ongnyudong ‚Üí Dutasanseong Fortress Entrance ‚Üí Dutasanseong Fortress (50min one-way)<br />[Course 4] Management Office ‚Üí Samhwasa Temple ‚Üí Gwaneumam Hermitage Entrance ‚Üí Gwaneumam Hermitage (50min one-way)|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Small vehicles 2,000 won / Large vehicles 5,000 won|\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals: Adults 2,000 won / Teenagers 1,500 won / Children 700 won<br>Groups: Adults 1,500 won / Teenagers 1,000 won / Children 500 won<br /><br>* Group: 30 people or more<br>* Free admission: Senior citizens (ages 65 and older), Preschoolers (ages 6 and under)|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-10-06-1665033039678/2613064_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665033039678/2613064_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-06-1665033039678/2613067_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665033039678/2613067_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-06-1665033039678/2660877_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665033039678/2660877_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-06-1665033039678/2660878_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665033039678/2660878_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-06-1665033039678/2660879_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665033039678/2660879_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-33-539-3700](tel:+82335393700)\n- [üè†www.dhsisul.org](http://www.dhsisul.org/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.4640430993\nlongitude: 129.0158009877\ntitle: 538, Samhwa-ro, Donghae-si, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Dong Seoul Bus Terminal, take a bus to Donghae Bus Terminal.<br>From Donghae Bus Terminal, take a local bus bound for Mureunggyegok Valley.\n","data":{"id":"2022-10-06-1665033039678","title":"Mureunggyegok Valley (Î¨¥Î¶âÍ≥ÑÍ≥°)","description":"Mureunggyegok Valley, between Dutasan Mountain and Cheongoksan Mountain, refers to a four-kilometer stretch from Hoamso Pond to Yongchupokpo Falls upstream.

The peak is made of strange rocks stretching from the foot of the mountain to the top at 900 m above sea level. The peak consists of six rocks, which create a majestic view of the rocky peak. The peak with the circumference of 4 km forms a great panoramic view along with Daecheongbong Peak and Outer Seorak. Ulsan Peak presents an imposing scene, and it was visited by many famous poets and calligraphers including Choe Yeon and Heo Jeok during the Joseon period who left behind their records. In addition, several legends are associated with Ulsan Peak. One day, a heavenly god commanded peaks of all mountains to assemble at Geumgangsan Mountain to create the greatest scenery. However, the Ulsan Peak was too heavy, so it was late for the meeting. Feeling ashamed, it didn‚Äôt go back home (Ulsan) directly, and took a rest at Seoraksan Mountain, but stayed there forever. Also, there is a saying that the peak was named after the shape of the rock, which resembles a fence (ul+tari) or a crying (ul) mountain (san). Visitors can get to the Ulsan Peak by starting from the small park and passing through Sinheungsa Temple and Heundeul Rock. At the beginning of the path, it starts with a gentle slope, but after the Heundeul Rock, there are a steep rocky hill and the iron stairs. It requires about 4 hr for getting to and from the peak. It is hard for the elderly or children to climb because of high level of difficulty.","regDate":"2022-10-16","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Resources","Rocks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-16-1665913620696/2711195_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-16-1665913620696"},{"id":"2022-10-16-1665910327005","title":"Uisangdae Pavilion (ÎÇôÏÇ∞ÏÇ¨ ÏùòÏÉÅÎåÄ)","description":"This pavilion is located on a seaside cliff on the way from Yangyang‚Äôs Naksansa Temple to Gwaneumgul Cave of Hongnyeonam Hermitage. The word ‚Äúdae‚Äù in Uisangdae refers to a building built at a vantage point for areas with beautiful scenery. Indeed, the view of the East Sea and the coast from Uisangdae Pavilion awarded its recognition as one of the Eight Sights of Yangyang, and a must-visit place for all visitors to Naksansa Temple. Jeong Cheol (pen-name  Songgang), a famed scholar and writer of the poem Song of Diamond Mountains, chose the pavilion as one of the Eight Sights of Gwandong, and the pavilion is today one of the popular sites for sunrise-viewing on the east coast of Korea. Together with Hongnyeonam Hermitage, it is designated as the Scenic Site No. 27 of Korea under the name ‚ÄúUisangdae Pavilion and Hongnyeonam Hermitage of Naksansa Temple, Yangyang.‚Äù Uisangdae is named after Uisang, a respected Silla-era Buddhist monk who is said to have founded this temple in 671 (11th year of King Munmu‚Äôs reign of Silla), and many stories of his deeds can still be found in the temple. For instance, Uisangdae is said to be the site where he meditated before founding Naksansa Temple at its present site. Today‚Äôs pavilion was restored to its present hexagonal form in 1995.","regDate":"2022-10-16","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-16-1665910327005/2711338_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-16-1665910327005"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
