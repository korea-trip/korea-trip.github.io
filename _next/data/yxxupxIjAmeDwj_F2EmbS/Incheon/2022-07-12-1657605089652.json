The street became connected samchi, or grilled seerfish, over 40 years ago with the opening House of Inha, a home-style restaurant. Originally, the street was not known for samchi, but it became one of the most popular menus at the restuarant, with many other shops in the area following in this trend. In 2002, it was designated as the grilled seerfish street and a signboard was put up at the street entrance. Currently, there are about a dozen grilled seerfish restaurants lining the street, and each restaurant has a unique signboard of its own. The fish are imported from New Zealand, and each restaurant offers a distinct taste resulting from different grilling methods and sauces. The restaurants also sell a variety of appetizers and side dishes at affordable prices.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|expagerange:|Open to visitors of all ages|\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-32-832-3031|\n|restdate:|Varies by shop|\n|usetime:|Varies by shop|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-12-1657605089652/728363_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-12-1657605089652/728363_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-12-1657605089652/728365_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-12-1657605089652/728365_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-12-1657605089652/728366_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-12-1657605089652/728366_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-32-832-3031](tel:+82328323031)\n- [üè†itour.incheon.go.kr</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.icjg.go.kr/tour/cttu0207a01\" target=\"_blank\">www.icjg.go.kr](http://itour.incheon.go.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.4757224674\nlongitude: 126.6286721359\ntitle: 57, Uhyeon-ro 67beon-gil, Jung-gu, Incheon\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway]<br>\nDongincheon Station (Seoul \nSubway Line 1), Exit 2. <br>\nTurn right, then immediately  turn left, and then go straight for about 150 m. <br>\nTurn right at the corner onto Uhyeonno 67beon-gil. <br>\n<br>\n[Bus] <br>\nDongincheon Station Bus Stop<Br>\n- Local Bus: 2, 3, 4, 6, 6-1, 10, 11, 15, 16, 17-1, 21, 21-1, 22, 23, 24, 27, 28, 41, 42, 45, 46, or 62 <br>  \n- Express bus: 105, 112, or 306\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-12-1657605089652","title":"Dongincheon Samchi Street (ÎèôÏù∏Ï≤ú ÏÇºÏπòÍ±∞Î¶¨)","description":"Dongincheon Samchi Street is located in front of Dongincheon Station in an alley to the side of Incheon Educational and Cultural Center for Students.

The previous salt storage has been converted into an ecology exhibition space, displaying the history of the area as well as the plants and animals that live here.

Many people visit in fall for the shimmering silver grass, said to appear in many colors depending on the lighting. The park amenities, including rest areas and benches, make the park a popular destination for families and couples.","regDate":"2022-08-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Nature","Natural Sites","Eco-Tourism Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-12-1660304118232/2675544_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-08-12-1660304118232"},{"id":"2022-08-12-1660301036287","title":"Songwol-dong Fairy Tale Village (ÏÜ°ÏõîÎèô ÎèôÌôîÎßàÏùÑ)","description":"Songwol-dong was named for its view of the moon between the pine forest.
