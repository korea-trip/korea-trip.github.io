The island is mostly covered in trees and lacks manmade facilities. As a result, the island still has most of its natural environment, a gift of nature. In summer, the area around Gaemeori Hill is a popular camping site because of its beautiful view of the Milky Way at night.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-32-899-3710|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-11-1660193458113/2661885_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660193458113/2661885_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660193458113/2661886_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660193458113/2661886_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660193458113/2661887_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660193458113/2661887_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-32-899-3710](tel:+82328993710)\n- [🏠www.ongjin.go.kr](https://www.ongjin.go.kr/open_content/tour/information/island_guleop.jsp?cate1=deokjeok&cate2=09)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.1973520849\nlongitude: 125.9908073720\ntitle: Gureop-ri, Ongjin-gun, Incheon\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-11-1660193458113","title":"Gureopdo Island (굴업도)","description":"Gureopdo Island is considered the Galapagos of Korea.

The previous salt storage has been converted into an ecology exhibition space, displaying the history of the area as well as the plants and animals that live here. The park expanded in April 2001 with the addition of the Ecology Hall and Nature Learning Center, offering various educational experience opportunities.
