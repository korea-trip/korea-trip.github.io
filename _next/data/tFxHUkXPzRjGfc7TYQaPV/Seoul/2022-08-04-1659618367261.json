It was extremely difficult for outsiders to visit the academy until 1997, when a special tourism course was created. The course showcases the major sites at Korea Military Academy. Starting from the school information center, visitors can see the museum, memorial hall, and exhibition center in a 1.5 hour course. The Military Museum displays treasures and materials from each branch of the military, while visitors can see the history of the military and lifestyle of cadets at the memorial hall. However, the highlight of a trip to Korea Military Academy is watching the Hwarang Ceremony, a parade of cadets which takes place every Saturday at 11 30. In the ceremony, cadets don their formal uniform to march. Touring the academy at 10 is perfect for watching the parade later.","regDate":"2022-08-05","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-05-1659673444508/1985643_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-08-05-1659673444508"},{"id":"2022-08-05-1659667423924","title":"King Sejong Statue (ÏÑ∏Ï¢ÖÎåÄÏôï ÎèôÏÉÅ)","description":"The King Sejong Statue was erected at the center of Gwanghawmun Square, in front of Gyeongbokgung Palace.

You can put your money in the bank for your next visit or purchase goods at the department store. In order to make the environment as realistic as possible, every building, car, and tree is reduced to 2/3 its real size, helping children feel more adult-like in their new world!
