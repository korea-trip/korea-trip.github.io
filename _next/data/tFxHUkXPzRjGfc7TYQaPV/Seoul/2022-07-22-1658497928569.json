It was extremely difficult for outsiders to visit the academy until 1997, when a special tourism course was created. The course showcases the major sites at Korea Military Academy. Starting from the school information center, visitors can see the museum, memorial hall, and exhibition center in a 1.5 hour course. The Military Museum displays treasures and materials from each branch of the military, while visitors can see the history of the military and lifestyle of cadets at the memorial hall. However, the highlight of a trip to Korea Military Academy is watching the Hwarang Ceremony, a parade of cadets which takes place every Saturday at 11 30. In the ceremony, cadets don their formal uniform to march. Touring the academy at 10 is perfect for watching the parade later.","regDate":"2022-08-05","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-05-1659673444508/1985643_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-08-05-1659673444508"},{"id":"2022-08-05-1659667423924","title":"King Sejong Statue (ÏÑ∏Ï¢ÖÎåÄÏôï ÎèôÏÉÅ)","description":"The King Sejong Statue was erected at the center of Gwanghawmun Square, in front of Gyeongbokgung Palace.

The theme park provides children with a chance to experience jobs that they might want to have when they grow up! Job experiences include working as a policeman, flight attendant, firefighter, or chef (uniforms are provided). When you work hard in Kidzania, you get paid in Kidzo (a virtual currency). You can put your money in the bank for your next visit or purchase goods at the department store. In order to make the environment as realistic as possible, every building, car, and tree is reduced to 2/3 its real size, helping children feel more adult-like in their new world! Kidzania mimics a real city environment, has diverse jobs, and is full of events. When there is a fire, a fireman rushes to help, and a news reporter covers the story. While 911 paramedics give first aid to fire victims, in another part of ‚Äútown‚Äù delivery personnel are dropping off packages. Kidzania teaches the next generation how to live as responsible members of society and gives them an introduction to how the economy works.","regDate":"2022-08-04","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Experience Programs","Unique Experience"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-04-1659656133025/2031380_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-08-04-1659656133025"},{"id":"2022-08-04-1659652608116","title":"KT Square (KTÏä§ÌÄòÏñ¥)","description":"KT Square is a multi-complex that offers various cultural performances as well as hands-on experiences of the latest in IT technology.
