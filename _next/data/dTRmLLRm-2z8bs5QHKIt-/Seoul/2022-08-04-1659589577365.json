Iljasan Mountain is one of the best spots in Seoul to watch the sunrise. Located on the mountain is the house of Master Lee Jip (pen-name Dunchon), providing a good getaway spot for local residents. Lee Jip was a loyal government official during the reign of King Gongmin during the late Goryeo dynasty. He was forced to move to an underground tunnel in the southwest side of Iljasan Mountain to avoid entrapment by Shin Don, a person of influence at the time. While living in hiding, he took the pen-name Dunchon (meaning drawing back to the countryside) to symbolize the hardships he was going through. The nearby area was named after him, being called Dunchon-dong.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-2-3425-6443|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Available Facilities:|Indoor and outdoor badminton venue, gymnasium, X-game hall, plaza, parking lot, Chohwaryu Hall, ecological pond, etc.|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659478_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659478_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659479_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659479_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659480_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659480_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659481_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659481_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659482_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659482_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659485_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659485_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659487_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659487_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659490_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659490_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659492_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659492_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659486_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659486_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n\n- [üè†parks.seoul.go.kr](http://parks.seoul.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5327334966\nlongitude: 127.1508007360\ntitle: 660, Dongnam-ro, Gangdong-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\n- Take Blue Bus No. 361 and get off at Bohun Hospital. <Br>\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-04-1659589577365","title":"Iljasan Mountain Natural Park (ÏùºÏûêÏÇ∞ÏûêÏó∞Í≥µÏõê)","description":"Iljasan Mountain is the tallest peak in Gangdong-gu, Seoul, providing the western boundary between Gangdong-gu and Hanam-si, Gyeonggi-do.
