Yeongsil Trail is known as the best autumn foliage course on Hallasan Mountain. Yeongsil Course is 3.7 kilometers and takes approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes. It starts from Yeongsil Rest Area and follows a relatively gentle slope lined with beautiful trees and autumn foliage for about one kilometer.<br> After that, an uphill path emerges along steep mountain ridges. The deep Yeongsilgyegok Valley and vast rock walls could be the result of a large volcano entrance in the past. After passing Byeongpungbawi Rock, the path becomes relatively flat until Witsaeoruem Rest Area. The first attraction of Yeongsil is a group of volcanic rocks collectively called Yeongsilgiam. These oddly shaped rocks are situated to the right of a big valley at 1,400 meters to 1,600 meters above sea level, soaring upwards towards the sky. Pass by Sajebi Hill to get a glass of mineral spring water, and  reach Eorimok to take the path downwards.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-64-713-9950~1,<br>+82-64-747-9950|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|[Ascent]<br> November-February 06:00-12:00 <br>March-April & September-October 05:30-14:30 <br>May-August 05:00-15:00<br>[Descent]<br>Witsaeoreum Volcanic Cone: November-February 15:00 / March-April & September-October 16:00 / May-August 17:00<br>Dongneung Peak: November-February 13:30 / March-April & September-October 14:00 / May-August 14:30<br>Nambyeok divide: November-February 14:00 / Spring, Fall 14:30 / May-August 15:00<br>* Hiking strictly limited to designated trail|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Available Facilities:|Trail information center, mountain museum, convenience store, etc. |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-02-14-1676364076313/2617905_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-14-1676364076313/2617905_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-14-1676364076313/2617906_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-14-1676364076313/2617906_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-14-1676364076313/2617907_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-14-1676364076313/2617907_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-14-1676364076313/2617908_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-14-1676364076313/2617908_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-64-713-9950](tel:+82647139950)\n- [🏠www.jeju.go.kr/hallasan</a> <br><a href=\"https://visitjeju.net/kr/#\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"새창 : 비짓제주 홈페이지로 이동\">visitjeju.net](https://www.jeju.go.kr/hallasan/index.htm)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.3402306397\nlongitude: 126.4803110551\ntitle: 246, Yeongsil-ro, Seogwipo-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2023-02-14-1676364076313","title":"Yeongsil Trail (Hallasan National Park) (한라산 영실)","description":"Hallasan Mountain has five trails excluding Donnaeko Course that is closed for nature preservation.
