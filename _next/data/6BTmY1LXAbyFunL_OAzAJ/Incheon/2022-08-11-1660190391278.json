Legend has it that in the year 416 (during the reign of King Jangsu of Goguryeo), a Buddhist monk named Cheonchukguk climbed Goryeosan Mountain and found Oryeonji Pond where the five-colored lotus flowers bloomed. The monk picked the lotus flower petals and blew them into the air. He then built a temple where each of the petals had landed, naming the temples according to their corresponding color: Jeokseoksa Temple, formerly Jeokryeonsa Temple (red lotus), Baengnyeonsa Temple (white lotus), Cheongryeonsa Temple (blue lotus), Hwangryeonsa Temple (yellow lotus), and Heungnyeonsa Temple (black lotus). \n<br><br>\nAround 130 dolmens are distributed along the foot of Goryeosan Mountain. Sirumisan Mountain, on the northern side of Goryeosan Mountain is said to have been the birthplace of General Yeongaesomun of the Goguryeo Kingdom.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-32-930-3515|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Hiking Course:|[Course 1] Baengnyeonsa Temple - Azalea field (3.7 km / Approx. 1 hr 20 min) <br /><br />[Course 2] Cheongnyeonsa Temple- Azalea field (2.9 km / Approx. 1 hr) <br /><br />[Course 3] Gobigogae Pass - Azalea field (2.4 km / Approx. 1 hr) <br /><br />[Course 4] Jeokseoksa Temple - Azalea field (5.2 km / Approx. 1 hr 50 min)<br /><br />[Course 5] Mikkujigogae Pass - Azalea field (5.8 km / Approx. 2 hr)|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2376706_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2376706_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2376708_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2376708_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2648946_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2648946_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2648947_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2648947_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2648948_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2648948_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2648949_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2648949_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2648950_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2648950_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2648951_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2648951_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2648952_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2648952_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2376705_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660190391278/2376705_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-32-930-3515](tel:+82329303515)\n- [üè†www.ganghwa.go.kr](http://www.ganghwa.go.kr/open_content/tour)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.7407298666\nlongitude: 126.4352713405\ntitle: Gocheon-ri, Ganghwa-gun, Incheon\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus + Subway]<BR>\nSinchon Station (Seoul Subway Line 2), Exit 4.<br>Go straight 260m to arrive at the bus stop in front of Artreon.<br>From the bus stop, take Bus 3000 to Ganghwa Bus Terminal. <BR>From Ganghwa Bus Terminal, take Bus No. 1, 23, 25, 27, 30, 32 or 35 and get off at Dolmen Square Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-11-1660190391278","title":"Goryeosan Mountain (Í≥†Î†§ÏÇ∞)","description":"Goryeosan Mountain, once referred to as Oryeonsan, is a mountain rich in folklore.
