It is said to have been built to appease the spirit of a young woman named Arang, who met an unfortunate death. <br><br>According to the legend, Arang was mistakenly killed by a low-ranking officer who had loved her and tried to hug her. After her death, she becomes a ghost and appears to every district magistrate (highest-ranking officer in a region) to appeal for the investigation of her unfair death, but each district magistrate dies of a heart attack. <br><br>Then, a new district magistrate by the name Lee is dispatched to the area. Unlike his predecessors, Lee listens to the story of the ghost and finds the low-ranked officer who had killed her and punishes him. He found Arang’s body and holded a religious ceremony on her behalf. Aranggak was also built in her memory. <br><br>Every year, an event called Arangje is held on April 16 by the lunar calendar in Aranggak Pavilion. Young maidens dressed in white hanbok perform a religious ceremony to soothe the sorrow of Arang. There is also a saying that the spirit of Arang will preserve the love of those couples who visit the pavilion together.","regDate":"2022-07-30","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-30-1659154895976/574085_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-07-30-1659154895976","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-07-30-1659154895976"},{"id":"2022-07-30-1659149972284","title":"Anmingogae Hill (안민고개)","description":"Anmingogae Hill is a 9-kilometer-long hill that stretches from Taebaek-dong in Jinhae to Anmin-dong in Changwon.
