Although the main temple hall may seem like an ordinary building with its tile roof and walls, the ceiling and the walls are all part of a cave. Some caves are very small, large enough to allow only one person to sit in, while some are spacious enough to provide room for three to four people. From statues of young monks to old and wise monks, a variety of rock-carved sculptures can be seen placed throughout the caves. The caves are connected by steep stairs carved into the cliff, leading all the way to the top. The Buddha statue situated at the top of the cliff is designated as Treasure No. 581 and is 4 meters in x_height and 2.2 meters in x_width. Unfortunately, this granite statue has gone through deterioration over time and a glass roof is built over the statue to prevent further damage. Golgulsa Temple offers training programs as well as a Templestay program for both domestic travelers and tourists from abroad.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-54-744-1689|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Seonmudo & Traditional cultural performance: 15:30 (Closed Mondays)|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-28-1669610583651/202517_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-28-1669610583651/202517_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-28-1669610583651/202522_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-28-1669610583651/202522_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-28-1669610583651/202527_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-28-1669610583651/202527_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-28-1669610583651/977061_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-28-1669610583651/977061_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-28-1669610583651/977079_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-28-1669610583651/977079_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-28-1669610583651/977091_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-28-1669610583651/977091_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-28-1669610583651/977109_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-28-1669610583651/977109_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-28-1669610583651/202509_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-28-1669610583651/202509_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-28-1669610583651/202525_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-28-1669610583651/202525_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-28-1669610583651/202533_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-28-1669610583651/202533_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-54-744-1689](tel:+82547441689)\n- [üè†www.golgulsa.com</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.templestay.com/temple_info.asp?t_id=d-kumkang \" target=\"_blank\">www.templestay.com](http://www.golgulsa.com/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.8057841422\nlongitude: 129.4091069500\ntitle: 101-5, Girim-ro, Gyeongju-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Taxi]<br>\nApprox. 30 min from Gyeongju Station\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-28-1669610583651","title":"Gyeongju Golgulsa Temple (Í≥®Íµ¥ÏÇ¨ (Í≤ΩÏ£º))","description":"Located at the foot of Hamwolsan Mountain, Golgulsa Temple houses twelve caves in a tall cliff, with a rock-carved statue of Buddha sitting at the highest point.
