The temple is widely believed to have been first built during the Tamra dynasty (BC 476~AD 1005), which was prior to the Goryeo dynasty (AD 918~1392). However, there is no concrete evidence suggesting the exact year of construction or the temple‚Äôs original builder. In the early 1700s, when leaders of the Joseon dynasty proclaimed Confucianism as the national religion and executed a policy to destroy all the Buddhist temples in the Jeju area, where Gwaneumsa Temple was demolished. It was rebuilt in 1912 by a Buddhist nun, Anbongryeokwan, and renovated in 1964. <br><br>\n\nThe temple consists of the main shrine, Myeongbujeong Hall, a bell tower, Sanshingak Pavilion, and Bulimun Gate. There is also a Buddhist school run by the Gwaneumsa Temple located in downtown Jeju.<br><br>\n\nThere are many tourist spots near the temple such as a wooden seated Buddhist goddess statue that was designated a tangible cultural asset of Jeju-do in 1999. Other popular destinations include Jeju Natural Monument No. 50, a cherry blossom tree habitat, and the nearby ‚Äú4.3 Historic Site‚Äù commemorating the civil revolution many years ago on April 3rd.<br><br>\n\nAlso located close to the temple are the Mokseokwan Arboretum, Sancheondan, Halla Mountain, Uerimok Valley, Tamra Valley, and Gewaloreum Hill. The steep trail leading up the side of Halla Mountain, ‚ÄúGwaneumsa Trail,‚Äù is particularly popular for its colorful fall foliage and its breathtaking scenery of endless gorges.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<BR> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-64-724-6830|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Hiking Course:|Gwaneumsa Temple campground -> Tamna Valley -> Gaemideung -> Samgakbong Peak -> Yongjingak -> Baengnokdam Crater Lake -> Peak<BR>* Distance: 9.3km <BR>* Hiking up 05:40 / Hiking down 04:00|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Not available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-20-1658302449746/1618289_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-20-1658302449746/1618289_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-20-1658302449746/1618290_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-20-1658302449746/1618290_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-20-1658302449746/1618291_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-20-1658302449746/1618291_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-20-1658302449746/1618293_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-20-1658302449746/1618293_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-20-1658302449746/1618294_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-20-1658302449746/1618294_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-20-1658302449746/1618297_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-20-1658302449746/1618297_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-20-1658302449746/219626_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-20-1658302449746/219626_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-20-1658302449746/531494_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-20-1658302449746/531494_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-20-1658302449746/596743_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-20-1658302449746/596743_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-20-1658302449746/596745_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-20-1658302449746/596745_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-64-724-6830](tel:+82647246830)\n- [üè†www.jejugwaneumsa.or.kr](http://www.jejugwaneumsa.or.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.4237615317\nlongitude: 126.5581440803\ntitle: 660, Sallokbuk-ro, Jeju-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>\nFrom Jeju-si, take the city bus towards Sancheondan. <BR> From Sancheondan, walk for approx. 30 min.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-20-1658302449746","title":"Gwaneumsa Temple (Jeju) (Í¥ÄÏùåÏÇ¨(Ï†úÏ£º))","description":"Gwaneumsa Temple is located at the foot of the northeast side of Hallasan Mountain.

Sanggoji is the on-site restaurant, and means rainbow in the local dialect. Carbon hot springs are known to have health benefits for the heart, as carbonic acid gas is absorbed in the skin, stimulating capillary vessels and expanding blood vessels.

The climate of Jeju is quite different from the temperate climate of mainland Korea. Since the island has a subtropical climate as well as a subarctic one, there are many peculiar plants that can only to be found on this island. The unique sight of Jeju Island captivates travelers. The scenery that represents this volcanic island of Jeju, such as Jusangjeolli Cliff (columnar joints on the coast) were created by Hallasan Mountain and Oreum (parasitic cones in Jeju dialect). The piedmont area that visitors encounter on their way from the beach to Hallasan Mountain is a gift of nature and the piedmont area on the way to Geomunoreum Volcanic Cone, where Jeju World Natural Heritage Center is located, is worth seeing. Another unique aspect here is the Jeju dialect and lifestyle.<br>Traveling the 182-kilometer circuit road along the coastline by car, motor scooter or bike is recommended. There is a trail for walking called ‚ÄúJeju Olle-gil‚Äù for those who choose to make a round trip on foot.
