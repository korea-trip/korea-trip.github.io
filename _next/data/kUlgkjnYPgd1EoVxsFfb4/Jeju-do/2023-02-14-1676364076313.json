Yeongsil Trail is known as the best autumn foliage course on Hallasan Mountain. Yeongsil Course is 3.7 kilometers and takes approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes. It starts from Yeongsil Rest Area and follows a relatively gentle slope lined with beautiful trees and autumn foliage for about one kilometer.<br> After that, an uphill path emerges along steep mountain ridges. The deep Yeongsilgyegok Valley and vast rock walls could be the result of a large volcano entrance in the past. After passing Byeongpungbawi Rock, the path becomes relatively flat until Witsaeoruem Rest Area. The first attraction of Yeongsil is a group of volcanic rocks collectively called Yeongsilgiam. These oddly shaped rocks are situated to the right of a big valley at 1,400 meters to 1,600 meters above sea level, soaring upwards towards the sky. Pass by Sajebi Hill to get a glass of mineral spring water, and  reach Eorimok to take the path downwards.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-64-713-9950~1,<br>+82-64-747-9950|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|[Ascent]<br> November-February 06:00-12:00 <br>March-April & September-October 05:30-14:30 <br>May-August 05:00-15:00<br>[Descent]<br>Witsaeoreum Volcanic Cone: November-February 15:00 / March-April & September-October 16:00 / May-August 17:00<br>Dongneung Peak: November-February 13:30 / March-April & September-October 14:00 / May-August 14:30<br>Nambyeok divide: November-February 14:00 / Spring, Fall 14:30 / May-August 15:00<br>* Hiking strictly limited to designated trail|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Available Facilities:|Trail information center, mountain museum, convenience store, etc. |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-02-14-1676364076313/2617905_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-14-1676364076313/2617905_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-14-1676364076313/2617906_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-14-1676364076313/2617906_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-14-1676364076313/2617907_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-14-1676364076313/2617907_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-14-1676364076313/2617908_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-14-1676364076313/2617908_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-64-713-9950](tel:+82647139950)\n- [üè†www.jeju.go.kr/hallasan</a> <br><a href=\"https://visitjeju.net/kr/#\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"ÏÉàÏ∞Ω : ÎπÑÏßìÏ†úÏ£º ÌôàÌéòÏù¥ÏßÄÎ°ú Ïù¥Îèô\">visitjeju.net](https://www.jeju.go.kr/hallasan/index.htm)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.3402306397\nlongitude: 126.4803110551\ntitle: 246, Yeongsil-ro, Seogwipo-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2023-02-14-1676364076313","title":"Yeongsil Trail (Hallasan National Park) (ÌïúÎùºÏÇ∞ ÏòÅÏã§)","description":"Hallasan Mountain has five trails excluding Donnaeko Course that is closed for nature preservation.

The maze not only offers a fun activity for you and your friends, but also provides health benefits as the stones emit high levels of far-infrared radiation and the woods (T. occidentalis) produce a large volume of phytoncides. The park, with its variety of trees several decades old, is the perfect place for forest bathing,‚Äù in which people surround themselves with nature (particularly trees) to soak in the natural benefits.<br><br>In addition to the mazes made of trees and stones, visitors are encouraged to check out the maze museum detailing the history of mazes starting from their origin in the 14th century.

In May 2004, it was designated a site for protection as a hot springs source (Jeju Notice No. 2004-12). The hot springs opened in 2005 with Gumyeongsu, a hot springs public bath, spanning 11,111 square meters, housed in a 3,300-square-meter building with an estimated 1,000-person capacity. Sanggoji is the on-site restaurant, and means rainbow in the local dialect. Carbon hot springs are known to have health benefits for the heart, as carbonic acid gas is absorbed in the skin, stimulating capillary vessels and expanding blood vessels. This enhances blood circulation, lowering blood pressure and reducing the burden on the heart.","regDate":"2023-02-17","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Hot Springs & Spa"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-17-1676612149553/1620176_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-17-1676612149553"},{"id":"2023-02-17-1676608827342","title":"Jeju Island Special Tourist Zone (Ï†úÏ£ºÎèÑ Í¥ÄÍ¥ëÌäπÍµ¨)","description":"Jeju Island, designated as Jeju Special Autonomous Province, lies southwest of the Korean Peninsula and is the largest tourist destination in Korea. The whole island was designated as a special tourist zone, and wherever tourists go, they can look upon beautiful scenery. Every year, about 8.7 million people from Korea and abroad visit this fascinating island that measures 73 kilometers across, east to west, and 31 kilometers, from north to south.<br>Jeju Island earned the UNESCO triple crown, being designated as a World Natural Heritage, Global Geopark, and Biosphere Reserve as well as one of the Seven Wonders of Nature. The climate of Jeju is quite different from the temperate climate of mainland Korea. Since the island has a subtropical climate as well as a subarctic one, there are many peculiar plants that can only to be found on this island. The unique sight of Jeju Island captivates travelers. The scenery that represents this volcanic island of Jeju, such as Jusangjeolli Cliff (columnar joints on the coast) were created by Hallasan Mountain and Oreum (parasitic cones in Jeju dialect). The piedmont area that visitors encounter on their way from the beach to Hallasan Mountain is a gift of nature and the piedmont area on the way to Geomunoreum Volcanic Cone, where Jeju World Natural Heritage Center is located, is worth seeing. Another unique aspect here is the Jeju dialect and lifestyle.<br>Traveling the 182-kilometer circuit road along the coastline by car, motor scooter or bike is recommended. There is a trail for walking called ‚ÄúJeju Olle-gil‚Äù for those who choose to make a round trip on foot. Jeju Island is implementing more discretionary and diversified policies in politics and economy as well as tourism, and this is what makes Jeju worthy of the name ‚Äúfree international city.‚Äù","regDate":"2023-02-17","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Tourist Complexes"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-17-1676608827342/1620163_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-17-1676608827342"},{"id":"2023-02-17-1676605198655","title":"Jeju Glass Castle (Ï†úÏ£ºÏú†Î¶¨ÏùòÏÑ±)","description":"Visitors to Jeju Glass Castle will be entranced by its magical atmosphere.
