This temple enshrines a Seokjomireukbosalipsang Buddha (Treasure), which was built over the course of 38 years, beginning in 967 during the Goryeo period. According to legend, while a lady was picking fernbrake on Banyasan Mountain, she heard a baby crying. When she went&nbsp;over, there was no baby but instead was a large rock sticking out from the ground. Upon hearing this story, the government ordered a Buddha statue to be made from the rock. This Buddha statue, widely known as ‚ÄòEunjimireuk Buddha,‚Äô is the largest stone Buddha in Korea (18.12 meters in x_height, 9.9 meters in girth, 1.8 meters in the length of ears, 2.43 meters at the x_height of crown). There are many other cultural heritages in this temple and every April, a splendid cherry blossom tunnel stretching from Nonsan to Gwanchoksa Temple is at its peak.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-41-1330<BR> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-41-736-5700|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A Open all year round|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|[Individuals]<br> Adults 1,500 won / Teenagers 1,200 won / Children 800 won <br> <br> [Groups] <br> Adults 1,000 won / Teenagers 1,000 won / Children 700 won <br> <br> * Adults (ages 19 and older) / Teenages (middle & high school students) / Children (ages 7 to 12)<br> * Free admission for senior citizens (ages 65 and older) <br>* Groups: 30 or more people|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-11-1668152276608/1278837_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668152276608/1278837_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-11-1668152276608/1278845_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668152276608/1278845_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-11-1668152276608/1279014_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668152276608/1279014_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-11-1668152276608/1279034_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668152276608/1279034_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-11-1668152276608/1278772_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668152276608/1278772_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-11-1668152276608/1278778_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668152276608/1278778_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-11-1668152276608/1278780_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668152276608/1278780_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-11-1668152276608/1278785_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668152276608/1278785_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-11-1668152276608/1278808_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668152276608/1278808_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-11-1668152276608/1278827_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668152276608/1278827_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-41-736-5700](tel:+82417365700)\n- [üè†gwanchoksa.modoo.at](http://gwanchoksa.modoo.at/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.1888348777\nlongitude: 127.1136855228\ntitle: 25, Gwanchok-ro 1beon-gil, Nonsan-si, Chungcheongnam-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-11-1668152276608","title":"Nonsan Gwanchoksa Temple (Í¥ÄÏ¥âÏÇ¨(ÎÖºÏÇ∞))","description":"Gwanchoksa Temple in Nonsan, Chungcheongnam-do is located at the foot of&nbsp;Banyasan Mountain (100 meters in elevation).

There are few existing records that mention the temple‚Äôs beginning. Some suggest that it was built around AD 527 during the 5th year of Baekje King Seongwang‚Äôs reign, but there is little evidence to support this theory. The only reference alluding to a specific time is Yeojidoseo (Detailed Survey of Korean Geography published during the late Joseon dynasty). It states Jeongamsa Temples location as on Oseosan Mountain, and Oseosan Mountain being surrounded by Hongsan Mountain and Baegwolsan Mountain and intersected by Hongju, Gyeolseong, and Boryeong. This indicates the temple was recognized in the mid-18th century and around the same time, Garamgo (a book about temples, published in the late 18th century) also states that Jeongamsa Temple is located approximately 11 kilometers to the east of Gyeolseonghyeon. It is still uncertain whether the temple referred to is Jeongamsa Temple on Oseosan Mountain. <br>Some foundation stones within the temple site measure 70-80 centimeters on each side. These stones indicate that the old Buddhist shrine of Jeongamsa Temple was laid out with five <em>kan</em> (Korean unit of measurement indicating the space between two pilars) at the front and three kan on the side. Future archaeological studies will help identify the true history of Jeongamsa Temple.","regDate":"2022-11-20","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Chungcheongnam-do/2022-11-20-1668919580082"},{"id":"2022-11-20-1668916695189","title":"Gongseri Catholic Church (ÏïÑÏÇ∞ Í≥µÏÑ∏Î¶¨ÏÑ±Îãπ)","description":"Gongseri Catholic Church was founded in 1894 as the main parish of the Daejeon diocese in Gongse-ri, Inju-myeon that connects Asanman Bay to Sapgyocheon Stream.

This was the first Catholic church in Chungcheongnam-do and the religion spread across Anseong, Onyang, and Dunpo to establish regional churches respectively. The grounds have three graves of prosecuted martyrs, a parish and rectory, retreat house, and meeting room.
