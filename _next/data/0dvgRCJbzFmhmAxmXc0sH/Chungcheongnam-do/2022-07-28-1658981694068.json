There are few existing records that mention the temple‚Äôs beginning. Some suggest that it was built around AD 527 during the 5th year of Baekje King Seongwang‚Äôs reign, but there is little evidence to support this theory. The only reference alluding to a specific time is Yeojidoseo (Detailed Survey of Korean Geography published during the late Joseon dynasty). It states Jeongamsa Temples location as on Oseosan Mountain, and Oseosan Mountain being surrounded by Hongsan Mountain and Baegwolsan Mountain and intersected by Hongju, Gyeolseong, and Boryeong. This indicates the temple was recognized in the mid-18th century and around the same time, Garamgo (a book about temples, published in the late 18th century) also states that Jeongamsa Temple is located approximately 11 kilometers to the east of Gyeolseonghyeon. It is still uncertain whether the temple referred to is Jeongamsa Temple on Oseosan Mountain. <br>Some foundation stones within the temple site measure 70-80 centimeters on each side. These stones indicate that the old Buddhist shrine of Jeongamsa Temple was laid out with five <em>kan</em> (Korean unit of measurement indicating the space between two pilars) at the front and three kan on the side. Future archaeological studies will help identify the true history of Jeongamsa Temple.","regDate":"2022-11-20","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Chungcheongnam-do/2022-11-20-1668919580082"},{"id":"2022-11-20-1668916695189","title":"Gongseri Catholic Church (ÏïÑÏÇ∞ Í≥µÏÑ∏Î¶¨ÏÑ±Îãπ)","description":"Gongseri Catholic Church was founded in 1894 as the main parish of the Daejeon diocese in Gongse-ri, Inju-myeon that connects Asanman Bay to Sapgyocheon Stream. Early missionaries originally used a common house for church meetings in the early years until in 1897 when a rectory was built, followed by the establishment of the main church in 1922. This was the first Catholic church in Chungcheongnam-do and the religion spread across Anseong, Onyang, and Dunpo to establish regional churches respectively. The grounds have three graves of prosecuted martyrs, a parish and rectory, retreat house, and meeting room. The premises is surrounded by beautiful views of a lush forest.","regDate":"2022-11-20","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Holy Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-20-1668916695189/2439706_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Chungcheongnam-do/2022-11-20-1668916695189"},{"id":"2022-11-19-1668854405248","title":"Ganggyeong Bugok Methodist Church (Íµ¨ Í∞ïÍ≤ΩÏÑ±Í≤∞ÍµêÌöå ÏòàÎ∞∞Îãπ)","description":"The early form of church architecture was mostly hanok (Korean traditional houses) style as it was the time when missionary activities were just settling.
