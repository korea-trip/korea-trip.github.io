{"pageProps":{"content":"![Seosan Palbongsan Mountain (팔봉산(서산))](/2022-11-14-1668404666423/1919432_image2_1.webp)\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> Palbongsan Mountain stretches out like a folding screen and stands high with great spirit. It is known that the mountain was named Palbong (“eight peaks” in Korean) because of its eight peaks standing in a row. There are actually nine peaks, but the smallest was not included. Legend says the smallest weeps over its exclusion at the end of every December. The third peak is the highest, standing at 362 meters with a beautiful view and crisp air, making it ideal for hiking (3-hour course) and resting at the top. There is another mountain of the same name in Hongcheon, so this mountain is usually referred to as “Seosan Palbongsan.”\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <BR>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-41-662-2004|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Hiking Course:|Seosan Terminal - Yanggil Parking lot - water fountain - Nojeokbong Peak - Site of Unamsa Temple / cloud ladder - Site of Cheonje / heliport - Sangbong Peak - Jeotgarakbawi Rock - Sanigogae / Seotaesa - Daemundari Bridge |\n|Restricted Mountain Areas :|[Refer to the website.](http://hiking.kworks.co.kr/sub_map/map_user01.aspx)|\n|Mountain Not Access Period:|Seasonal Forest Fire Prevention Period<br>Spring: March 2 - April 30 <br>Autumn: November 1 - December 15<br>National Park: November 15 - December 15 (Excluding Gyeongju and Taean)<br>* Periods and areas are subject to change based on fire weather advisories, snow/precipitation levels, and other local conditions.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-14-1668404666423/1919424_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-14-1668404666423/1919424_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-14-1668404666423/1919425_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-14-1668404666423/1919425_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-14-1668404666423/1919427_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-14-1668404666423/1919427_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-14-1668404666423/1919428_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-14-1668404666423/1919428_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-14-1668404666423/1919429_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-14-1668404666423/1919429_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-14-1668404666423/1919431_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-14-1668404666423/1919431_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-14-1668404666423/1919433_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-14-1668404666423/1919433_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-41-662-2004](tel:+82416622004)\n- [🏠www.seosan.go.kr](http://www.seosan.go.kr/tour/index.do)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.8042375084\nlongitude: 126.3753578467\ntitle: Yanggil-ri, Seosan-si, Chungcheongnam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>\nFrom Seoul Nambu Terminal or Central City Terminal, take a Bus to Seosan Bus Terminal. <br>\n\nFrom Seosan Bus Terminal Bus Stop, take Bus No. 700 (Eosong, Yanggil, Deoksong, Gudo, Hori, Eosong) and get  off at Palbong Elementary School Bus Stop. <BR>Transfer to Bus No. 704 (Eosong, Gudo, Deoksong, Palbongsan Mountain, Yanggil, Gonam2) and get off at Palbongsan Mountain Bus Stop.<BR> Walk for approx. 720m.\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-14-1668404666423","title":"Seosan Palbongsan Mountain (팔봉산(서산))","description":"Palbongsan Mountain stretches out like a folding screen and stands high with great spirit.

Upon his arrival, he sighted a pair of golden crows flying above the boat and followed the birds before they disappeared. He found the birds at the temples current location, drinking from a puddle of water that had an aromatic smell. From then on the mountain was called Geumosan, meaning the mountain of golden crow, and the temple was named Hyangcheonsa, meaning the temple of fragrant water.","regDate":"2022-11-18","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-18-1668768128450/1962103_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Chungcheongnam-do/2022-11-18-1668768128450"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
