Gongneung is the royal tomb of Queen Jangsun (1445-1461), consort of King Yejong, the 8th ruler of the Joseon dynasty. She died when she was still a crown princess, so her tomb is very simple. There is not even a ‚ÄúMangjuseok,‚Äù which is the name for the pair of stones that stand on either side of the mound. <br><br>\nSulleung is the tomb of Queen Gonghye (1456-1474), a consort of King Seongjong, the 9th ruler of the Joseon dynasty. Sulleung is similar to Gongneung in many ways, but it has more stonework. Queen Gonghye was the 4th daughter of Han Myeong-Hoe, a high-ranking government officer, and a sister of Queen Jangsun, who is buried in Gongneung. This was the only time in the history of the Joseon dynasty that two sisters both became queen.<br><br>\nYeongneung is the tomb of the posthumously designated king, King Jinjong (1719-1728), the first son of King Yeongjo, and Queen Hyosun (1715-1751). King Jinjong became the crown prince at the age of 7, but he died when he was only 13 in Changgyeonggung Palace. Queen Hyosun became the crown princess when she was 13 years old. In 1751, she died at the age of 37 without an heir.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-31-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-31-941-4208|\n|parking:|Available (42 parking spaces, small vehicles 35, large vehicles 7)|\n|restdate:|Mondays|\n|usetime:|February-May, September-October 09:00-18:00 <br>June-August 09:00-18:30 <br>November-January 09:00-17:30 <br>* Last ticketing 1 hour before closing|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Rest area, drinking fountain, bicycle rack|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|[International visitors]<br>Individuals - Adults 1,000 won / Children 500 won<br>Groups - Adults 800 won / Children 400 won<br> <br> * Adults (ages 19-64) / Children (ages 7-18)<br>* Groups: 10 or more people <br>* Free admission: Preschoolers (ages 6 & younger), senior citizens (ages 65 & older) <br> <br> [Hourly / Lunch / Day Pass] <br> Hourly Pass : Valid for 1 year <br> Lunch: 12:00-13:00<br> - Fee: 30,000 won <br> Lunch Pass: Valid for 3 months (10 times) <br> - Entry : 12:00-14:00 (Admission Time: 12:00-13:00) <br> - Fee: 3,000 won <br> Day Pass: Valid for 1 month <br> - Entry : Anytime during the operating hours. <br> - Fee: 10,000 won|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Not available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-09-03-1662187589838/1593604_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-03-1662187589838/1593604_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-03-1662187589838/1593606_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-03-1662187589838/1593606_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-03-1662187589838/1593607_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-03-1662187589838/1593607_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-03-1662187589838/1593608_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-03-1662187589838/1593608_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-31-941-4208](tel:+82319414208)\n- [üè†royaltombs.cha.go.kr](http://royaltombs.cha.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.7471166613\nlongitude: 126.8288823384\ntitle: 89, Samneung-ro, Paju-si, Gyeonggi-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-09-03-1662187589838","title":"Paju Three Royal Tombs [UNESCO World Heritage] (ÌååÏ£º ÏÇºÎ¶â [Ïú†ÎÑ§Ïä§ÏΩî ÏÑ∏Í≥ÑÎ¨∏ÌôîÏú†ÏÇ∞])","description":"Paju Three Royal Tombs consists of the Gongneung, Sulleung, and Yeongneung tombs.

King Jangjo was the father of King Jeongjo, the 22nd ruler of the Joseon dynasty. <br><br> King Jangjo was the second son of King Yeongjo, the 21st ruler of the Joseon dynasty. He was installed as Crown Prince in 1736. As the Crown Prince, he administered the state affairs on behalf of his father and showed great capability in various fields. However, he died in 1762 after being locked in a wooden rice chest by the orders of his father, King Yeongjo. <br> <br> The tomb of this ill-fated Crown Prince was originally located on Baebongsan Mountain in Yangju-gun, Gyeonggi-do. His son King Jeongjo moved the tomb to  Hwasan Mountain in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi-do and changed the title of the tomb to Hyeollyungwon. Later, he posthumously gave his father the title King Jangjo and moved the tomb to its current place, and the title of the tomb was changed again to Yungneung.<br><br> Queen Heongyeong was designated as a crown princess in 1744. In 1795 when she turned 60 and long after her husband died, she wrote Hanjungnok, The Memoirs, which is mainly about the terrible fate of her husband.<br> The Memoirs have great historical significance, and these, along with the Tales of Queen Inhyeon, are highly valued as pieces of royal literature.<br><br>Yungneung is currently located in Annyeong-dong in Hwaseong. A stone called ‚ÄúByeongpungseok‚Äù surrounds the tomb. On the stone, peony and lotus flowers are engraved. Like other royal tombs, there are two separate spaces ‚Äì one raised and one lower space. In the raised space, there is the mound, ‚ÄúHonyuseok,‚Äù which is a rectangular shaped stone sitting in front of the mound, and Mangjuseok, which is a pair of stones that sit on both sides of the mound. In the lower spaces, there are several stone statues. They include ‚ÄúMuninseok,‚Äù a statue of a civil officer, ‚ÄúMuinseok,‚Äù a statue of a military officer, and ‚ÄúSeokma,‚Äù a statue of a horse. <br><br><br> Geolleung is the joint tomb of King Jeongjo (1752-1800), the 22nd ruler of the Joseon dynasty, and Queen Hyoui (1753-1821). <br><br> King Jeongjo‚Äôs last wish was to be buried near his father‚Äôs tomb in Yungneung. King Jeongjo was the second son of King Jangjo and Queen Heongyeong, but in 1759, when he was 8 years old, he was designated as the heir to the throne. During his 24 year-reign, King Jeongjo influenced state affairs by implementing the ‚ÄúTangpyeongchaek (a policy to balance the power of political factions),‚Äù and he also had great accomplishments in the area of academic research by creating the ‚ÄúGyujanggak (a national royal library).‚Äù <br><br> Queen Hyoui was a daughter of Kim Si Muk and was installed as a partner of the heir to the throne at the age of 10. In 1776, when King Jeongjo ascended the throne, she also became Queen. She is known to have led a frugal life. In 1821, she died without an heir at the age of 69 in Jagyeongjeon, Changgyeonggung Palace. <br><br> Geolleung looks very similar to Yungneung, but unlike Yungneung, it does not have a ‚ÄúByeongpungseok,‚Äù which is a wide and rectangular stone that surrounds the mound and protects it. Instead, it is surrounded by ‚ÄúNanganseok,‚Äù stone handrails. On every handrail, lotus flowers are engraved. King Jeongjo‚Äôs tomb is simpler and less decorated than his father‚Äôs, which reflects King Jeongjo‚Äôs respect and love for his father. Both Geolleung and Yungneung are designated as Historic Site No. 206.","regDate":"2022-09-21","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-09-21-1663736793928"},{"id":"2022-09-20-1663670813897","title":"Yongsopokpo Falls (Ïö©ÏÜåÌè≠Ìè¨)","description":"Three kilometers up Domachigyegok Valley from Sampalgyo Bridge, Yongsopokpo Falls flows peacefully into Yongso Pond.

This was the first joint royal tomb of the Joseon dynasty.<br><br> King Sejong was the third son of the third ruler, King Taejong, and his wife Queen Wongyeong. He came to the throne at the age of 22. During his 32-year reign, he was very influential in the development of Korean culture. For example, King Sejong created the Korean alphabet, which he called Hunminjeongeum, and set up the Hall of Worthies (Jiphyeonjeon), an association of the kingdom‚Äôs brightest scholars. He also used Confucian principles to administer state affairs. Under the reign of King Sejong, therefore, many sectors including politics, economy, society and culture flourished. In fact, King Sejong the Great is regarded as making some of the most brilliant achievements in Korean history. <br><br> Yeongneung is currently located in Neungseo-myeon in Yeoju-si in Gyeonggi-do, but the tomb was originally located in Seogang, Gwangju. When it was constructed following Queen Soheon‚Äôs death in 1446, it was decided it should be a joint tomb, and the space on the right side was reserved for King Sejong. In 1450 when King Sejong died, he was buried together with the dead queen. Later, the tomb was moved to its current place, as it was thought that the original location was not an auspicious place according to geomantic traditions.<br><br> Various items that were originally buried in the tomb were excavated in 1973 and now are exhibited in the King Sejong the Great Memorial Hall, which is located in Cheongnyangni, Seoul. <br><br> Nyeongneung is the royal tomb of the 17th ruler of the Joseon dynasty, King Hyojong (1619-1659, reign 1649-1659), and of his wife Queen Inseon (1618-1674).<br><br> The tomb was originally located to the west of Geonwolleung (the tomb of King Taejo, the first ruler of the Joseon dynasty), but in 1673 cracks appeared on the tomb‚Äôs ‚ÄúByeongpungseok‚Äù (stone border), and it was moved to its current location, which is to the east of Yeongneung (the tomb of King Sejong).<br><br> King Hyojong was the second son of King Injo, Joseon dynasty‚Äôs 16th ruler, and Queen Illyeol. Upon ascending to the throne, he devised a plan to conquer the northern region of Asia, including the Qing dynasty (part of China). As part of the plan, he reformed the military system and strengthened the army and military enforcements. King Hyojong had spent time in northern China when he was taken hostage by the Manchus. During that time he became exposed to many different cultures and technological advancements. When a group of Dutch sailors were shipwrecked on the Korean shore, King Hyojong ordered them to build the Korean army‚Äôs first muskets. <br><br> King Hyojong also implemented ‚ÄúDaedongbeop,‚Äù a tax system under which people had to pay taxes with rice, and circulated ‚ÄúSangpyeongtongbo,‚Äù the coinage of the Joseon dynasty.","regDate":"2022-09-20","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-20-1663660086765/2482766_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-09-20-1663660086765"},{"id":"2022-09-20-1663655587484","title":"Yeoju Silleuksa Temple (Ïã†Î•µÏÇ¨ (Ïó¨Ï£º))","description":"Silleuksa Temple is located along the upper section of the Namhangang River as it flows from Bongmisan Mountain in Yeoju.
