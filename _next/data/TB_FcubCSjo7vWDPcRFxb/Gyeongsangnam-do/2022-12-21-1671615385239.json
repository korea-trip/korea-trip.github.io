It is also dotted with seven waterfalls and 33 ponds. The hike becomes more difficult as the trail enters the valley. Because the valley has taken many lives, some people call it The Valley of Death. For that reason, visitors must apply in advance and hike with a guide. The trail in Chilseon Valley is a 9.4-kilometer course from Chuseong Village in Macheon-myeon to Cheonwangbong Peak, which does not follow the natural valley, due to the valleys steep and dangerous features. Starting from Chuseong Village, the trail passes Yongso Pond, Jujiteo Site, Chuseongmang Rock, Seonnyeotang Pond, Ongnyeotang Pond, Biseondam, Chilseonpokpo Falls, Daeryukpokpo Falls, Samcheungpokpo Falls and Mapokpo Falls, all before reaching Cheonwangbong Peak.","regDate":"2022-12-21","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Valleys"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-21-1671600968838/2617002_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-21-1671600968838","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-21-1671600968838"},{"id":"2022-12-21-1671597571410","title":"Jinjuseong Fortress (ÏßÑÏ£ºÏÑ±)","description":"Jinjuseong Fortress, which is historically linked to the Imjin War (1592-1598), was originally named Geoyeolseong Fortress during the Three Kingdom Period, later renamed as Chokseokseong Fortress in the Goryeo dynasty and finally settled as Jinjuseong Fortress in the Joseon dynasty.
