The fortress was built in 1656 and the outpost was constructed in 1679. It was completely remodeled into \na masonry castle with gates in 1745. During Sinmiyangyo (the American invasion in 1871), Gwangseongbo was the fiercest battle ground in Ganghwa. On April 24, 1871, a \n fleet with 1,230 American naval forces led by Rear Admiral John Rodgers landed on Ganghwado Island to demand the \nopening of Korea's ports and commerce. The armed forces attacked Chojijin Fortress \nand Deokjinjin Camp, then marched to Gwangseongbo Fortress, where they engaged in close combat with the warriors of Joseon. Although General Eo Jae-yeon and the other warriors were poorly equipped with far inferior weapons, they bravely fought to the \ndeath against the invading forces. \n\n<br><br>The battlefield ruins of the fortress and the gate towers such as Anhaeru, Gwangseongdon, Sondolmokdon, and Yongdudon were repaired \nin 1977.  The twin tombs of General Eo Jae-Yeon and his brother Eo Jae-seon, along with the anonymous tombs of warriors who died on the battlefield were \nalso honorably arranged at the same time. Furthermore, a stone monument commemorating the restoration of Ganghwa Battlefield was erected on Yongdudondae Post. \n<br><br>In 1988, an extensive rest area was created toward the shore for visitors‚Äô convenience. Gwangseongbo Fortress is presently designated as Historical Relic No. 227.

Salted Baendaengi also makes an excellent side-dish for Korean meals. <br> <br>* Baendaengi is one of many types of small prey fish referred to as ‚ÄòSoeo‚Äô for their fierce struggle in fishing nets. Soeo have internal organs that are proportionally smaller than other species of fish and are known for their feisty nature.

During the Byeonginyangyo (the French invasion in 1866), the French fleet stayed in Ganghwado for about a month until they withdrew their forces after losing during the Jeongjoksanseong Battle. During the Sinmiyangyo (the United States expedition to Korea in 1981), the American fleet attacked Chojijin Fortress, Deokjinjin Fortress and Gwangseongbo Fortress. Hence, Ganghwado played a big part in South Korea opening its doors to the West in the 19th century. Ganghwado also became the Western Christian missionaries' center of activity for their missionary works.<br><br>There are three remaining churches that were built in that time that were  influenced or built by the Western Christian Missionaries  Ganghwa Anglican Church established in 1900, Ganghwa St. Andrew's Church established in 1906, and Ganghwa Seodo Central Church established in 1923. <br><br>Ganghwa Seodo Central Church started contruction in February 1923 and was completed as a Korean-architecture chapel in July 1923. The original name was Jumun Church and it was renamed as Seodo Central (Jungang) Church in 1978. The church belongs to The Korean Methodist Church.<br><br>Even though the building of the church doesn't reflect outstanding building techniques and aesthetic qualities, a Western church with a Korean-style wooden structure such as Ganghwa Seodo Central Church is still worth a visit.","regDate":"2022-08-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Holy Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-08-13-1660387217022"},{"id":"2022-08-13-1660368996299","title":"Ganghwa Gyodongdo Island (ÍµêÎèôÎèÑ(Í∞ïÌôî))","description":"Gyodongdo Island is located northwest of the larger Ganghwado Island, and was made more accessible with the opening of Gyodongdaegyo Bridge in July 2014.

The island served as an important stopover point for ambassadors and envoys heading to China. Popular attractions on the island now include Daeryong Market, an alleyway market decorated with colorful murals and statues, and Manghyangdae Memorial, a gathering place for refugees who fled from the nearby Hwanghaedo Island during the Korean War. Many of the houses on Gyodongdo Island have swallow nests under the eaves. The refugees consider the swallows as guests from their hometowns. As such, the island is home to the peace & reunion themed Gyodong Swallow House, Peace Trail, and Gyodong Studio. Gyodong Swallow House serves as an exhibition and performance space. The Peace Trail is a biking path around the island.
