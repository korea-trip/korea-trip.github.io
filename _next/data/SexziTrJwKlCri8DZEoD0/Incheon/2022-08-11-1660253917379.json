When the tide is low, visitors will be fascinated by the distinctive co-existence of endless black wetland and the ivory sandy beach. Pine trees surround the coast, giving it a distinctive charm as compared to other beaches. From Masian Beach, visitors can see Silmido Island, which was the location of the events portrayed in, as well as the filming location of the movie \"Silmido (2003),\" that drew such great interest and forced the history of Korean movies to be re-written. Near the coast, there are numerous <em>pojangmacha</em> (tented food stalls) offering grilled shellfish.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>• For more info: +82-32-760-8872|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Mudflat experience center|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-11-1660253917379/1577653_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660253917379/1577653_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660253917379/1577654_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660253917379/1577654_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660253917379/1577655_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660253917379/1577655_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660253917379/1577657_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660253917379/1577657_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660253917379/1577658_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660253917379/1577658_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660253917379/1579380_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660253917379/1579380_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660253917379/1579381_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660253917379/1579381_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660253917379/1579383_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660253917379/1579383_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-32-760-8872](tel:+82327608872)\n- [🏠masian-beach.co.kr](http://masian-beach.co.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.4296490966\nlongitude: 126.4162233568\ntitle: 118, Masiran-ro, Jung-gu, Incheon\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-11-1660253917379","title":"Masian Beach (용유도 마시안해변)","description":"Located in the vicinity of Incheon International Airport, Masian Beach is unique in that it offers visitors an opportunity to experience both wetland and a sandy beach at the same time.

Salted Baendaengi also makes an excellent side-dish for Korean meals. <br> <br>* Baendaengi is one of many types of small prey fish referred to as ‘Soeo’ for their fierce struggle in fishing nets. Soeo have internal organs that are proportionally smaller than other species of fish and are known for their feisty nature.

During the Byeonginyangyo (the French invasion in 1866), the French fleet stayed in Ganghwado for about a month until they withdrew their forces after losing during the Jeongjoksanseong Battle. During the Sinmiyangyo (the United States expedition to Korea in 1981), the American fleet attacked Chojijin Fortress, Deokjinjin Fortress and Gwangseongbo Fortress. Hence, Ganghwado played a big part in South Korea opening its doors to the West in the 19th century. Ganghwado also became the Western Christian missionaries' center of activity for their missionary works.<br><br>There are three remaining churches that were built in that time that were  influenced or built by the Western Christian Missionaries  Ganghwa Anglican Church established in 1900, Ganghwa St. Andrew's Church established in 1906, and Ganghwa Seodo Central Church established in 1923. <br><br>Ganghwa Seodo Central Church started contruction in February 1923 and was completed as a Korean-architecture chapel in July 1923. The original name was Jumun Church and it was renamed as Seodo Central (Jungang) Church in 1978. The church belongs to The Korean Methodist Church.<br><br>Even though the building of the church doesn't reflect outstanding building techniques and aesthetic qualities, a Western church with a Korean-style wooden structure such as Ganghwa Seodo Central Church is still worth a visit.","regDate":"2022-08-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Holy Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-08-13-1660387217022"},{"id":"2022-08-13-1660368996299","title":"Ganghwa Gyodongdo Island (교동도(강화))","description":"Gyodongdo Island is located northwest of the larger Ganghwado Island, and was made more accessible with the opening of Gyodongdaegyo Bridge in July 2014.

The island served as an important stopover point for ambassadors and envoys heading to China. Popular attractions on the island now include Daeryong Market, an alleyway market decorated with colorful murals and statues, and Manghyangdae Memorial, a gathering place for refugees who fled from the nearby Hwanghaedo Island during the Korean War. Many of the houses on Gyodongdo Island have swallow nests under the eaves. The refugees consider the swallows as guests from their hometowns. As such, the island is home to the peace & reunion themed Gyodong Swallow House, Peace Trail, and Gyodong Studio. Gyodong Swallow House serves as an exhibition and performance space. The Peace Trail is a biking path around the island. At Gyodong Studio, visitors can put on old school uniforms and take black-and-white photographs.","regDate":"2022-08-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-13-1660368996299/1890654_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-08-13-1660368996299"},{"id":"2022-08-13-1660357888699","title":"Baemikkumi Sculpture Park (배미꾸미조각공원)","description":"Baemikkumi Sculpture Park rests on Modo Island, one of the nearest islets to Yeongjongdo Island where Incheon International Airport is located.<br><br>The name 'baemikkumi' comes from the local dialect, as people say the island resembles the shape of a hole normally seen from the bottom of a ship as 'baemit' translates to the bilge, and 'kkumi' is most closely translated to mean 'a hole' in English. <br><br>The entire island has now become a beautiful exhibition hall of art works thanks to sculptor Lee Il-ho, who originally started and donated his talents for visitors coming to the island.
