A stone sculpture and a statue of Granny Samsin (a goddess that looks after babies’ births and keeps them healthy) also stand at the temple. However, the temple’s most treasured assets are its two Natural Monuments: Emerald Gaiety (a climbing vine, Natural Monument No. 380) and the Cheongsil Pear Tree (Natural Monument No. 386). Reverse icicles, though found all over the mountainsides, are most readily and abundantly found in the Eunsusa Temple area.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-63-433-2502|\n|parking:|Maisan Provincial Park Parking Lot|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|[Cultural Assets (Maisan Tapgun & Geumdangsa)]<br>Individuals - Adults 3,000 won / Teenagers 2,000 won / Children 1,000 won<br />Groups - Adults 2,800 won / Teenagers 1,600 won / Children 800 won<br /<br><br>* Group: 30 or more people|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Not available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-31-1659303488502/1605747_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659303488502/1605747_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659303488502/1605748_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659303488502/1605748_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659303488502/1605749_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659303488502/1605749_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659303488502/1605750_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659303488502/1605750_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659303488502/1605751_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659303488502/1605751_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659303488502/1605753_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659303488502/1605753_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-63-433-2502](tel:+82634332502)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.7594668368\nlongitude: 127.4144950983\ntitle: 406, Maisannam-ro, Jinan-gun, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Jeonju Intercity Bus Terminal, take an intercity bus to Jinan Bus Terminal. <br>\nFrom Jinan Bus Terminal, take a bus bound for Maisan.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-31-1659303488502","title":"Eunsusa Temple (은수사)","description":"The temple located upon Maisan Mountain was called Sangwonsa Temple during the early Joseon dynasty and was later known as Jeongmyeongam Hermitage.

Hanok houses are generally divided into two sections, <em>anchae</em> and <em>sarangchae</em>. Sarangchae is where the men dwell. Because men and women had to remain separated, anchae is situated deep inside the house so that it is secretive and quiet. <br /><br />Another trait of hanok is that all the houses are heated with ondol, a unique floor heating system. Since Koreans enjoy sitting, eating, and sleeping on the floor, it needs to remain heated in winter.

The highest peak of Naejangsan Mountain is Sinseonbong Peak, which is 763 meters above sea level. The nine peaks of the mountain stand in a circle, similar to the shape of a horse’s hoof.

The land was purchased by French Priest Baudenet in 1891 (28th year of King Gojong), but construction of the church did not begin until 1908. The church was designed by Priest Poinel, who also designed the famous Myeongdong Cathedral in Seoul. Construction was completed in 1914, a time during which Korea was under Japanese rule. Though originally built just outside of Pungnammun Gate, the site of the martyrs, the church was later moved to its current location for expansion.  <br><br>The first Romanesque building in the Honam region, Jeondong Catholic Cathedral is made of gray and red bricks and bears a striking resemblance to the Myeongdong Cathedral in Seoul. Not only considered one of the most beautiful Catholic churches in Korea, some even go so far as to say it is one of the most beautiful structures in all of Korea, citing the church’s unique combination of Byzantine and Romanesque architectural styles. The rectangular building is topped with three Byzantine bell towers (to the right, center, and left) and boasts arched ceilings, several of which meet in the form of a cross. <br><br>It is interesting to note that some of the bricks used in construction of the church were made using materials from the Jeonjueupseong Walled Town, which was torn down by the Japanese. It is also said that the cornerstone of the church came from a wall of Jeonjueupseong Walled Town near Pungnammun Gate.","regDate":"2023-01-04","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Holy Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-04-1672810566980/2641989_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-04-1672810566980"},{"id":"2023-01-04-1672807110323","title":"Jeoksangsanseong Fortress (무주 적상산성)","description":"Jeoksangsan Mountain (elevation 1,034m) in Muju, Jeollabuk-do, is surrounded by precipitous walls of stratified rocks.
