This pond was originally a reservoir made during the Japanese colonial period for irrigation, but was abandoned with the development of the Yeongsangang River system. The reservoir was recreated and expanded into todays lotus habitat thanks to the effort of Jeong Su-dong, who planted twelve lotus roots along the shoreline and took care of them dearly after dreaming of twelve white cranes landing upon the reservoir. The white lotus flowers in this pond blossom and fall from July until September. A lotus festival is held in August, when the flowers are at their peak.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-61-283-1325|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|[Blooming season] No closed dates<br> [Off season] Closed Mondays & public holidays|\n|usetime:|09:00‚Äì18:00<br> * Lotus blooming season: July 1 ‚Äì September 30|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Baengnyeon-ro, observatory deck, lawn plaza, theme park, bungalow, resting pavilion, drinking fountain, cafeteria, shade, acupressure trail, wild flower garden, etc.|\n|Admission Fees:|[Waterpark] <br>Individual: Adults 7,000 won / Teenagers & Children 6,000 won / Senior citizens & preschoolers 5,000 won<br>Group: Adults 6,000 won / Teenagers & Children 5,000 won / Senior citizens & preschoolers 4,000 won<br><br>* Children ages 3 & under - free of charge<br><br>[Camping fee]<br>Refer to the official website|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-26-1674722336812/1606959_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-26-1674722336812/1606959_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-26-1674722336812/1606961_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-26-1674722336812/1606961_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-26-1674722336812/1606963_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-26-1674722336812/1606963_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-26-1674722336812/1606964_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-26-1674722336812/1606964_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-26-1674722336812/2399159_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-26-1674722336812/2399159_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-26-1674722336812/2399160_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-26-1674722336812/2399160_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-26-1674722336812/2399164_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-26-1674722336812/2399164_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-26-1674722336812/2399166_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-26-1674722336812/2399166_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-26-1674722336812/2399170_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-26-1674722336812/2399170_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-26-1674722336812/1606960_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-26-1674722336812/1606960_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-61-283-1325](tel:+82612831325)\n- [üè†tour.muan.go.kr](http://tour.muan.go.kr/lotus)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 34.8601257396\nlongitude: 126.5299100793\ntitle: 333, Baengnyeon-ro, Muan-gun, Jeollanam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Seoul Central Bus Terminal, take an express bus to Muan Bus Terminal.<br>\nTake a taxi to Hoesan White Lotus Pond for approx. 40 min.\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-26-1674722336812","title":"Muan Hoesan White Lotus Pond (Î¨¥ÏïàÌöåÏÇ∞Î∞±Î†®ÏßÄ)","description":"Muan Hoesan White Lotus Pond is the largest habitat of white lotus in Asia, covering an area of approximately 330,000 square meters in Bogyong-ri, Muan-gun in Jeollanam-do.

Because it initially laid next to spring water as clean and cold as a morning dew, the temple was also called Gamrosa, meaning Sweet Dew Temple. The spring water was rumored to clean one‚Äôs body and soul, leading to crowd of Buddhist monks to visit the temple. During King Chungryeol‚Äôs reign, the temple was named the Best Temple in the south.<br><br>The temple was burned down during the Imjin War (1592-1598) and then later rebuilt and renamed Cheoneunsa. Legend has it that while the temple was being rebuilt, a large serpent often came out of the spring. When the serpent was finally captured and killed, the spring waters suddenly dried up. Hence the name Cheoneunsa, meaning Disappearance of Spring Water, was given.","regDate":"2023-02-04","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollanam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Jeollanam-do/2023-02-04-1675481763666"},{"id":"2023-02-03-1675420625446","title":"Geomundo Island (Í±∞Î¨∏ÎèÑ)","description":"Located approximately halfway between Yeosu and Jeju Island, Geomundo Island is part of the Dadohae Maritime National Park.
