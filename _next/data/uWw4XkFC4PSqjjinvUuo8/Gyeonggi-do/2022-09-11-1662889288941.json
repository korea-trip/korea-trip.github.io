The surrounding scenery of the Hantangang River area is truly breathtaking and is also the site of a famous amusement park. The Hantangang River Resort, located in the lower region of the Hantangang River, stretches along 1.5 kilometers of the river's shore between the Saranggyo Bridge and the Hantangyo Bridge in Jeongok-ri, Yeoncheon-gun. The Hantangang River flows from the Pyeonggang River in North Korea and through through Cheorwon, Pocheon and Yeoncheon and eventually joins the Imjingang River. The river features many scenic points including a large valley with cliffs that consist of many rare rocks. The resort is a great place for rest and relaxation, and has facilities for the whole family, maintaining campsites for cars and motor homes, a dinosaur-themed Children‚Äôs Character Park, Children‚Äôs Transportation Land, a water park, an ecological pond, and a soccer field.
