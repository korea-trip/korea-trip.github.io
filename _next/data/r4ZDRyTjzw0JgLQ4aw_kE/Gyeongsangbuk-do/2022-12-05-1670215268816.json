There are two, three-storied stone pagodas in the heart of Namsan Village and a small, elegant pond to the east. The pond is famous thanks to a Korean legend, written below <br><br>In the 10th year of King Soji (488) of Silla, a crow and a mouse approached the king as he was on his way to Namsan Mountain. The mouse told the King to ‚Äúfollow after the crow‚Äù for an easy journey. So, the King and his servant (who was traveling with him) followed the crow, but became distracted and lost their way. As they were wandering about a pond (now known as Seochulji), an old man appeared from the waters‚Äô depths and presented an envelope to the King. Based on the message in the envelope, the King instructed his servant to fire an arrow at the Geomungo (Korean musical instrument) case nearby. The shot killed the queen and a monk who had been hiding there, both of whom had been hatching a plot against the King. <br><br>The name of the pond, ‚ÄúSeochulji‚Äù (literally meaning ‚Äúwriting from the pond‚Äù) originates from this legend. It is said that a man named Imjeok built a building by the pond in the 5th year of King Hyeonjong (1664) to enjoy the scenery. The simple, yet elegant building still remains at the northwest of the pond.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-54-779-8743|\n|parking:|Available (Tongiljeon Parking Lot)|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Open 24 hrs|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Restrooms:|Available at Tongiljeon|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-05-1670215268816/214721_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-05-1670215268816/214721_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-05-1670215268816/214722_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-05-1670215268816/214722_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-05-1670215268816/214723_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-05-1670215268816/214723_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-05-1670215268816/214724_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-05-1670215268816/214724_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-05-1670215268816/2014057_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-05-1670215268816/2014057_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-05-1670215268816/2534162_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-05-1670215268816/2534162_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-05-1670215268816/2534163_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-05-1670215268816/2534163_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-05-1670215268816/2534167_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-05-1670215268816/2534167_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-05-1670215268816/2534169_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-05-1670215268816/2534169_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-05-1670215268816/2534166_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-05-1670215268816/2534166_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-54-779-6079](tel:+82547796079)\n- [üè†gyeongju.go.kr/tour](http://gyeongju.go.kr/tour)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.7964653616\nlongitude: 129.2420218400\ntitle: 17, Namsan 1-gil, Gyeongju-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Seoul Express Terminal, take bus to Gyeongju Bus Terminal.<br>\nFrom Gyeongju Bus Terminal Bus Stop, take Bus No. 11 and get off at Tongiljeon Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-05-1670215268816","title":"Seochulji Pond in Gyeongju (Lotus Flower) (Í≤ΩÏ£º ÏÑúÏ∂úÏßÄ)","description":"Located at the foot of Namsan Mountain in Gyeongju, Seochulji Pond dates back to the Three Kingdoms Period.
