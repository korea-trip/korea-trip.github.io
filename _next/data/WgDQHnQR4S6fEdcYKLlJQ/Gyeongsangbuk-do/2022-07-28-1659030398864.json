In 1972, while reconstruction work was being done on Geungnakjeon Hall, records were discovered stating the hall was repaired in 1363. This discovery gave concrete evidence that Geungnakjeon Hall is the oldest wooden building in the nation.","regDate":"2022-07-29","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-29-1659084304406/2654213_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-07-29-1659084304406"},{"id":"2022-07-29-1659080270985","title":"Bomunho Lake (Î≥¥Î¨∏Ìò∏)","description":"Bomunho Lake is a man-made lake 1,652,900 m&sup2; in size.

The combination of the stunning trees reflected in the waters of Bomunho Lake and the trees of Bulguksa Park gracefully adorning the nearby temple make for particularly stunning sights. When a light breeze blows, cherry blossoms gently flutter down like satin snow flakes.
