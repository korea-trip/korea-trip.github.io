However, despite their wide appearance, a lack of historical documents has hampered the true understanding of the statues. Bukchon Dol Hareubang Park puts together a wide variety of the statutes and, in doing so, illuminates their aesthetic and scholarly importance to visitors as well as future generations. In this sense, the park is not only a tourist attraction, but also a learning center for children and adults alike. The park consists of 48 Dol Hareubang, a promenade, reinterpreted Dol Hareubang focusing on the theme of peace, a traditional local garden with walking paths, and a learning center.<br><br>\n\n Dol Hareubang were previously called by various names, including Useokmok, Museokmok, or Byeoksumeori. Dol Hareubang became the official name in 1971 after being designated as a local folk heritage. Although Dol Hareubang were originally seen only around the entrance of government seats, there are over 48 officially recognized Dol Hareubang throughout the island (21 in Jeju City, 2 in National Folk Museum of Korea, 12 in Seongeup, and 13 in Daejeong), along with many replicas. The shamanistic statues are believed to offer protection and ward off demons. According to Tamnaji (Record of Tamna), Dol Hareubang are believed to have been initiated by Kim Mong-gyu, then Magistrate of Jeju in 1754 (30th year of King Yeongjo’s reign).\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-64-782-0570|\n|parking:|Available|\n|usetime:|April-October 09:00-18:00<br>November-March 09:00-17:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Adults 6,000 won / Teenagers 4,000 won |\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620008_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620008_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620009_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620009_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620010_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620010_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620011_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620011_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620012_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620012_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620013_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620013_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620014_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620014_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620015_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658216050635/1620015_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-64-782-0570](tel:+82647820570)\n- [🏠www.visitjeju.net](https://www.visitjeju.net/kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.5396035971\nlongitude: 126.6896605755\ntitle: 70, Bukchonseo 1-gil, Jeju-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>\nFrom Jeju Bus Terminal take a local bus bound for Seongsan and get off at Bukchon Elementary School Bus Stop. <Br> Walk for approx. 700 m towards Hallasan Mountain.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-19-1658216050635","title":"Bukchon Dol Hareubang Park (북촌 돌하르방공원)","description":"As a main symbol of Jeju Island, Dol Hareubang, literally meaning \"Old Grandfather\" stone statues, can be found everywhere on the island.

The top has a large, deep funnel-shaped crater that still preserves its original shape unlike craters in cones. The name Darangswi is derived from the fact that the mountain looks like a moon ('Da' meaning 'Moon' and 'Swi' meaning 'Mountain' in the Jeju dialect).<br><br>Trees are scattered here and there at the top, and the outskirts of the mountain are decorated with cedar trees. Meadow plants such as Aster yomena populate most of the mountain. A gentle hill to the right of Darangswi Oreum is called Akkeun Darangswi Oreum (also called Sowol Nangak). Meaning 'small,' 'Akkeun' is both old Korean and Jeju dialect.<br><br>Darangswi Oreum hosts Wollang Peak Sunrise Festival every year allowing visitors to see the spectacular full moon from the crater. There are wooden stairs in place for easy ascent, and the mountain is also a popular site for paragliders.","regDate":"2022-07-19","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-19-1658245342348/2652528_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2022-07-19-1658245342348"},{"id":"2022-07-19-1658241314969","title":"Daheeyeon Garden (다희연)","description":"Daheeyeon Garden is a major tea farm on Jeju Island, which has the best conditions for growing great tea in a natural environment.

Jusangjeolli Cliff was formed when the lava from Hallasan Mountain erupted into the sea of Jungmun. They are rock pillars shaped like cubes or hexagons of various sizes and almost seem as if stone masons had carved them out. The administration of the district named them 'Jisatgae Rocks' from their old name 'Jisatgae'. The 20m cliff makes it a popular spot for high tide and sea angling. The waves of the high tide crashing into the side of the cliff provide a breathtaking view of the ocean surrounding the pillars.","regDate":"2022-07-19","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-19-1658238893407/197693_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2022-07-19-1658238893407"},{"id":"2022-07-19-1658236093306","title":"Daejeonghyanggyo Confucian School (대정향교)","description":"Daejeonghyanggyo was a Confucian school during Joseon Dynasty.
