The remains mostly belong to independence activists including Yoon Bong-gil, Lee Bong-chang, and Baek Jeong-gi, whose graves are collectively known as Samuisa Tomb.

Among the other patriotic martyrs who are interred in the park are Kim Gu and some of the key figures of the provisional government such as Lee Dong-nyeong, Cha I-seok, and Cho Seong-hwan.
