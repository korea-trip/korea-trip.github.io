Japanese Minister, Miura Goro saw her as a threat and ordered her assassination.  After hearing news of the Empress‚Äôs assassination, King Gojong and the Crown Prince sought refuge in the Russian Embassy for one year.  \n<br>\n\n<br>\nAfter 1945, the Soviet Union took over the embassy until it was almost completely destroyed by a fire during the Korean War [1950~1953].  The only remaining parts of the building are the tower and basement areas. The building was restored to its current condition in 1973 and is now enjoyed by many as a public park.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-2-3396-5882|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-09-1660013586382/1569251_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-09-1660013586382/1569251_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-09-1660013586382/1569252_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-09-1660013586382/1569252_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-09-1660013586382/2459038_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-09-1660013586382/2459038_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-09-1660013586382/2459039_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-09-1660013586382/2459039_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-09-1660013586382/2459040_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-09-1660013586382/2459040_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-09-1660013586382/2459041_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-09-1660013586382/2459041_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-09-1660013586382/2459044_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-09-1660013586382/2459044_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-09-1660013586382/2459047_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-09-1660013586382/2459047_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-09-1660013586382/2459048_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-09-1660013586382/2459048_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-09-1660013586382/1569253_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-09-1660013586382/1569253_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-2-3396-5882](tel:+82233965882)\n- [üè†www.junggu.seoul.kr</a> (Korean, English) <br><a href=\"http://www.cha.go.kr/\" target=\"_blank\">www.cha.go.kr](http://www.junggu.seoul.kr/tour/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5684261216\nlongitude: 126.9714160575\ntitle: 21-18, Jeongdong-gil, Jung-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway]<BR>City Hall Station (Seoul Subway Line 1 or 2), Exit 1 or 12.
