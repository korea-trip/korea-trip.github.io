The royal tombs were moved to Seooreung Tombs in the waning months of the Japanese colonial period. The Japanese empire began the development of Hyochangwon into a park in 1924, and the Japanese governor-general officially assigned the site as a park in 1940.<br><Br>Presently, several of Korea‚Äôs greatest leaders are buried in Hyochang Park. The remains mostly belong to independence activists including Yoon Bong-gil, Lee Bong-chang, and Baek Jeong-gi, whose graves are collectively known as Samuisa Tomb. A statue of Lee Bong-chang has been built in the graveyard. Among the other patriotic martyrs who are interred in the park are Kim Gu and some of the key figures of the provisional government such as Lee Dong-nyeong, Cha I-seok, and Cho Seong-hwan. An ancestral shrine named Uiyeolsa has been built along the main gate and holds the portraits of the deceased independence activists.","regDate":"2022-08-09","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-09-1660030622688/1568015_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-08-09-1660030622688"},{"id":"2022-08-09-1660027663398","title":"Seoul Hwagyesa Temple (ÌôîÍ≥ÑÏÇ¨(ÏÑúÏö∏))","description":"Hwagyesa Temple was built in 1522 (the seventeenth year of the reign of King Jungjong of the Joseon dynasty) by monk Shinwol, but was destroyed in a fire in 1618.
