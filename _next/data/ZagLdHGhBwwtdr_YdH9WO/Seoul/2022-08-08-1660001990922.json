In the past, the forest had been a royal hunting ground for kings and served as a military inspection facility. However, in more recent decades, the area has served a wide variety of functions. Ttukseom initially served as a water treatment facility, and later as a golf course, horse racing track, and eventually a sports park. <br>\n<br>\n Consisting of five parks spread over approximately 595,000 „é° of land, Seoul Forest is an eco-friendly zone appreciated not only by the people of the city but also those visiting Seoul. Seoul Forest is rapidly developing into the premium city-park of Korea like Hyde Park in London and Central Park in New York. <br>\n<br>\n * Culture & Art Park<br>\n Situated in the heart of Seoul Forest, Culture & Art Park features Seoul Forest Plaza, decorative flower beds, Visitor Center, a skate park, outdoor stage, waterside lounge (restaurant), in-forest open space, in-forest play ground and water play area. <br>\n<br>\n * Eco Forest <br>\n The Eco Forest, once an area covered by the Hangang River, has been transformed into an eco-forest connecting the Hangang River and Jungnangcheon Stream. This natural habitat for wildlife is home to fallow deer, formosan deer, elk, chipmunks, mandarin ducks, mallards, spot-billed ducks and moorhens. There is also an observatory to help visitors get a better view of the local wildlife. <br>\n<br>\n * Experiential Learning Park<br>\n Occupying the structure of the former Ttukseom Water Treatment Facility, this refurbished educational area was established to house an insect botanical garden, wild flower garden, themed flower garden, event ground and surrounding protective forest. <br>\n<br>\n * Marsh Plants Garden<br>\n Making use of the local reservoir‚Äôs natural environment, the Wetlands Ecological Field contains a wetlands ecological management office, ecological playground, outdoor nature classroom, bird observatory, wetlands flower garden and botanical garden fed with local, clear waters. <br>\n<br>\n * Hangang Riverside Park <br> Located southwest of Seoul Forest, this riverside area at the junction of the Hangang River and Jungnangcheon Stream features a waterfront park, marina and rest area.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-2-460-2905|\n|opendate:|June 18, 2005|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)<br> * Some facilities are closed on Mondays|\n|usetime:|[Ecological Forest] 05:30-21:30 <br>[Insect Garden] 11:00-16:00  (Closed Mondays & Tuesdays)<br>[Butterfly Garden] 11:00-16:00 (Closed Mondays & Tuesdays; Operates at the Insect Garden 2F November-April)<br>[Water Fountain] May, June, September 13:00, 14:00, 15:00, 16:00 / July-August 12:00, 13:00, 14:00, 15:00, 16:00 (30 min show / No operation on Mondays)<br>[Visitor Center] March-October 10:00-18:00 / November-February 10:00-17:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Ecology forest, deer park, insect garden, butterfly garden, water fountain, forest playground, etc.|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-08-1660001990922/1857233_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-08-1660001990922/1857233_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-08-1660001990922/1876181_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-08-1660001990922/1876181_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-08-1660001990922/1876182_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-08-1660001990922/1876182_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-08-1660001990922/2611302_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-08-1660001990922/2611302_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-08-1660001990922/2611303_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-08-1660001990922/2611303_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-08-1660001990922/2611304_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-08-1660001990922/2611304_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-08-1660001990922/2611305_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-08-1660001990922/2611305_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-2-460-2905](tel:+8224602905)\n- [üè†seoulforest.or.kr](http://seoulforest.or.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5430553337\nlongitude: 127.0417770333\ntitle: 273, Ttukseom-ro, Seongdong-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-08-1660001990922","title":"Seoul Forest (ÏÑúÏö∏Ïà≤)","description":"Opened on June 18, 2005, Seoul Forest had previously undergone a series of changes on Ttukseom Island.

The royal tombs were moved to Seooreung Tombs in the waning months of the Japanese colonial period. The Japanese empire began the development of Hyochangwon into a park in 1924, and the Japanese governor-general officially assigned the site as a park in 1940.<br><Br>Presently, several of Korea‚Äôs greatest leaders are buried in Hyochang Park. The remains mostly belong to independence activists including Yoon Bong-gil, Lee Bong-chang, and Baek Jeong-gi, whose graves are collectively known as Samuisa Tomb. A statue of Lee Bong-chang has been built in the graveyard. Among the other patriotic martyrs who are interred in the park are Kim Gu and some of the key figures of the provisional government such as Lee Dong-nyeong, Cha I-seok, and Cho Seong-hwan.
