The name Bukchon, which literally translates to \"northern village,\" came about as the neighborhood lies north of two significant Seoul landmarks, Cheonggyecheon Stream and Jongno. Today, many of these hanoks operate as cultural centers, guesthouses, restaurants and tea houses, providing visitors with an opportunity to experience, learn and immerse themselves in traditional Korean culture. As Bukchon Hanok Village is an actual neighborhood with people's homes, visitors are advised to be respectful at all times while looking around.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-2-2148-4161|\n|parking:|Not available|\n|restdate:|Sundays|\n|usetime:|Weekdays & Saturdays 10:00-17:00<br>* Applies to 100-m long road along Bukchon-ro 11-gil|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Tour Course Information:|[dobo.visitseoul.net](http://english.visitseoul.net/walking-tour/BukchonHanokVillage_/622)|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Available Facilities:|Cafe, workshops, museum, etc.|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Jaedong Primary School Tourist Information Center:<br> +82-2-2148-4160 (English, Japanese)<br><br>Jeongdok Library Tourist Information Center: <br>+82-2-2148-4161 (English, Japanese, Chinese)|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-21-1658376681775/2363673_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658376681775/2363673_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658376681775/2363674_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658376681775/2363674_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-2-2148-4161](tel:+82221484161)\n- [üè†hanok.seoul.go.kr](http://hanok.seoul.go.kr/front/index.do)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5791612548\nlongitude: 126.9864254967\ntitle: 37, Gyedong-gil, Jongno-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway]<br>\nAnguk Station (Seoul Subway Line 3), Exit 1 or 2.<br> Go straight for approx. 300m to arrive at Bukchon Hanok Village.<br><br>\n\n[Bus]<br>\nTake Maeul Bus Jongno 02 and get off at Bukchon Hanok Village Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-21-1658376681775","title":"Bukchon Hanok Village (Î∂ÅÏ¥åÌïúÏò•ÎßàÏùÑ)","description":"Surrounded by Gyeongbokgung Palace, Changdeokgung Palace and Jongmyo Shrine, Bukchon Hanok Village is home to hundreds of traditional houses, called <em>hanok</em>, that date back to the Joseon dynasty.

The royal tombs were moved to Seooreung Tombs in the waning months of the Japanese colonial period. The Japanese empire began the development of Hyochangwon into a park in 1924, and the Japanese governor-general officially assigned the site as a park in 1940.<br><Br>Presently, several of Korea‚Äôs greatest leaders are buried in Hyochang Park. The remains mostly belong to independence activists including Yoon Bong-gil, Lee Bong-chang, and Baek Jeong-gi, whose graves are collectively known as Samuisa Tomb. A statue of Lee Bong-chang has been built in the graveyard. Among the other patriotic martyrs who are interred in the park are Kim Gu and some of the key figures of the provisional government such as Lee Dong-nyeong, Cha I-seok, and Cho Seong-hwan. An ancestral shrine named Uiyeolsa has been built along the main gate and holds the portraits of the deceased independence activists.","regDate":"2022-08-09","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-09-1660030622688/1568015_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-08-09-1660030622688"},{"id":"2022-08-09-1660027663398","title":"Seoul Hwagyesa Temple (ÌôîÍ≥ÑÏÇ¨(ÏÑúÏö∏))","description":"Hwagyesa Temple was built in 1522 (the seventeenth year of the reign of King Jungjong of the Joseon dynasty) by monk Shinwol, but was destroyed in a fire in 1618.
