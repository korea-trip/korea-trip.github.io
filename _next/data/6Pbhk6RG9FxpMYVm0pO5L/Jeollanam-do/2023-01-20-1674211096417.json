Every part of Gurye deserves the title of Special Tourist Zone for offering many things to see. Well-known for its rich soil, the most outstanding natural resources of Gurye is Jirisan National Park, the first to be designated as a national park, and Seomjingang River. <br><br>Every year, many hikers visit Jirisan National Park, also called the ‚Äúbosom of a mother.‚Äù The park is cherished for its unpolluted scenery, such as its deep and wide geographical features and crystal clear valleys. The park offers diverse hiking trails and has mountain retreats for backpackers. <br><br>Jirisan Dulegil Trail that runs along the periphery of Jirisan Mountain is where one could enjoy the experience of mountain glens, different from mountaineering. On their way hikers and trekkers can see groups of Sansuyu (cornus fruit) in spring as well as the autumnal tints of the mountain and valley in autumn. <br><br>Another strength is that the park has different types of accommodations including Hanok (Korean traditional house) homestay and a guest house, apart from leisure facilities including hot springs in Jirisan. The park is a great place for historical inquiries as it is filled with historic temples, including Hwaeomsa Temple and Yeongoksa Temple, and historic relics. Flowing from Gokseong to Hadong, Seomjingang River creates a tranquil ambience. The cleanest ever in Korea, a large number of marsh snails and sweetfish live in this river. Visitors can also enjoy the scenic view from the riverside road and various festivals which are held all year round, such as the Sansuyu Festival, the Seomjingang Riverside Cherry Flower Festival and the Piagol Autumn Foliage Festival. <br><br>* Current State of Gurye Special Tourist Zone<br>1) Districts Covered / Areas around Toji, Masan, Gwangui and Sandong-myeon, Gurye-gun, Jeollanam-do<br>2) Area / 78,024,000„é° <br><br>* Tourist Attractions<br>Jirisan Mountain, Seomjingang River, Jirisan Spa Land, Piagol Valley, Sansuyu Theme Park, Hwaeomsa, Cheoneunsa and Yeongoksa Temple, Hanok Village, etc.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-61-780-2450|\n|parking:|9 public parking lots are available at Jirisan National Park, the banks of Seomjingang River and temples|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Facilities for the Handicapped:|Wheelchairs are allowed on the deck path by Soemjingang River|\n|Available Facilities:|Tourist information center, tourist hotel, resort condominiums, Oncheonjang hot springs, entertainment restaurant, souvenir shop, traditional market, etc.|\n|Restrooms:|90 public restrooms are available at Jirisan National Park and temples|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Leaflets in Chinese and Japanese available at Hwaeomsa Temple Tourism Information Center|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-20-1674211096417/644214_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-20-1674211096417/644214_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-20-1674211096417/1606837_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-20-1674211096417/1606837_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-20-1674211096417/1606838_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-20-1674211096417/1606838_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-20-1674211096417/1917878_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-20-1674211096417/1917878_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-20-1674211096417/1970882_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-20-1674211096417/1970882_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-20-1674211096417/1970883_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-20-1674211096417/1970883_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-20-1674211096417/644268_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-20-1674211096417/644268_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-20-1674211096417/1917885_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-20-1674211096417/1917885_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-20-1674211096417/1917886_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-20-1674211096417/1917886_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-61-780-2450](tel:+82617802450)\n- [üè†culture.gurye.go.kr](http://tour.gurye.go.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.2573140182\nlongitude: 127.4977425065\ntitle: 539, Hwaeomsa-ro, Gurye-gun, Jeollanam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>\nFrom Seoul Nambu Bus Terminal, take a bus to Gurye Bus Terminal.\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-20-1674211096417","title":"Gurye Special Tourist Zone (Íµ¨Î°Ä Í¥ÄÍ¥ëÌäπÍµ¨)","description":"The vast region of the Gurye Special Tourist Zone comprises Toji-myeon, Gwangui-myeon and Sandong-myeon, which has a river and an open field surrounding the mountainous area.

The reservoir was recreated and expanded into todays lotus habitat thanks to the effort of Jeong Su-dong, who planted twelve lotus roots along the shoreline and took care of them dearly after dreaming of twelve white cranes landing upon the reservoir.

The area is home to 27 historical and cultural sites and the beautiful Haebochoen Stream, which is shaded by over 40 different types of trees including zelkova trees, nettle trees, and willow trees. Some of the town‚Äôs traditional houses, which are about 80 years old, offer guesthouse accommodations to tourists.
