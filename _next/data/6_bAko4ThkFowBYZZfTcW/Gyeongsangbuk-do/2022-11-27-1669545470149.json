The pond features three small islands, and a landscape of 12 small hills to the northeast. After the fall of Silla, the site was abandoned and forgotten. The pond was referred to as Anapji from the Goryeo and Joseon periods and onwards. In the 1980s, a pottery fragment with the letters “Wolji” (a pond that reflects the moon) carved onto it was found, revealing the true name of the pond. After the discovery, the site was renamed to the current Donggung Palace and Wolji Pond.","regDate":"2022-11-27","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-27-1669534579762/2612561_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-11-27-1669534579762","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-11-27-1669534579762"},{"id":"2022-11-27-1669531284691","title":"Gyeongju Bulguksa Temple [UNESCO World Heritage] (경주 불국사 [유네스코 세계문화유산])","description":"Bulguksa Temple is a representative relic of Buddhist culture from the Silla kingdom.
