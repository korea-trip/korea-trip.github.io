It offers a spectacular view of the winding Nakdonggang River and beautiful rock formations peeking through the branches of the old pine trees. The path to the observatory goes through a forest of pine trees.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info +82-54-536-7040|\n|opendate:|April 3, 1989|\n|parking:|Available (108 spaces)|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Tour Course Information:|Artificial waterfall - Yuraebi - red clay path & stone path - observatory - Gyeongcheondae Cliff - wooden bridge - filming site - suspension bridge - overpass - hexagon pavilion - artificial waterfall|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Available Facilities:|Observatory, campground, wooden bridge, suspension bridge, walking paths, etc.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-26-1669455358142/181021_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-26-1669455358142/181021_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-26-1669455358142/181053_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-26-1669455358142/181053_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-26-1669455358142/1697082_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-26-1669455358142/1697082_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-26-1669455358142/1697083_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-26-1669455358142/1697083_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-26-1669455358142/1697085_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-26-1669455358142/1697085_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-26-1669455358142/1697086_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-26-1669455358142/1697086_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-26-1669455358142/1697097_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-26-1669455358142/1697097_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-26-1669455358142/1697099_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-26-1669455358142/1697099_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-26-1669455358142/1697101_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-26-1669455358142/1697101_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-26-1669455358142/181020_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-26-1669455358142/181020_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-54-536-7040](tel:+82545367040)\n- [üè†www.sangju.go.kr](https://www.sangju.go.kr/tour/main.tc)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.4582827307\nlongitude: 128.2440300692\ntitle: Samdeok-ri, Sangju-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Dong Seoul Terminal or Nambu Bus Terminal, take a bus to Sangju Bus Terminal. <br>\nTake a bus to Gyeongcheondae Cliff.\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-26-1669455358142","title":"Gyeongcheondae Cliff (ÎÇôÎèôÍ∞ï Í≤ΩÏ≤úÎåÄ(Í≤ΩÏ≤úÎåÄ Ï†ÑÎßùÎåÄ))","description":"With a magnificent view made up of cliffs and old pine trees, Gyeongcheondae Cliff was once called Jacheondae due to the belief that it came from the sky.
