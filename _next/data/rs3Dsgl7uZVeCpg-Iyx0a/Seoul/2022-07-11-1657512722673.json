After visiting the site, Doseonguksa made a prophecy that led to the construction of the temple. According to legend, he used only his walking stick to carve the large Bodhisattva that sits at the temple. Interestingly enough, the statue does not show any evidence of chisel marks, further adding to the mystery of how the statue was made.  <br><br>During the 7th year of King Gwangmu of the Joseon dynasty, Doseonsa Temple was officially named the representative temple of Korea with the purpose of promoting Cheongdamdaejongsa's Korean Buddhism movement, aiming at a religious revival. Due to these special circumstances Deseonsa Temple gained a high reputation and much recognition, which have held strong to this day.<br><br>Inside the temple, visitors can view the remains and written works of Cheongdamdaejongsa in the Cheongdamdaejongsa Memorial Hall.
