It was not until the eighth year of Gwanghaegun (1616) that the palace was used as a royal residence for the king, changing the name to Gyeongdeokgung Palace. The name later changed again to the current Gyeonghuigung Palace in 1760. The palace grounds included many halls but they were mostly all burned down in a fire in 1829. After the Japanese occupation began, all remaining buildings on the site were torn down and the palace grounds were turned into Gyeongseong Middle School (now Seoul High School). The school moved to Gangnam area in 1987, afterwhich the previous location was turned into a park. The palace grounds currently hold Seoul Museum of Art and walking paths, as well as a restoration of Heunghwamun Gate, the main gate of the palace, and Sungjeongjeon Hall, the main hall, completed in November 1994.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-2-724-0274~6|\n|parking:|Seoul Museum of History Parking Lot|\n|restdate:|Mondays, January 1|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|[Cars with less than 20-person capacity]<BR> 3,000 won for the first two hours / 400 won for every additional 5 min / 15,000 won all-day parking<BR><BR>[Cars with 20-person capacity or more]<BR>6,000 won for the first two hours / 800 won for every additional 5 min / 30,000 won for all-day parking|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-23-1658597858400/1568229_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658597858400/1568229_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658597858400/1568230_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658597858400/1568230_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658597858400/1568232_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658597858400/1568232_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658597858400/1568233_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658597858400/1568233_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658597858400/1568234_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658597858400/1568234_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658597858400/1568235_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658597858400/1568235_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658597858400/1568236_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658597858400/1568236_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658597858400/1568237_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658597858400/1568237_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658597858400/2526504_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658597858400/2526504_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-23-1658597858400/2526505_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-23-1658597858400/2526505_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-2-724-0274](tel:+8227240274)\n- [üè†www.heritage.go.kr</a><br><a href=\"https://museum.seoul.go.kr/www/intro/annexIntro/annex_20/annex_20_01.jsp?sso=ok\" target=\"_blank\">museum.seoul.go.kr](http://www.heritage.go.kr/heri/cul/culSelectDetail.do?pageNo=1_1_1_1&ccbaCpno=1331102710000)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5704425020\nlongitude: 126.9685079323\ntitle: 45, Saemunan-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-23-1658597858400","title":"Gyeonghuigung Palace (Í≤ΩÌù¨Í∂Å)","description":"Gyeonghuigung Palace, Historic Site No. 271, was originally called the large palace by Saemun Gate, or the Western Palace, for its location within the city.
