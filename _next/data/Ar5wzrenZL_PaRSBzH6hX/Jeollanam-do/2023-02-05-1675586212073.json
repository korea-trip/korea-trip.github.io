Gatbawi is named after its shape, which is said to look like two men wearing traditional Korean hats called “gat” (“bawi” meaning “rock”). The rock is actually made of two individual formations  one measuring 8 meters tall and one 6 meters tall. Valued not only for its aesthetics, Gatbawi Rock is of high geological value as a “natural sculpture” that was formed as a result of years of weathering. The rock formation was officially recognized as Natural Monument No. 500 on April 27, 2009.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-61-270-8598|\n|usetime:|[Gatbawi Rock Coastal Walkway]<br> Summer 05:00-24:00<br> Winter 05:00-23:00<br>* Access may be restricted on days of typhoon, heavy rain, heavy snow, fogs or other unforeseen circumstances.|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-02-05-1675586212073/1609494_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-05-1675586212073/1609494_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-05-1675586212073/1609495_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-05-1675586212073/1609495_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-05-1675586212073/1609496_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-05-1675586212073/1609496_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-05-1675586212073/1609497_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-05-1675586212073/1609497_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-05-1675586212073/1804627_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-05-1675586212073/1804627_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-05-1675586212073/1804628_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-05-1675586212073/1804628_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-05-1675586212073/2654154_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-05-1675586212073/2654154_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-61-270-8598](tel:+82612708598)\n- [🏠mokpo.go.kr</a> (Korean only)<br><a href=\"http://www.cha.go.kr/\" target=\"_blank\">www.cha.go.kr](http://mokpo.go.kr/tour)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 34.7939980843\nlongitude: 126.4222850732\ntitle: 149, Namnong-ro, Mokpo-si, Jeollanam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus + Taxi]<br>\nFrom Mokpo Intercity Bus Terminal, take a taxi for approx. 10 min.\n","data":{"id":"2023-02-05-1675586212073","title":"Mokpo Gatbawi Rock (목포 갓바위)","description":"Located on the coast of Yonghae-dong in Mokpo, Gatbawi is a natural sandstone and tafoni formation near the mouth of the Yeongsangang River, where freshwater runs into the sea.
