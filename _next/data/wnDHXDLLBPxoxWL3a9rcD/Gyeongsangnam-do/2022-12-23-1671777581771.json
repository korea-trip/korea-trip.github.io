The valley is surrounded by Jeongjoksan Mountain to the northeast, Wonjeoksan Mountain to the south, and Cheonseongsan Mountain to the southeast. The water running through the numerous valleys between these mountains has formed streams like Yongyeoncheon and Sangnicheon, which form the Yangsancheon Stream out of Naewonsagyegok Valley.<br><br>Naewonsagyegok Valley was formerly called Sogeumgang (little Geumgang), meaning that its beautiful scenery is comparable to that of the breathtaking Geumgangsan Mountain. It is also known as the ‚Äúmystical valley‚Äù as crystal clear water flows all year round. The word ‚ÄúSogeumgang‚Äù is distinctly engraved on one side of the cliff and large rocks stand in layers throughout the valley. Some of the rocks are called Byeongpungbawi Rock, literally meaning folding screen rocks, as they are stretched out much like folding screens. <br><br>The valley and the surrounding mountains are a popular summer vacation spot and a well-known hiking destination during the spring, fall, and winter. Muk (acorn jelly) made with acorns gathered from this area not only tastes great, but is also very healthy. Nearby attractions include Tongdosa Temple and Hongnyongpokpo Falls.<br><br>* Entrance into the upper region of Naewonsagyegok Valley is restricted.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-55-380-4826|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Adults - 2,000 won|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-23-1671777581771/1228101_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-23-1671777581771/1228101_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-23-1671777581771/1228111_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-23-1671777581771/1228111_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-23-1671777581771/1228112_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-23-1671777581771/1228112_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-23-1671777581771/1228117_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-23-1671777581771/1228117_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-23-1671777581771/1228127_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-23-1671777581771/1228127_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-23-1671777581771/1228135_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-23-1671777581771/1228135_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-55-380-4826](tel:+82553804826)\n- [üè†www.yangsan.go.kr](http://www.yangsan.go.kr/tour)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.4243519049\nlongitude: 129.1047970740\ntitle: 207, Naewon-ro, Yangsan-si, Gyeongsangnam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Taxi]<br>\nApprox. 30 min from Yangsan Intercity Bus Terminal.\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-23-1671777581771","title":"Naewonsagyegok Valley (ÎÇ¥ÏõêÏÇ¨Í≥ÑÍ≥°)","description":"Naewonsagyegok Valley is located just below Naewonsa Temple at the foot of Cheonseongsan Mountain.

The glittery surface and towering cliffs create a spectacular backdrop. Clear footprints of dinosaurs that lived during the Cretaceous Period of the Mesozoic Era remain extending over the coast around Sangjogam region, and thus the area was designated Goseong-gun Gosi No. 20. on November 10, 1983. <br>The beach in front of the Youth Center contains shingles worn down by the tide and a precipitous wall of stratified rocks can be seen beyond the wide bedrock of dinosaur footprints. The rocks are named after the table leg-shaped stone caves such as ‚ÄúSsangjok‚Äù or ‚ÄúSsangbal‚Äù. Many oddly shaped rocks inside the caves have their own folktales.<br>According to one tale, fairies from heaven came down to the Sangjokgul Cave to weave clothes out of brocade for the King of Heaven, and bathed in the Seonnyoetang Pond. The shape of a loom and a puddle still exist. Nearby the cave, Chotdaebawi Rock and Byeongpungbawi Rock create scenery beyond description and leisure cruise boats toss up gentle sea waves. Naturally, the park continuously attracts numerous tourists in all seasons. <br>Also, many are drawn to the mysterious dinosaur footprint fossils at Sangjogam. The site is recognized as one of three major dinosaurs sites in the world, along with those in Brazil and Canada. The footprints belong to dinosaurs familiarized by the popular movie, ‚ÄòJurassic Park‚Äô, such as Brontosaurus, Brachiosaurus, Allosaurus and Naranosaurus. It has been designated Natural Monument No. 411, as dinosaur footprints are valuable resources in discovering the uncovered mysteries of life before the appearance of mankind.","regDate":"2022-12-29","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","County Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-29-1672303057153/1611219_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-29-1672303057153"},{"id":"2022-12-29-1672299315401","title":"Samcheonpodaegyo Park (ÏÇºÏ≤úÌè¨ÎåÄÍµêÍ≥µÏõê)","description":"Samcheonpodaegyo Park is located near the landmark of Namhae, Samcheonpodaegyo Bridge, which connects Sacheon-si to nearby island.","regDate":"2022-12-29","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Architectural Sights","Bridges"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-29-1672299315401"},{"id":"2022-12-29-1672295914657","title":"Okpo Shipyard of Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (ÎåÄÏö∞Ï°∞ÏÑ†Ìï¥Ïñë(Ï£º) Ïò•Ìè¨Ï°∞ÏÑ†ÏÜå)","description":"Okpo Shipyard of Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering spans over a 4000,000„é° land and consists of large-scale specialized facilities and equipments for shipbuilding and repairs such as a dock that can handle a 1,000,000 ton vessel and a 900 ton Goliath crane.
