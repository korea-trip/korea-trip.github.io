Well-known films and soap operas include Seoul 1945, Fighter in the Wind, Gyeongseong Scandals, Meeting Plaza, Dachimawa Lee, Modern Boy and East of Eden. The park is one of the largest film and television studio sets in Korea.<br><br>The theme park is located in Gahori, Yongju-myeon (Hapcheon) and covers an area of over 231,406.00„é°. It is divided into two main sets separately owned by the major broadcasting companies KBS and MBC. The section owned by KBS houses reproductions of Seoul landmarks such as Seoul Station, Chosun Governor-General Office, and the Bando Hotel, as they appeared from the 1930s to the 1960s. MBC‚Äôs set focuses mainly on reproductions of streets from Sogong-dong, Seoul from the 1970s and 80s. A walk around this major filming location will transport visitors back into the Seoul of yore, a Seoul vastly different from the one people know and love today.<br><br>After a set is used for a film or a soap opera, the City of Hapcheon remodels and displays it as a type of exhibit, chronicling the area‚Äôs anthropologic development. In the future, the city plans to expand exhibits to include a facility where visitors can view a collection of historic military pieces.<br>&nbsp;<br>\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-55-930-3752~5,<br>+82-55-930-3744,<br> +82-55-930-3743 (Nighttime)|\n|usetime:|9:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 5,000 won / Students & Children 3,000 won / Seniors (ages 65 or more) & People with disabilities (lvl. 4 or higher) 2,500 won<br>Groups - Adults 3,000 won / Students & Children 2,000 won / Seniors (ages 65 or more) & People with disabilities (lvl. 4 or higher) 1,500 won<br><br>* Free admission (proof required): People with disabilities (lvl. 1-3), Children (ages 6 or younger), etc.|\n|Available Facilities:|Filming set (40 sites), agricultural and specialty product sales market, restaurant, etc.|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-19-1671435346356/1867861_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-19-1671435346356/1867861_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-19-1671435346356/1867864_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-19-1671435346356/1867864_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-19-1671435346356/1867866_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-19-1671435346356/1867866_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-19-1671435346356/1867869_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-19-1671435346356/1867869_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-19-1671435346356/1867872_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-19-1671435346356/1867872_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-19-1671435346356/1867862_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-19-1671435346356/1867862_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-19-1671435346356/1867867_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-19-1671435346356/1867867_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-19-1671435346356/1867868_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-19-1671435346356/1867868_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-19-1671435346356/1867870_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-19-1671435346356/1867870_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-19-1671435346356/1867873_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-19-1671435346356/1867873_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-55-930-3752~5](tel:+82559303752~5)\n- [üè† theme.hc.go.kr](http://culture.hc.go.kr/contents/view_contents/contents_2_1)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.5491995167\nlongitude: 128.0713092811\ntitle: 757, Hapcheonhosu-ro, Yongju-myeon, Hapcheon-gun, Gyeongsangnam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \nFrom the \nSeoul Nambu Bus Terminal, take a bus towards Hapcheon<br>(5 buses daily at 10:08, \n12:00, 14:00, 15:00, 16:45.

The footprints are deeply imprinted in the wide sheets of rocks arrayed along Dongdaeman Beach. Researchers believe that these enormous footprints belong to a species of huge pterosaur, and visitors can see about 60 smaller footprints that are believed to belong to early humans. The dinosaur footprints and other cretaceous fossils are located along the cape by the shore, so you must time your visit well to see them. According to paleontologists, the footprints are the evidence of three specimens of herbivorous  sauropoda, which walked on two 60 centimeter-long feet; two specimens of ornithopoda, which were also herbivores, that had three toes on each foot; and one specimen of another ornithopod species, a carnivore that had sharp claws and walked on two feet. The layout of the footprints alludes to a situation where the herbivores were walking in a group followed by a carnivore preparing for an attack! <br><br>","regDate":"2022-12-27","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Eco-Tourism Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-27-1672133762383/212944_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-27-1672133762383"},{"id":"2022-12-27-1672130246490","title":"DPIRANG (ÎîîÌîºÎûë)","description":"DPIRANG is a digital nighttime theme park in Nammangsan Park that consists of 15 walking paths decorated with lights.

Further investigation of the tumuli revealed several important and interesting facts. First, from the end of the third century, men and horses were buried alive along with the dead. Also, weapons were bent and buried as well, with many of these artifacts being unearthed among the tumuli. Other materials found in the tumuli such as cylindrical bronze items, pinwheel-shaped bronze items, and jasper items showed that Gaya was involved in trade with Japan. The Daeseong-dong Tumuli is significant in that it gives a glimpse into the political and social structure of the Gaya Kingdom, and the cultural exchange between Korea, China, and Japan.","regDate":"2022-12-27","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-27-1672119336198"},{"id":"2022-12-27-1672115914882","title":"Yeonhwasan Provincial Park (Ïó∞ÌôîÏÇ∞ÎèÑÎ¶ΩÍ≥µÏõê)","description":"Yeonhwasan Mountain, located in Goseong, Gyeongsangnam-do, is just 524 meters tall, encompasses the three peaks of Ongnyeobong, Seondobong and Mangseonbong, and is widely recognized as an important provincial park.
