The Tongyeong base served as the central command station for the three other naval bases in the Gyeongsang, Jeolla and Chungcheong regions. <br><br>Not only is Mireukdo Island designated as a Special Tourist Zone, it is also a part of the Hallyeohaesang National Park and serves as the center of tourism in the South Coast. The Mireukdo Special Tourist Zone, with the Donam Tourist Complex as its core, is well-equipped with a variety of leisure facilities, tourist accommodations and restaurants. This district caters to visitors with yacht services and a variety of water sports such as windsurfing, kayaking and water skiing. Exceptionally popular is the ferry cruise that takes visitors to Hansando Island, which is located just off the coast of Tongyeong, and to the other scenic islands such as Bijindo and Maemuldo. <br><br>Mireukdo Island is connected to Tongyeong through an undersea tunnel, Chungmu Bridge and Tongyeong Bridge, making it even more accessible to visitors. At the center of the island is the towering Mireuksan Mountain. The panoramic Hallyeosudo Viewing Ropeway, which opened in 2008, takes visitors to the summit of Mireuksan Mountain. The top offers a commanding view of the forests and valleys below. On a clear day, visitors can even see the Japanese island of Tsushima. The mountain’s hiking trails are well-maintained and are suitable for short hikes. The most traveled trail is the one starting from Yonghwasa Temple. Hikers taking this trail pass through Gwaneumsa Temple and Mireukjae Pass to reach the top. The trail leads to Miraesa Temple and a grass field on the way down before finally going back to Yonghwasa Temple.<br><br><br><b>Mireukdo Special Tourist Zone </b><br><b>Areas Covered </b> Part of Sanyang-eup (Mireukdo Island and Obido Island), areas of Misu-dong, Bongpyeong-dong and Donam-dong in Tongyeong-si, Gyeongsangnam-do<br><b>Area size </b> 32,900,000 ㎡<br><b>Tourist Attractions </b> Hallyeosudo Viewing Ropeway,  Ferry Cruise, Tongyeong Concert Hall, Undersea Tunnel\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <BR> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-55-648-9133|\n|parking:|Public parking lots at the Mireuksan tourist sites|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Tourist information center, Hallyeosudo Viewing Ropeway, beaches, tourist hotels, resort condominiums, ferry cruise, tourist restaurants, etc.|\n|Restrooms:|5 public restrooms near the Mireukdo tourist sites|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Travel information in English, Chinese and Japanese on the Tongyeong Cultural Tourism website.|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-22-1671694567115/1204915_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-22-1671694567115/1204915_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-22-1671694567115/1204919_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-22-1671694567115/1204919_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-22-1671694567115/1204924_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-22-1671694567115/1204924_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-22-1671694567115/1823752_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-22-1671694567115/1823752_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-22-1671694567115/1823753_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-22-1671694567115/1823753_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-22-1671694567115/1823754_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-22-1671694567115/1823754_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-22-1671694567115/1823758_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-22-1671694567115/1823758_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-55-648-9133](tel:+82556489133)\n- [🏠www.utour.go.kr](http://www.utour.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 34.8258204881\nlongitude: 128.4253835789\ntitle: Donam-dong, Tongyeong-si, Gyeongsangnam-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-22-1671694567115","title":"Mireukdo Island Special Tourist Zone (미륵도 관광특구)","description":"Mireukdo Island is located in Tongyeong, a city that holds great historical significance for being the home of the Tongjeyeong naval station during the Joseon dynasty.
