It stretches over 1.5 kilometers with a x_width of 30 meters; there are over 2,000 trees that create canopies with x_heights varying from 10 to 15 meters. The forest boasts over 100 different species of trees — from hackberries to oaks, zelkovas, fringe trees, muku trees, and silver magnolias. All in all, 10,000 trees create the feeling of being in an ancient forest, deep in the mountains.<br><br>The forest was built by people in nearby villages 300 years ago in order to control winds and waves.

Mulgeon-ri is divided into two areas  the port with a lighthouse, and farmlands, with the forest in between the two. From German Village in Namhae, scenic overlooks provide sweeping views of Mulgeon-ri, the forest, and the port.<br><br>The forest is called a variety of names; it is called Bangpungrim (Windbreak Forest) because it protects villages from gusty winds; Eoburim (Fish shelter Forest) because its lush trees attract schools of fish; and Bangjorim (Waterbreak Forest) because it lessens the severity of waves and tides.<br><br>Home to German Village, Mulgeon-ri faces eastward. Naturally, it is a great spot to see the sunrise and sunset. While Jeongdongjin is renowned for its splendid sunrise on the East Coast, Mulgeon-ri shares the acclaim on the South Coast, attracting thousands of visitors at the dawn of every New Year.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-55-860-8605|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-23-1671773763251/2652511_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-23-1671773763251/2652511_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-23-1671773763251/2652512_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-23-1671773763251/2652512_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-55-860-8605](tel:+82558608605)\n- [🏠www.cha.go.kr](http://www.cha.go.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 34.7832378893\nlongitude: 128.0410209758\ntitle: Mulgeon-ri, Namhae-gun, Gyeongsangnam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nTake an intercity bus from Seoul Nambu Bus Terminal to Namhae.<br>From Namhae Intercity Bus \nTerminal, take a bus bound for Mulgeon Windbreak Forest.\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-23-1671773763251","title":"Mulgeon Windbreak Forest (남해 물건리 방조어부림)","description":"Namhae in Gyeongsangnam-do, with coastal lines stretching over 302 kilometers, is surrounded by 70 beautiful islands.
