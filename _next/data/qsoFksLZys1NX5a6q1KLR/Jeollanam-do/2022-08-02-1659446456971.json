Among the 80 poems he published, more than 60 were written in this place where he lived a life resisting Japanese imperialism and refusing to change his name to a Japanese name. After he moved to Seoul in 1948, his birthplace was resold several times, but the county of Gangjin-gun bought it in 1985 to restore it to its original state with a thatched-roof.
