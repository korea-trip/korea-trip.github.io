It is a rapid means of traveling between downtown Sokcho and Abai Village along the 50 m-long waterway. This small barge-style boat without an engine can be run by pulling the wire manually. When fixing the solid steel wire on both sides of the waterway and pulling it hard with a hook, a boat moves forward slowly. As there is no boatman, passengers need to work together to move the boat. It takes about 5 min to cross the water by boat. This unique experience still attracts many tourists to Sokcho. Furthermore, it is known as the filming location for the Korean TV drama Autumn in My Heart, so many tourists from Japan and China visit the place.","regDate":"2022-07-24","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Culture/Art/History","Experience Programs","Unique Experience"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-24-1658634922819/2636684_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-07-24-1658634922819","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Gangwon-do/2022-07-24-1658634922819"}],"navList":["Busan","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
