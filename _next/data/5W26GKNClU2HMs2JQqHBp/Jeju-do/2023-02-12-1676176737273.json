{"pageProps":{"content":"![Seogwipo Recreational Forest (서귀포자연휴양림)](/2023-02-12-1676176737273/1207811_image2_1.webp)\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> Seogwipo Recreational Forest is Korea’s southernmost recreational park that serves as an excellent nature getaway by preserving the mountain’s forest environment and ecosystem while minimalizing manmade structures as much as possible. The park is located approximately 700 meters above sea level, and is 10 °C lower in average temperature compared to that of Seogwipo’s downtown, providing the ideal condition to enjoy forest bathing and camping from spring to fall. The park is easily accessible by car, thanks to the paved road from the mountain’s foothills all the way up to the park’s entrance. It takes about 30 minutes by car from Seogwipo’s downtown to the recreational park. The park is densely packed with trees and the air is filled with the refreshing forest scent, and even has a pebble walking trail suitable for a barefoot massage. The forest is equipped with amenities such as a mountain cottage, forest bathing site, campfire site, cooking area, and auto-camping site. Although the amenities serve to provide visitors’ convenience, they are minimized so as to prevent damage to the forest’s natural environment.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-64-738-4544|\n|opendate:|March 21, 1995|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|[Park hours] 09:00-18:00 (Last admission 17:00)<br>[Accommodations] Check-in 15:00 / Check-out 12:00<br>[Campsite] Check-in 13:00 / Check-out 12:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Parking Fees:|Compact cars 1,000 won / Small & mid-sized cars 2,000 won / Large-sized cars and vans 3,000 won|\n|Facility Utilization Fees:|[House in the Forest ]<br> Off-season and weekdays 46,000~104,000 won / Peak season and weekends 85,000~184,000 won<br><br> [Forest Recreational Center]<br> Off-season and weekdays 34,000~63,000 won / Peak season and weekends 60,000~107,000 won<br> * Admission and parking fees are exempted.<br> <br> [Group lodging]<br> Off-season and weekdays 200,000 won / Peak season and weekends 250,000 won<br> *   Additional fees may apply.

The exquisite landscape makes it one of the most beautiful places to dive as well. Going deep into the 40 meter sea-bed, visitors can see countless fish, rare iridescent coral reefs, and a surreal-looking shipwreck with schools of fish surrounding it. Over 20 years of technical knowhow and safe operation (in fact, the longest submarine tour without a single accident on record) make Seogwipo Submarine a must-see attraction on Jeju Island.","regDate":"2023-02-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Cruises/Submarines"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-12-1676180133673/1618776_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-12-1676180133673"},{"id":"2023-02-12-1676173046682","title":"Seogwipo New Paradise Cruise (서귀포유람선 뉴파라다이스호)","description":"Seogwipo New Paradise Cruise offers dazzling scenery on the coastal lines and islands around Seogwipo Port in Jeju.
