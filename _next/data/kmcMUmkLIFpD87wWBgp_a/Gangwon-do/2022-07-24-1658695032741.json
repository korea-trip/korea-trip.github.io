When no one else was brave enough to find his body, Eom Heung-do, the governor of Yeongwol Lake, found his body and buried him in the tomb that later became Jangneung, one of the royal tombs of the Joseon dynasty. Danjong had been stripped of his title at the time he was exiled. His title was later restored in year 1698, during the reign of King Sukjong, and received his posthumous name Danjong, and thereafter was referred to as King Danjong. <br><br>Jangneung houses such buildings as Jeongjagak, Baesikdansa, Jaesil, Yeongcheon, and Hongsammun, and a history hall with relics of Danjong. The area is surrounded by magnificent pine trees. Since 1967, a religious service called Danjongje is held every year on April 5th, according to the lunar calendar, in commemoration of Danjong.","regDate":"2022-10-01","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-01-1664600620874/564597_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-01-1664600620874"},{"id":"2022-09-30-1664534949242","title":"Isabu Lion Park & Picture Book Land (Ïù¥ÏÇ¨Î∂ÄÏÇ¨ÏûêÍ≥µÏõê&Í∑∏Î¶ºÏ±Ö ÎÇòÎùº)","description":"Isabu Lion Park & Picture Book Land is a family-friendly theme park that provides the beautiful ocean view of the East Sea up close.
