Despite the tragic incident of November 2010 shelling from North Korea, this bucolic island offers many natural and cultural attractions.<br><br>\n<b>Island History<br></b>\nThe earliest known history of Socheongdo Island comes from Chungmin-sa Temple, which was built to commemorate the island's once abundant but now extinct fish species called Yellow corbina (Sciaenidae). This fish was related to the family of fish commonly called drums, croakers, or hardheads for the repetitive throbbing or drumming sounds they make. When the economy flourished thanks to profitable fishing, the Socheongdo port was congested with fishing boats, so much that it was said that one could cross from one island to the next by walking over boats. The species of fish is depleted, and the island remains as quiet with views of North Korea.<br><br>\nIn November 2010, Socheongdo Island was hit by the fatal shelling from North Korea that killed two civilians and two soldiers. In recent months, the island has made an attempt to recover its tourism industry and to develop security tourism by blending its newer military presence at tourist attractions.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) • For more info: +82-32-899-3450|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-12-1660340265213/1385402_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-12-1660340265213/1385402_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-12-1660340265213/2496368_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-12-1660340265213/2496368_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-12-1660340265213/2496369_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-12-1660340265213/2496369_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-12-1660340265213/2496384_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-12-1660340265213/2496384_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-12-1660340265213/2496385_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-12-1660340265213/2496385_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-12-1660340265213/2496386_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-12-1660340265213/2496386_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-12-1660340265213/2496388_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-12-1660340265213/2496388_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-12-1660340265213/2496389_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-12-1660340265213/2496389_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-12-1660340265213/1385387_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-12-1660340265213/1385387_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-32-899-3450](tel:+82328993450)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.6649371493\nlongitude: 125.7020074536\ntitle: 3, Yeonpyeongjungang-ro 24beon-gil, Ongjin-gun, Incheon\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Ferry]<BR>\nTake a passenger ferry from Yeonan Port.<BR> \n* Ferry schedule is subject to change, depending on the season and weather conditions.\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-12-1660340265213","title":"Yeonpyeongdo Island (연평도(대/소 연평도))","description":"Yeonpyeongdo Island is a small island resided by fishing communities.
