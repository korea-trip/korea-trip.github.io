From the moment you start walking down the stonewall-lined path into town, this small village will capture your heart. The village‚Äôs important history (including its title as the origin of Hampyeong-gun of Jeollanam-do Province) is evident in everything you see  from the traditional houses to the 500-year old forest. The area is home to 27 historical and cultural sites and the beautiful Haebochoen Stream, which is shaded by over 40 different types of trees including zelkova trees, nettle trees, and willow trees. Some of the town‚Äôs traditional houses, which are about 80 years old, offer guesthouse accommodations to tourists. They include Mopyeongheon, Sopungga and Hisomun (a house made of yellow sod).<Br><Br>In addition to the beautiful country scenery, there is a great selection of available programs that highlight the area‚Äôs specialties, including  mulberry-picking, silkworm-feeding and Korean traditional sauce-making. You can also visit a traditional watermill, which has been restored, and swim and splash around in the forest stream. Visitors are encouraged to try their hand at making green tea cakes at the traditional teahouse nearby. <br><Br>The area of Mopyeong is full of things to entertain visitors, including a number of attractions and special events. Some of the area‚Äôs most praiseworthy attractions are the Hampyeong Butterfly Festival, the Cluster Amaryllis Festival in Yongcheonsa Temple, the Chrysanthemum Festival, and the Hampyeong Eco Park and Folk Museum. <br><Br>Other towns well worth a visit in the Mopyeong area are Hamo Maeul, Ungok Maeul and Wonsan Maeul. A stay at Wonsan Maeul gives visitors a chance to experience firsthand the reality of an agricultural lifestyle by doing some activities like mulberry-picking. For a more low-key trip, make your way over to Ungok Maeul, where you can enjoy the fantastic scenery at the lake or take a relaxing walk along the hiking trails of Mt. Wolyangsan.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-61-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-61-320-1783|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Accommodations|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-26-1674715167198/1608253_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-26-1674715167198/1608253_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-26-1674715167198/1608254_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-26-1674715167198/1608254_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-26-1674715167198/1608255_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-26-1674715167198/1608255_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-26-1674715167198/1810075_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-26-1674715167198/1810075_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-26-1674715167198/1810077_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-26-1674715167198/1810077_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-26-1674715167198/1810082_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-26-1674715167198/1810082_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-26-1674715167198/1810086_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-26-1674715167198/1810086_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-26-1674715167198/1810098_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-26-1674715167198/1810098_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-26-1674715167198/1810099_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-26-1674715167198/1810099_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-26-1674715167198/1608251_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-26-1674715167198/1608251_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-61-320-2772](tel:+82613202772)\n- [üè†hampyeong.go.kr](https://hampyeong.go.kr/tour/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.1604068068\nlongitude: 126.5943525751\ntitle: 80, Sangmo-gil, Hampyeong-gun, Jeollanam-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-26-1674715167198","title":"Mopyeong Village (Î™®ÌèâÎßàÏùÑ)","description":"Located in Hampyeong-gun, Jeollanamdo, Mopyeong Village is a scenic farming village that is rich in tradition and history.
