Iljasan Mountain is one of the best spots in Seoul to watch the sunrise. Located on the mountain is the house of Master Lee Jip (pen-name Dunchon), providing a good getaway spot for local residents. Lee Jip was a loyal government official during the reign of King Gongmin during the late Goryeo dynasty. He was forced to move to an underground tunnel in the southwest side of Iljasan Mountain to avoid entrapment by Shin Don, a person of influence at the time. While living in hiding, he took the pen-name Dunchon (meaning drawing back to the countryside) to symbolize the hardships he was going through. The nearby area was named after him, being called Dunchon-dong.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-2-3425-6443|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Available Facilities:|Indoor and outdoor badminton venue, gymnasium, X-game hall, plaza, parking lot, Chohwaryu Hall, ecological pond, etc.|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659478_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659478_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659479_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659479_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659480_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659480_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659481_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659481_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659482_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659482_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659485_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659485_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659487_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659487_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659490_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659490_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659492_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659492_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659486_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659486_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n\n- [🏠parks.seoul.go.kr](http://parks.seoul.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5327334966\nlongitude: 127.1508007360\ntitle: 660, Dongnam-ro, Gangdong-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\n- Take Blue Bus No. 361 and get off at Bohun Hospital. <Br>\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-04-1659589577365","title":"Iljasan Mountain Natural Park (일자산자연공원)","description":"Iljasan Mountain is the tallest peak in Gangdong-gu, Seoul, providing the western boundary between Gangdong-gu and Hanam-si, Gyeonggi-do.

Pungnaptoseong Fortress faces Hangang River to its west and connects to Mongchontoseong Fortress to the south. To the northwest faces Achasanseong Fortress over Hangang River and far to the southeast is Namhansanseong Fortress.<br><br>Pungnaptoseong Fortress, located at the south end of Cheonhodaegyo Bridge over Hangang River, is one of the remains of Early Baekje. Originally, the fortress was 4km in circumference, but due to massive overflowing of Hangang River during flood season in 1925, most of the fortress was lost and only 2.7km of it remains. To the east of the fortress are 4 vestiges of the fortress gates. The remains from the prehistoric era through the  Samguk (Three States) era have been unearthed, indicating that this place was a residential area well before the Baekje Era. Through vigorous excavation, some people suggest that there used to be a  palace located here during the Baekje Era.","regDate":"2022-08-07","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Fortresses"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-07-1659840061906/566413_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-08-07-1659840061906"},{"id":"2022-08-07-1659834580035","title":"Olympic Park (올림픽공원)","description":"Olympic Park is an impressive leisure facility in which historic remains from the Baekje era share space with modern, state-of-the-art sports stadiums, an eco-friendly forest, and spacious grass fields.

Upon entering from the front gate, visitors will get a taste of Korea's traditional life while escaping from the bustling city life. The traditional garden with its pavilion and old houses creates a peaceful ambiance before the forested Namsan Mountain.

Each house was originally located in different neighborhoods, but they were all moved to this area and restored to their original form. The houses were rebuilt using their original materials, except for one house, where the materials were too old and deteriorated to be reused. The premises were carefully restored and replicated according to their original form to depict the owners’ social class and personality. These buildings are now used as an exhibit to portray the living environment during the Joseon dynasty as well as a venue for educational and cultural programs for children and tourists.<br><br>Some of the noteworthy programs and activities to participate in include wearing hanbok, folding hanji (traditional Korean paper), writing in Korean, traditional tea ceremony, traditional etiquette school and herbal medicine experience.
