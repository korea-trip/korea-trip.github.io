But exact location is still unknown. One thing for sure, however, is that Pungnaptoseong Fortress, Mongchontoseong Fortress, Bangidong Ancient Tombs of Baekje, Seokchondong Stone Mound Tomb of Early Baekje are the remains of Baekje. Pungnaptoseong Fortress faces Hangang River to its west and connects to Mongchontoseong Fortress to the south. To the northwest faces Achasanseong Fortress over Hangang River and far to the southeast is Namhansanseong Fortress.<br><br>Pungnaptoseong Fortress, located at the south end of Cheonhodaegyo Bridge over Hangang River, is one of the remains of Early Baekje. Originally, the fortress was 4km in circumference, but due to massive overflowing of Hangang River during flood season in 1925, most of the fortress was lost and only 2.7km of it remains. To the east of the fortress are 4 vestiges of the fortress gates. The remains from the prehistoric era through the  Samguk (Three States) era have been unearthed, indicating that this place was a residential area well before the Baekje Era. Through vigorous excavation, some people suggest that there used to be a  palace located here during the Baekje Era.","regDate":"2022-08-07","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Fortresses"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-07-1659840061906/566413_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-08-07-1659840061906"},{"id":"2022-08-07-1659834580035","title":"Olympic Park (Ïò¨Î¶ºÌîΩÍ≥µÏõê)","description":"Olympic Park is an impressive leisure facility in which historic remains from the Baekje era share space with modern, state-of-the-art sports stadiums, an eco-friendly forest, and spacious grass fields.

A time capsule commemorating Seoul‚Äôs 600th anniversary was buried in 1994 at the highest point of the village and is scheduled to be reopened 400 years later in 2394. <br><br> The five hanok premises at Namsangol Hanok Village once belonged to aristocrats and government officials of the Joseon dynasty. Each house was originally located in different neighborhoods, but they were all moved to this area and restored to their original form. The houses were rebuilt using their original materials, except for one house, where the materials were too old and deteriorated to be reused. The premises were carefully restored and replicated according to their original form to depict the owners‚Äô social class and personality. These buildings are now used as an exhibit to portray the living environment during the Joseon dynasty as well as a venue for educational and cultural programs for children and tourists.<br><br>Some of the noteworthy programs and activities to participate in include wearing hanbok, folding hanji (traditional Korean paper), writing in Korean, traditional tea ceremony, traditional etiquette school and herbal medicine experience.
