The name changed with different dynasties, being Gomokgeunhyeon during the Goguryeo Era and Gyodonghyeon under the reign of Silla King Gyeongdeok. The island served as an important stopover point for ambassadors and envoys heading to China. Popular attractions on the island now include Daeryong Market, an alleyway market decorated with colorful murals and statues, and Manghyangdae Memorial, a gathering place for refugees who fled from the nearby Hwanghaedo Island during the Korean War. Many of the houses on Gyodongdo Island have swallow nests under the eaves. The refugees consider the swallows as guests from their hometowns. As such, the island is home to the \"peace & reunion\" themed Gyodong Swallow House, Peace Trail, and Gyodong Studio. Gyodong Swallow House serves as an exhibition and performance space. The Peace Trail is a biking path around the island. At Gyodong Studio, visitors can put on old school uniforms and take black-and-white photographs.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br> • For more info: +82-32-934-1000|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-13-1660368996299/1890654_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-13-1660368996299/1890654_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-13-1660368996299/1890665_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-13-1660368996299/1890665_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-13-1660368996299/1890668_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-13-1660368996299/1890668_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-13-1660368996299/1890669_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-13-1660368996299/1890669_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-13-1660368996299/1989964_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-13-1660368996299/1989964_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-13-1660368996299/1989971_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-13-1660368996299/1989971_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-13-1660368996299/1989979_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-13-1660368996299/1989979_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-13-1660368996299/1890653_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-13-1660368996299/1890653_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-13-1660368996299/1890659_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-13-1660368996299/1890659_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-13-1660368996299/1989950_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-13-1660368996299/1989950_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-32-934-1000](tel:+82329341000)\n- [🏠www.ganghwa.go.kr](http://www.ganghwa.go.kr/open_content/tour/trip/ex_kyodong.jsp)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.7803447584\nlongitude: 126.2809677323\ntitle: 35, Gyodongnam-ro, Ganghwa-gun, Incheon\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-13-1660368996299","title":"Ganghwa Gyodongdo Island (교동도(강화))","description":"Gyodongdo Island is located northwest of the larger Ganghwado Island, and was made more accessible with the opening of Gyodongdaegyo Bridge in July 2014.
