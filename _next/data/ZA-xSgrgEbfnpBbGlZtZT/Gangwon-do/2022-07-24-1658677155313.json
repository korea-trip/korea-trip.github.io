Photos of the family on vacation there show Kim Jungil as a young boy of six years. The building was constructed entirely of stone in 1938 by a German architect for the Sherwood Hall missionary family, and features a basement level and two above-ground floors. The house is now open to the public, with an exhibition of how the house was used by the Kim family, faithfully recreated from photographic research.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>• For more info: +82-33-680-3677|\n|opendate:|July 1999|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Summer 09:00-18:00 <br>Winter 09:00-17:30<br>* Last ticketing 1 hr before closing|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|[Hwajinpo History & Security Museum] <br />Individuals: Adults 3,000 won / Teenagers & Children 2,300 won <br />Groups: Adults 2,300 won / Teenagers & Children 1,600 won <br /><br>* Group: 30 people or more<br />* Admission includes Villa of Rhee Syngman, Villa of Lee Ki-poong, Castle of Hwajinpo & Ecology Museum <br />* Free admission: senior citizens (ages 65 and older)|\n|Restrooms:|Available at parking lot|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Available - English, Japanese, Chinese<br>* Advance reservation required at Hwajinpo Tourist Information Center|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-24-1658677155313/2600598_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658677155313/2600598_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658677155313/2600599_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658677155313/2600599_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658677155313/2600600_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658677155313/2600600_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658677155313/571638_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658677155313/571638_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658677155313/571640_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658677155313/571640_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658677155313/571641_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658677155313/571641_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-33-680-3677](tel:+82336803677)\n- [🏠www.gwgs.go.kr](https://www.gwgs.go.kr/tour/index.do)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 38.4725399459\nlongitude: 128.4431686945\ntitle: 280, Hwajinpo-gil, Goseong-gun, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus + Taxi]<br>\nFrom Dong Seoul Bus Terminal, take a bus to Ganseong Intercity Bus Terminal.<br>From Ganseong Bus Terminal, take a taxi for approx. 15 min.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-24-1658677155313","title":"Castle at Hwajinpo (화진포의 성(김일성별장))","description":"The Castle of Hwajinpo was the summer retreat for Kim Ilsung, former leader of North Korea, and his family from 1948 to 1950.

Due to this battle, the communist Chinese army suffered around 14,000 casualties and the army completely collapsed while the 9th Infantry Division won the Battle of Baengmagoji and got the nickname “White Horse.” <br><br>After the battle, the area gave off a bad smell because of the dead bodies. The mountain area lost its original shape due to the severe battle and as a result the area was named “Baengmagoji” as it was said to resemble a white horse (baengma) lying down.","regDate":"2022-10-05","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Security & Peace Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-05-1664956394526/2384030_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-05-1664956394526"},{"id":"2022-10-05-1664953656471","title":"Manhae Village (만해마을)","description":"Manhae Village was established as a training center and memorial hall for national activist Monk Manhae Han Yongun, revered for his literary and philosophical inspiration, as well as his devotion to the nation and Korean people during the Democracy Movement.","regDate":"2022-10-05","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Folk Villages"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-05-1664953656471/2601654_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-05-1664953656471"},{"id":"2022-10-05-1664950030242","title":"Mangyeongdae Pavilion (만경대)","description":"Mangyeongdae Pavilion, located on the shore of the East Coast, one-kilometer east of Donghae City Hall, was built in 1613 while old Joseon was under the rule of King Gwanghaegun.

While offering a spectacular view of sea to the east, the pavilion also offers a refreshing view of expansive pine forests to the north. If you look to the west, you will enjoy a magnificent view of Dutasan Mountain beyond the pavilion’s back lawn as well as the Jeoncheon Stream flowing into the East Sea alongside a steep cliff-wall.
