The communist Chinese army launched a major offensive attack for 10 days on October 6, 1952 during the Battle of Baengmagoji, which can be translated into the Battle of White Horse Highlands. Due to this battle, the communist Chinese army suffered around 14,000 casualties and the army completely collapsed while the 9th Infantry Division won the Battle of Baengmagoji and got the nickname “White Horse.” <br><br>After the battle, the area gave off a bad smell because of the dead bodies. The mountain area lost its original shape due to the severe battle and as a result the area was named “Baengmagoji” as it was said to resemble a white horse (baengma) lying down.","regDate":"2022-10-05","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Security & Peace Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-05-1664956394526/2384030_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-05-1664956394526"},{"id":"2022-10-05-1664953656471","title":"Manhae Village (만해마을)","description":"Manhae Village was established as a training center and memorial hall for national activist Monk Manhae Han Yongun, revered for his literary and philosophical inspiration, as well as his devotion to the nation and Korean people during the Democracy Movement.","regDate":"2022-10-05","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Folk Villages"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-05-1664953656471/2601654_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-05-1664953656471"},{"id":"2022-10-05-1664950030242","title":"Mangyeongdae Pavilion (만경대)","description":"Mangyeongdae Pavilion, located on the shore of the East Coast, one-kilometer east of Donghae City Hall, was built in 1613 while old Joseon was under the rule of King Gwanghaegun.

While offering a spectacular view of sea to the east, the pavilion also offers a refreshing view of expansive pine forests to the north. If you look to the west, you will enjoy a magnificent view of Dutasan Mountain beyond the pavilion’s back lawn as well as the Jeoncheon Stream flowing into the East Sea alongside a steep cliff-wall.
