Palgongsan Mountain is located 20 kilometers northeast from downtown Daegu, where the Nakdonggang and Geumhogang Rivers meet. The mountain has three peaks in a row: Birobong Peak (1192.3 meters) in the center and Dongbong (aka ‘Mitabong,’ 1,155 meters) and Seobong (aka ‘Samseongbong,’ 1,150 meters) on each side.\n<br><br>\nThe park is within the administrative district of Dong-gu, Daegu and has four towns along its border including Yeongcheon-si, Gyeongsan-si, and Chilgok-gun. A number of Buddhist temples including Donghwasa, the headquarters of the 9th Buddhist Parish, are located in the area.\n<br><br>\nThe park has numerous rocks and valleys and is carpeted with azaleas in the spring. In the autumn many visitors flock to the park to admire the fall leaves on the trees lining the 16.3-kilometer-long roadway that runs through the park. With vibrant green leaves in spring and a delicate snowscape in the winter, Palgongsan Mountain is an attractive destination for visitors throughout the year.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-53-939-0080|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year around)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Mountain Not Access Period:|Annual Forest Fire Prevention Period<br>Spring: February 15 - May 15 / Autumn: November 1 - December 15<br />* Subject to change based on weather conditions |\n|Hiking Course:|* Course 1<br>Ticket Office - Donghwasa Temple - Budoam Hermitage  - Yeomburam Hermitage  - Dongbong Peak - Seobong Peak<br>* Course 2<br>Ticket Office - Donghwasa Temple - Naewonam Hermitage - Yeombulbong Peak - Dongbong Peak<br>* Course 3<br>Ticket Office - Donghwasa Temple - Yaksuam Hermitage  - Pokpogol Valley - Sillyeongjae Hill|\n|Available Facilities:|Donghwa facility organization, camping area, Daegu Citizen Safety Theme Park, Donghwasa Temple, etc.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-15-1660571844401/655660_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-15-1660571844401/655660_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-15-1660571844401/1574268_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-15-1660571844401/1574268_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-15-1660571844401/1574269_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-15-1660571844401/1574269_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-15-1660571844401/1574270_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-15-1660571844401/1574270_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-53-939-0080](tel:+82539390080)\n- [🏠www.daegu.go.kr](https://www.daegu.go.kr/env//index.do?menu_id=00000914)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.9899388189\nlongitude: 128.6961615543\ntitle: 1, Donghwasa 1-gil, Dong-gu, Daegu\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-15-1660571844401","title":"Palgongsan Natural Park (Donghwasa Temple District) (팔공산자연공원(동화사지구))","description":"Palgongsan Natural Park is located close to Palgongsan Mountain, one of the larger mountains in the Taebaek Mountain Range.

It was during the time of Mun Gyeong-ho (1812-1874), the 18th descendant of Mun Ik-jeom, that the clan became established in Inheung. Mun executed his plan to create a village for the clan by putting down roots in the old site of Inheungsa Temple, a large-scale temple in the Goryeo era. <br><br>Yonghojae, which is a place for offering ancestral memorial services, is the first building established at the village constructed before or after 1920. The first residential building was built around the late 1800s in the form of thatched cottage. During the course of a hundred years, the village developed into what it is today. Featuring about 70 or so tile-roofed homes, Inheung Village is only about 200 years old but it is a great example of traditional residential homes of the em>yangban</em> upper class in the Yeongnam region. The harmony between the way the village is organized and the surrounding landscape is unique and rare.","regDate":"2022-08-15","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Daegu","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Folk Villages"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-15-1660549026542/1574148_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Daegu/2022-08-15-1660549026542","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Daegu/2022-08-15-1660549026542"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
