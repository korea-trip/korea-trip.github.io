Mun executed his plan to create a village for the clan by putting down roots in the old site of Inheungsa Temple, a large-scale temple in the Goryeo era. <br><br>Yonghojae, which is a place for offering ancestral memorial services, is the first building established at the village constructed before or after 1920. The first residential building was built around the late 1800s in the form of thatched cottage. During the course of a hundred years, the village developed into what it is today. Featuring about 70 or so tile-roofed homes, Inheung Village is only about 200 years old but it is a great example of traditional residential homes of the em>yangban</em> upper class in the Yeongnam region. The harmony between the way the village is organized and the surrounding landscape is unique and rare.","regDate":"2022-08-15","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Daegu","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Folk Villages"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-15-1660549026542/1574148_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Daegu/2022-08-15-1660549026542"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
