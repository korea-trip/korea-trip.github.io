The reinforced stonewall has a circumference of approximately 1,760 meters, 5-8 meters in x_height and contains three wells and springs. According to Ha Ryun’s Seongmungi in Donggukyeojiseungnam Record, the fortress was frequently destroyed during invasions and was reinforced by Jinju’s minister, Kim Jung-gwang during the fifth year of Goryeo Woo King’s reign (1379). During this period, the circumference was 800 bo(pace), with Uijeongmun Gate to the east, Jijemun Gate to the north, and Yehwamun Gate to the south. Outside the castle, Cheongcheon River flows in the west, Namgang River in the south and a pond lies between the castle and the trench dug during the war times. As a fortress to safeguard from attacks, it blocked enemies from advancing toward Honam during the 25th year of Joseon Seonjo King’s reign (1592). Within the fortress lies Chokseoknu, Kim Shi-min Memorial, Uigisa Shrine, Seojangdae, Bukjangdae, Changyeolsa shrine, Jinju National Museum, Hoguksa Temple, and an outdoor stage.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-55-749-5170|\n|parking:|Available<br>- Gongbukmun Parking (large-sized parking: 9 spaces / small-sized parking: 26 spaces)<br>- Health Center Parking Lot (small-sized parking: 84 spaces)<br>- Jinjuseong Fortress Tour Bus Parking Lot (tour bus parking: 14 spaces)|\n|usetime:|Ticketing Office 09:00-18:00<BR>March-October 05:00-23:00<BR>November-February 05:00-22:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 2,000 won / Teenagers 1,000 won / Children 600 won<br>Groups - Adults 1,400 won / Teenagers 600 won / Children 400 won<br> * Group: 30 or more people<BR>* Free admission: Preschoolers (ages 7 and yonger), senior citizens (ages 65 and older)|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|[Main facilities]<br>Chokseoknu Pavilion, Uiam Rock, Uigisa Pavilion, Imjindaecheop Gyesasunuidan, Statue of General Kim Si-min, Patriotic Bell, Chokseokjeongchungdanbi Monument, Ssangchungsajeokbi Monument, Yeongnam Pojeongsa Pavilion, Gongbukmun Gate, Bukjangdae, Jinju National Museum, Poru, Seojangdae, outdoor stage, Changryeolsa Temple, Hoguksa Temple|\n|Parking Fees:|Small-sized cars: 500 won for first 30-min / 200 won for each additional 10-min<br>Large-sized cars: 1,000 won for the first 30-min / 400 won for each additional-10 min<br>* Free parking fee at the tour bus parking lot of Jinjuseong Fortress|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-21-1671597571410/211697_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-21-1671597571410/211697_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-21-1671597571410/1611507_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-21-1671597571410/1611507_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-21-1671597571410/1611508_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-21-1671597571410/1611508_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-21-1671597571410/1611509_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-21-1671597571410/1611509_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-21-1671597571410/1611510_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-21-1671597571410/1611510_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-21-1671597571410/1951251_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-21-1671597571410/1951251_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-21-1671597571410/211695_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-21-1671597571410/211695_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-21-1671597571410/211698_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-21-1671597571410/211698_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-21-1671597571410/212350_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-21-1671597571410/212350_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-21-1671597571410/2367487_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-21-1671597571410/2367487_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-55-749-5170](tel:+82557495170)\n- [🏠www.jinju.go.kr](http://www.jinju.go.kr/tour.web)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.1897457534\nlongitude: 128.0802763856\ntitle: 626, Namgang-ro, Jinju-si, Gyeongsangnam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>\nFrom  Jinju Intercity Bus Terminal, walk for approx. 10-15 min.\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-21-1671597571410","title":"Jinjuseong Fortress (진주성)","description":"Jinjuseong Fortress, which is historically linked to the Imjin War (1592-1598), was originally named Geoyeolseong Fortress during the Three Kingdom Period, later renamed as Chokseokseong Fortress in the Goryeo dynasty and finally settled as Jinjuseong Fortress in the Joseon dynasty.

The water running through the numerous valleys between these mountains has formed streams like Yongyeoncheon and Sangnicheon, which form the Yangsancheon Stream out of Naewonsagyegok Valley.<br><br>Naewonsagyegok Valley was formerly called Sogeumgang (little Geumgang), meaning that its beautiful scenery is comparable to that of the breathtaking Geumgangsan Mountain. It is also known as the “mystical valley” as crystal clear water flows all year round. The word “Sogeumgang” is distinctly engraved on one side of the cliff and large rocks stand in layers throughout the valley. Some of the rocks are called Byeongpungbawi Rock, literally meaning folding screen rocks, as they are stretched out much like folding screens. <br><br>The valley and the surrounding mountains are a popular summer vacation spot and a well-known hiking destination during the spring, fall, and winter.

The Windbreak Forest in Mulgeon-ri has protected Namhae from gusty winds and ferocious waves and provided abundant fish for 300 years.<br><br>Resembling a crescent moon, the spacious forest (23,438 ㎡) along the seashore is owned by the community of Mulgeon-ri. It stretches over 1.5 kilometers with a x_width of 30 meters; there are over 2,000 trees that create canopies with x_heights varying from 10 to 15 meters. The forest boasts over 100 different species of trees — from hackberries to oaks, zelkovas, fringe trees, muku trees, and silver magnolias. All in all, 10,000 trees create the feeling of being in an ancient forest, deep in the mountains.<br><br>The forest was built by people in nearby villages 300 years ago in order to control winds and waves. From above, elegant curvilinear coastal lines are enveloped by lush trees of the forest, serving as a protection against the Namhae sea. Mulgeon-ri is divided into two areas  the port with a lighthouse, and farmlands, with the forest in between the two. From German Village in Namhae, scenic overlooks provide sweeping views of Mulgeon-ri, the forest, and the port.<br><br>The forest is called a variety of names; it is called Bangpungrim (Windbreak Forest) because it protects villages from gusty winds; Eoburim (Fish shelter Forest) because its lush trees attract schools of fish; and Bangjorim (Waterbreak Forest) because it lessens the severity of waves and tides.<br><br>Home to German Village, Mulgeon-ri faces eastward. Naturally, it is a great spot to see the sunrise and sunset. While Jeongdongjin is renowned for its splendid sunrise on the East Coast, Mulgeon-ri shares the acclaim on the South Coast, attracting thousands of visitors at the dawn of every New Year.","regDate":"2022-12-23","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Eco-Tourism Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-23-1671773763251/2652510_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-23-1671773763251"},{"id":"2022-12-23-1671770382256","title":"Mujidori Village (Muju Farm Village) (무지돌이마을)","description":"Having a 500-year-old history, Mujidori Village is a traditional village with a small stream by the entrance, seven mountain peaks, and three reservoirs.
