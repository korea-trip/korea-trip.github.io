It is also known as the ‚Äúmystical valley‚Äù as crystal clear water flows all year round. The word ‚ÄúSogeumgang‚Äù is distinctly engraved on one side of the cliff and large rocks stand in layers throughout the valley. Some of the rocks are called Byeongpungbawi Rock, literally meaning folding screen rocks, as they are stretched out much like folding screens. <br><br>The valley and the surrounding mountains are a popular summer vacation spot and a well-known hiking destination during the spring, fall, and winter.

From German Village in Namhae, scenic overlooks provide sweeping views of Mulgeon-ri, the forest, and the port.<br><br>The forest is called a variety of names; it is called Bangpungrim (Windbreak Forest) because it protects villages from gusty winds; Eoburim (Fish shelter Forest) because its lush trees attract schools of fish; and Bangjorim (Waterbreak Forest) because it lessens the severity of waves and tides.<br><br>Home to German Village, Mulgeon-ri faces eastward.
