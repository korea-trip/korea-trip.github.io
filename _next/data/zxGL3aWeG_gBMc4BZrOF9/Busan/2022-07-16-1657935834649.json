The average water level is 1~1.5 meters. It is located 3 kilometers from Busan's Jagalchi Market and was one of the first beaches to open in 1913. In 2000, the beach underwent a comprehensive 5-year reconstruction and reopened with restored and expanded coastlines and the addition of several fountains. Nearby attractions include Busan‚Äôs famed Jagalchi Seafood Market and Amnam Park. Amnam Park was a military protected area that opened to the public as a nature park in April 1996. Amnam Park, as well as Dudo Park, a famous sea fishing spot, connects to Songdo, where visitors can see a spectacular landscape with seagulls, a symbol of busan, and the quiet seascape with Yeongdo Island in the distance. \n<br><br>\nThe area has a variety of accommodation and dining options, and is well equipped with convenient facilities such as an overpass, promenade, boat yard, and parking lot. Amnam Park on the Songdo coast is a coastal ecological park. It has an observatory, a 3.8-kilometer promenade, a roadside cafe, and raw fish restaurants with a panoramic view of the Songdo coast and Busan Namhang Port. Another historically important attraction in the area is the Provisional Capital Memorial Hall that was used as the presidential residence for three years when Busan was the temporary capital during the Korean War.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-51-231-0252|\n|parking:|Available (17 lots / 670 spaces)|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Imhae Administration Service Office, accommodations, diving spot, Ocean Leisure and Sports Center, restroom, shower room, changing room, footbath site, etc.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-16-1657935834649/1572107_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-16-1657935834649/1572107_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-16-1657935834649/1572108_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-16-1657935834649/1572108_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-16-1657935834649/1572109_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-16-1657935834649/1572109_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-16-1657935834649/1572110_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-16-1657935834649/1572110_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-16-1657935834649/1572111_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-16-1657935834649/1572111_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-16-1657935834649/1572112_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-16-1657935834649/1572112_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-16-1657935834649/1572113_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-16-1657935834649/1572113_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-16-1657935834649/1572114_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-16-1657935834649/1572114_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-16-1657935834649/2504676_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-16-1657935834649/2504676_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-16-1657935834649/2504677_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-16-1657935834649/2504677_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-51-231-0252](tel:+82512310252)\n- [üè†tour.busan.go.kr](https://www.visitbusan.net/kr/index.do?menuCd=DOM_000000201001001000&uc_seq=286&lang_cd=ko)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.0739256715\nlongitude: 129.0164588470\ntitle: 100, Songdohaebyeon-ro, Seo-gu, Busan\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-16-1657935834649","title":"Busan Songdo Beach (Î∂ÄÏÇ∞ ÏÜ°ÎèÑÌï¥ÏàòÏöïÏû•)","description":"Songdo Beach is 800 meters long and 50 meters wide.
