The palace was expanded in 1902, building Junghwajeon Hall, Junghwamun Gate and Jowonmun Gate in order to  furnish the sytem of law books. After that, the site for Inhwamun Gate became the site for Geongeukmun Gate, and Daehanmun Gate was built to the east of Jowonmun Gate, using it as the main gate. The gate was rebuilt in 1904 and it was currently moved back due to the expanded road.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-2-771-9951|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-22-1658475363609/1994240_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-22-1658475363609/1994240_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-22-1658475363609/2005791_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-22-1658475363609/2005791_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-22-1658475363609/2526937_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-22-1658475363609/2526937_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-22-1658475363609/2526938_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-22-1658475363609/2526938_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-22-1658475363609/2526939_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-22-1658475363609/2526939_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-22-1658475363609/2526940_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-22-1658475363609/2526940_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-22-1658475363609/2526943_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-22-1658475363609/2526943_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-22-1658475363609/2526944_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-22-1658475363609/2526944_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-22-1658475363609/2526945_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-22-1658475363609/2526945_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-22-1658475363609/2526950_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-22-1658475363609/2526950_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-2-771-9951](tel:+8227719951)\n- [üè†www.deoksugung.go.kr](http://www.deoksugung.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5650349403\nlongitude: 126.9764851364\ntitle: 99, Sejong-daero, Jung-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway]<BR>City Hall Station (Seoul Subway Line 1, 2) Exit 2.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-22-1658475363609","title":"Deoksugung Palace's Daehanmun Gate (ÎçïÏàòÍ∂Å ÎåÄÌïúÎ¨∏)","description":"Inhwamun Gate used to be the main gate before the main hall, Junghwajeon Hall, was built.

It is also the main gate of the palace, therefore larger and fancier in comparison to the other gates. Gwanghwamun Gate consists of three arched gates; the center gate was used by the king, while the other two were used by the crown prince and royal officials. The tall granite walls of the gate serve as a platform for the wooden gate tower that watches over the city. The gate has a sign with its name written at the top center of the gate tower. <br><br> Gwanghwamun Gate went through several damages and restorations over the course of history. It was first severely damaged during the Imjin War (1592-1598) and was not restored until the reconstruction of Gyeongbokgung Palace in 1864. Under the Japanese administration, the gate was demolished and relocated to the north of the palace's eastern gate, followed by series of damages during the Korean War (1950-1953). In 1968, Gwanghwamun Gate was relocated back to the south of the palace and was rebuilt using concrete; however, the gate‚Äôs position was shifted a few meters away from its original location. In 2006, a major reconstruction project took place to restore Gwanghwamun Gate to its original state and location, disassembling the structure completely and replacing concrete with granite and wood. After three years and eight months of construction, Gwanghwamun Gate was fully restored to its original form and was open to the public on August 15, 2010.","regDate":"2022-07-23","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Gates"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-23-1658581081718/1075281_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-07-23-1658581081718"},{"id":"2022-07-23-1658575967064","title":"Gwanghuimun Gate (Í¥ëÌù¨Î¨∏)","description":"Gwanghuimun Gate is said to have been originally constructed in 1396, the 5th year of King Taejo, at the southeast of the capital city.

Nevertheless, reconstruction efforts were started in 1711 (37th year of King Sukjong) and the gate was restored together with the gate's watchtower. Gwanghuimun Gate remained intact even when the fortress walls were demolished to build tram tracks during the Japanese occupation, but it was later damaged during the Korean War and left neglected. In 1975, restoration work was carried out to relocate Gwanghuimun Gate to a site 15 meters south of its original location since it stood in the middle of the road.","regDate":"2022-07-23","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Gates"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-23-1658575967064/1568502_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-07-23-1658575967064"}],"navList":["Busan","Daegu","Daejeon","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
