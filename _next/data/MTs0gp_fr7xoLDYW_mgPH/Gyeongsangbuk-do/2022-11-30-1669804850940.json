There are two, three-storied stone pagodas in the heart of Namsan Village and a small, elegant pond to the east. The pond is famous thanks to a Korean legend, written below <br><br>In the 10th year of King Soji (488) of Silla, a crow and a mouse approached the king as he was on his way to Namsan Mountain. The mouse told the King to ‚Äúfollow after the crow‚Äù for an easy journey. So, the King and his servant (who was traveling with him) followed the crow, but became distracted and lost their way. As they were wandering about a pond (now known as Seochulji), an old man appeared from the waters‚Äô depths and presented an envelope to the King. Based on the message in the envelope, the King instructed his servant to fire an arrow at the Geomungo (Korean musical instrument) case nearby. The shot killed the queen and a monk who had been hiding there, both of whom had been hatching a plot against the King. <br><br>The name of the pond, ‚ÄúSeochulji‚Äù (literally meaning ‚Äúwriting from the pond‚Äù) originates from this legend. It is said that a man named Imjeok built a building by the pond in the 5th year of King Hyeonjong (1664) to enjoy the scenery. The simple, yet elegant building still remains at the northwest of the pond.","regDate":"2022-12-05","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Eco-Tourism Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-05-1670215268816/214720_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-05-1670215268816"},{"id":"2022-12-05-1670211454452","title":"Seobyeok Historic House (ÏÑúÎ≤ΩÍ≥†ÌÉù)","description":"Located in Jungpyeong-dong at the family village of the Pyeongsan Sin clan, the Seobyeok Historic House was originally created when Sin Hanchang, a scholar from late Joseon dynasty, got married and moved out of his parents‚Äô house.
