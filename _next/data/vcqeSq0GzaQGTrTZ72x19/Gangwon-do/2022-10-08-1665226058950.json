Over a period of 80 years, the settlers had led their religious lives without a priest until Father Le Merre (a French priest) came to the village in 1888. Succeeding Le Merre in 1896, Father Jeong Gyu-ha (or Augustino), along with Chinese engineers, began to build Pungsuwon Cathedral.<br><br>Completed in 1907 by the faithful, the cathedral still remains a beautiful building even after 110 years; it is a popular spot for visitors, having frequently appeared in Korean dramas and films such as “Love Letter (1995 MBC miniseries).” It is the first cathedral built by a Korean priest as well as in Gangwon-do; it is the fourth cathedral built in Korea. Pungsuwon Cathedral was designated as Gangwon-do Local Cultural Property No.69 in 1982.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-33-342-0035|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Film Locations:|Various dramas|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Not available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-10-08-1665226058950/1583972_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-08-1665226058950/1583972_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-08-1665226058950/1583974_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-08-1665226058950/1583974_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-08-1665226058950/1583975_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-08-1665226058950/1583975_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-08-1665226058950/2480279_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-08-1665226058950/2480279_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-08-1665226058950/2480280_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-08-1665226058950/2480280_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-08-1665226058950/2480281_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-08-1665226058950/2480281_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-08-1665226058950/2480283_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-08-1665226058950/2480283_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-08-1665226058950/2480284_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-08-1665226058950/2480284_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-08-1665226058950/1583973_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-08-1665226058950/1583973_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-08-1665226058950/1583976_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-08-1665226058950/1583976_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-33-342-0035](tel:+82333420035)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5292128056\nlongitude: 127.8186624439\ntitle: 30, Gyeonggang-ro yuhyeon 1-gil, Seowon-myeon, Hoengseong-gun, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Seoul Sangbong Bus Terminal, take an intercity \nbus to Hoengseong Bus Terminal.<br>From Hoengseong Bus Terminal, take a bus bound for Pungsuwon.\n","data":{"id":"2022-10-08-1665226058950","title":"Pungsuwon Catholic Church (횡성 풍수원천주교회(풍수원성당))","description":"Pungsuwon was the first catholic village in which over 40 faithful from Yongin (Gyeonggi-do), led by Sin Tae-bo (or St. Peter), settled to escape the wrath of Sinyubakhae (religious persecution of Catholics) of 1801.
