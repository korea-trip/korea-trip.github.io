Guryong means nine dragons and legend has it that each of the waterfalls was occupied by a dragon. The sixth waterfall is particularly attractive. It is simultaneously the most magnificent and serene of the falls, which is why it is also known as the Gentleman’s Waterfall. Two kilometers away from the sixth waterfall, is a curious-looking piece of rock called Manmulsang. The name literally means tens of thousands of different looks. Some of these looks have earned it to other names such as Giant Rock, Phantom-Face Rock, Iworam, and Candlestick Rock’\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Korea Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-33-332-6417|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Mountain Not Access Period:|Seasonal Forest Fire Prevention Period<br>Feb 1 – May 15, Nov 15 – Dec <br><br>*Schedule subject to change by park ranger orders, based on fire weather advisories, snow/precipitation levels, and other local conditions.
