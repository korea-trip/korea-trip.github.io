Its original name was Dongnae Mountain Fortress, but it was changed because of its location.   \n<br>\n<br>\nWith a length of 17,377 meters and x_height of 1.5 to 3 meters high, it was the largest fortress in Korea. Currently, there is only a 4 kilometer long section remaining from the original form. The exact time of the initial fortification is not recorded, but in reference to the location and size, it is presumed to have been built during the Three Kingdoms Era.The present fortress was built in 1703, during the reign of King Sukjong. It was built after the Imjin War (1592-1598) to prepare for any further invasions. It was first built with stones and was renovated in 1707.  During the Japanese Colonization, it was severely damaged.
