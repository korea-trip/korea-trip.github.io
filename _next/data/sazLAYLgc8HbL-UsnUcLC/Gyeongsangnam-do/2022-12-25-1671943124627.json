Sinseon in Korean means supernatural beings; the beauty of this spot is said to attract such beings to come frolic. The blue and yellow colors layered on the rocks tell a unique history of the terrain. A stairway from the road leads directly to the lookout point. <br />Just past a gas station along the coastal highway, Sinseondae Observatory reveals itself. Walking out onto the rocks of Sinseondae, views of the surrounding islands and incredible landscape open up to viewers. Many commercials and TV shows have been filmed here taking advantage of this amazing setting. April and May are the perfect times to see the bright-yellow canola flowers across the island.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-55-639-3000|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Film Locations:|Drama \"Merry Go Round (2003),\" movies \"The Big Swindle (2004)\" & \"The Windmill Palm Grove (2005)\"|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-25-1671943124627/212107_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-25-1671943124627/212107_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-25-1671943124627/212109_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-25-1671943124627/212109_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-25-1671943124627/212110_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-25-1671943124627/212110_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-25-1671943124627/212111_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-25-1671943124627/212111_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-25-1671943124627/749606_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-25-1671943124627/749606_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-25-1671943124627/749608_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-25-1671943124627/749608_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-25-1671943124627/749611_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-25-1671943124627/749611_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-25-1671943124627/749616_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-25-1671943124627/749616_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-25-1671943124627/749618_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-25-1671943124627/749618_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-25-1671943124627/1999739_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-25-1671943124627/1999739_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-55-639-3000](tel:+82556393000)\n- [üè†tour.geoje.go.kr](http://tour.geoje.go.kr/index.sko)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 34.7373624372\nlongitude: 128.6648928581\ntitle: San 21-19, Galgot-ri, Nambu-myeon, Geoje-si, Gyeongsangnam-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-25-1671943124627","title":"Sinseondae Observatory (Ïã†ÏÑ†ÎåÄ Ï†ÑÎßùÎåÄ)","description":"Sinseondae Observatory, located between Dojangpo Maeul and Haegeumgang, offers picturesque views of the fantastically shaped rocks against the deep-blue ocean hues.

The footprints are deeply imprinted in the wide sheets of rocks arrayed along Dongdaeman Beach. Researchers believe that these enormous footprints belong to a species of huge pterosaur, and visitors can see about 60 smaller footprints that are believed to belong to early humans. The dinosaur footprints and other cretaceous fossils are located along the cape by the shore, so you must time your visit well to see them. According to paleontologists, the footprints are the evidence of three specimens of herbivorous  sauropoda, which walked on two 60 centimeter-long feet; two specimens of ornithopoda, which were also herbivores, that had three toes on each foot; and one specimen of another ornithopod species, a carnivore that had sharp claws and walked on two feet. The layout of the footprints alludes to a situation where the herbivores were walking in a group followed by a carnivore preparing for an attack! <br><br>","regDate":"2022-12-27","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Eco-Tourism Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-27-1672133762383/212944_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-27-1672133762383"},{"id":"2022-12-27-1672130246490","title":"DPIRANG (ÎîîÌîºÎûë)","description":"DPIRANG is a digital nighttime theme park in Nammangsan Park that consists of 15 walking paths decorated with lights.
