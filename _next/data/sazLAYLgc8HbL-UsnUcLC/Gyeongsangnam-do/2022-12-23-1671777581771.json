The valley is surrounded by Jeongjoksan Mountain to the northeast, Wonjeoksan Mountain to the south, and Cheonseongsan Mountain to the southeast. The water running through the numerous valleys between these mountains has formed streams like Yongyeoncheon and Sangnicheon, which form the Yangsancheon Stream out of Naewonsagyegok Valley.<br><br>Naewonsagyegok Valley was formerly called Sogeumgang (little Geumgang), meaning that its beautiful scenery is comparable to that of the breathtaking Geumgangsan Mountain. It is also known as the ‚Äúmystical valley‚Äù as crystal clear water flows all year round. The word ‚ÄúSogeumgang‚Äù is distinctly engraved on one side of the cliff and large rocks stand in layers throughout the valley. Some of the rocks are called Byeongpungbawi Rock, literally meaning folding screen rocks, as they are stretched out much like folding screens. <br><br>The valley and the surrounding mountains are a popular summer vacation spot and a well-known hiking destination during the spring, fall, and winter. Muk (acorn jelly) made with acorns gathered from this area not only tastes great, but is also very healthy. Nearby attractions include Tongdosa Temple and Hongnyongpokpo Falls.<br><br>* Entrance into the upper region of Naewonsagyegok Valley is restricted.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-55-380-4826|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Adults - 2,000 won|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-23-1671777581771/1228101_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-23-1671777581771/1228101_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-23-1671777581771/1228111_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-23-1671777581771/1228111_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-23-1671777581771/1228112_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-23-1671777581771/1228112_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-23-1671777581771/1228117_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-23-1671777581771/1228117_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-23-1671777581771/1228127_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-23-1671777581771/1228127_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-23-1671777581771/1228135_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-23-1671777581771/1228135_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-55-380-4826](tel:+82553804826)\n- [üè†www.yangsan.go.kr](http://www.yangsan.go.kr/tour)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.4243519049\nlongitude: 129.1047970740\ntitle: 207, Naewon-ro, Yangsan-si, Gyeongsangnam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Taxi]<br>\nApprox. 30 min from Yangsan Intercity Bus Terminal.\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-23-1671777581771","title":"Naewonsagyegok Valley (ÎÇ¥ÏõêÏÇ¨Í≥ÑÍ≥°)","description":"Naewonsagyegok Valley is located just below Naewonsa Temple at the foot of Cheonseongsan Mountain.

The footprints are deeply imprinted in the wide sheets of rocks arrayed along Dongdaeman Beach. Researchers believe that these enormous footprints belong to a species of huge pterosaur, and visitors can see about 60 smaller footprints that are believed to belong to early humans. The dinosaur footprints and other cretaceous fossils are located along the cape by the shore, so you must time your visit well to see them. According to paleontologists, the footprints are the evidence of three specimens of herbivorous  sauropoda, which walked on two 60 centimeter-long feet; two specimens of ornithopoda, which were also herbivores, that had three toes on each foot; and one specimen of another ornithopod species, a carnivore that had sharp claws and walked on two feet. The layout of the footprints alludes to a situation where the herbivores were walking in a group followed by a carnivore preparing for an attack! <br><br>","regDate":"2022-12-27","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Eco-Tourism Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-27-1672133762383/212944_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-27-1672133762383"},{"id":"2022-12-27-1672130246490","title":"DPIRANG (ÎîîÌîºÎûë)","description":"DPIRANG is a digital nighttime theme park in Nammangsan Park that consists of 15 walking paths decorated with lights.
