This valley is Baegundonggyegok Valley.  For almost 6 km, the water of the valley flows over only rocks, with over twenty large and small falls and lakes.  Large stones in the valley are gorgeous because the stones are washed with sunbeams and the strong current of water.  The most famous falls are Baeunpokpo Waterfall and Odampokpo Waterfall.  Strong current of water flows in Deungcheondae, where the letters ‚ÄòYeongnamjeilcheonsok‚Äô are carved.  Baegundonggyegok Valley is a clean area due to maintenance of the clean natural environment.  Many tourists visit here because the valley is decorated with azaleas in the spring and it is cool in the summer.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-55-970-6421~3|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-30-1659159589087/1889976_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659159589087/1889976_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659159589087/1889977_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659159589087/1889977_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659159589087/1889980_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659159589087/1889980_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-55-970-6421~3](tel:+82559706421~3)\n- [üè†www.sancheong.go.kr](http://www.sancheong.go.kr/tour/index.do)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.2963413776\nlongitude: 127.8835964068\ntitle: Baegun-ro 51beon-gil, Danseong-myeon, Sancheong-gun, Gyeongsangnam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \nFrom Seoul Nambu Bus Terminal, take an intercity bus  to Sancheong Intercity Bus Terminal.Take a taxi for approx. 30 min. to the valley.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-30-1659159589087","title":"Baegundonggyegok Valley, Sancheong (Î∞±Ïö¥ÎèôÍ≥ÑÍ≥°(ÏÇ∞Ï≤≠))","description":"If you go 5 km up along the valley at Baegam-ri, under the thick woods, you will find a 180 square meter long stone named ‚ÄòJeomjeong Rock‚Äô and a small waterfall.

The footprints are deeply imprinted in the wide sheets of rocks arrayed along Dongdaeman Beach. Researchers believe that these enormous footprints belong to a species of huge pterosaur, and visitors can see about 60 smaller footprints that are believed to belong to early humans. The dinosaur footprints and other cretaceous fossils are located along the cape by the shore, so you must time your visit well to see them. According to paleontologists, the footprints are the evidence of three specimens of herbivorous  sauropoda, which walked on two 60 centimeter-long feet; two specimens of ornithopoda, which were also herbivores, that had three toes on each foot; and one specimen of another ornithopod species, a carnivore that had sharp claws and walked on two feet. The layout of the footprints alludes to a situation where the herbivores were walking in a group followed by a carnivore preparing for an attack! <br><br>","regDate":"2022-12-27","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Eco-Tourism Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-27-1672133762383/212944_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-12-27-1672133762383"},{"id":"2022-12-27-1672130246490","title":"DPIRANG (ÎîîÌîºÎûë)","description":"DPIRANG is a digital nighttime theme park in Nammangsan Park that consists of 15 walking paths decorated with lights.
