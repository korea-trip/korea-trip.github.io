The surrounding pine forest is lush and beautiful. In particular, there is a fishing spot with a large rock formation in front of the beach. For one to two days each month, there is a phenomenon also know as Moses Miracle that opens a 1.5-kilometer-long road in the sea. This mysterious sea road was thought to only appear during summer, however it was revealed that it actually occurs every lunar month. In 1996, the beach was open to the general public. <br><br> The red lighthouse towering at the end of the long breakwater is as impressive as a picture. The pretty pensions right in front of the sandy beach add to the scenery.
