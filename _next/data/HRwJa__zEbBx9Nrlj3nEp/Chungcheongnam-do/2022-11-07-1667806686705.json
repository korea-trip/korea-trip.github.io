The ferry passes various historical sites within Busosanseong Fortress, including Cheonjangdae Cliff, Nakhwaam Rock, Joryongdae Cliff, and Jaondae Cliff. Of these sites, Nakhwaam Rock (Falling Flower Rock) is perhaps the most famous, being known as the location where many Baekje women jumped from the cliff rather than be taken captive when the dynasty fell to invading forces. Another key site is Goransa Temple, home to a fountain of natural spring water that was said to prevent aging.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-41-835-4689,<br>+82-41-835-4690|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round; excluding temporary closure due to flooding)|\n|usetime:|[General Ferry] Depart when at least 7 adults have boarded<br>[Traditional Sailboat] Depart when at least 30 adults have boarded|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|[Gudeurae-Goransa]<br />Round-trip - Adults 7,000 won / Children 3,500 won<br />One-way - Adults 5,000 won / Children 2,500 won<br /><br>[Tradittional Sailboat  (round-trip)]<br />13,000 won<br /><br>[Gudeurae-Cheonjeongdae-Goransa (round-trip)]<br />Adults 13,000 won / Children 6,500 won<br /><br>[Gudeurae-Cheonjeongdae-Goransa (one-way)]<br />Adults 10,000 won / Children 5,000 won<br /><br>* Admission to Busosanseong Fortress charged separately|\n|Reservation Info. for Natives:|Phone reservation accepted for Traditional Sailboat|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-07-1667806686705/1601189_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-07-1667806686705/1601189_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-07-1667806686705/1601191_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-07-1667806686705/1601191_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-07-1667806686705/1601192_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-07-1667806686705/1601192_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-07-1667806686705/1601193_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-07-1667806686705/1601193_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-07-1667806686705/1601194_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-07-1667806686705/1601194_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-41-835-4689](tel:+82418354689)\n- [üè†tour.buyeo.go.kr](http://tour.buyeo.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.2921557103\nlongitude: 126.9152116634\ntitle: Buso-ro, Buyeo-gun, Chungcheongnam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nTake an intercity bus from Seoul Nambu Terminal to Buyeo Intercity Bus Terminal.<br>\n- Take a taxi to Busosanseong Fortress (5min).<br>\n- Follow the directions inside the fortress to reach Goransa Temple.<br>\n- The ferry dock is at the riverside.\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-07-1667806686705","title":"Goransa Ferry (Í≥†ÎûÄÏÇ¨Ïú†ÎûåÏÑ†)","description":"Goransa Ferry is the best way to understand the history of the Baekje dynasty while enjoying the still waters of Baengmagang River.
