Prior to the establishment of Gyeongin Railroad, this alley was Incheon’s representative road to Seoul, referred to as Ugakli Street. During the 60s and 70s when living was difficult and everything was hard to get one's hands on, it was the only secondhand bookstore alley in the Incheon area where people could quench their thirst for learning. Known as the Baedari Bookstore Alley, there are about 10 bookstores altogether within the area that sell secondhand books and new books. Countless books in a wide range of topics from ancient Korean literature, arts, music, medicine, children’s books, dictionaries and more fill up the small but charming bookstores. Artworks that depict the old lifestyles of residents at Baedari decorate the alley walls, offering more to see.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-32-770-6100|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-11-1657543591392/2030737_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-11-1657543591392/2030737_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-11-1657543591392/2476148_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-11-1657543591392/2476148_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-11-1657543591392/2476154_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-11-1657543591392/2476154_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-11-1657543591392/2476165_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-11-1657543591392/2476165_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-32-766-9523](tel:+82327669523)\n- [🏠www.icdonggu.go.kr](http://www.icdonggu.go.kr/open_content/culture/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.4724368725\nlongitude: 126.6362715334\ntitle: 6, Geumgok-ro, Dong-gu, Incheon\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Dong Incheon Station.<br>\nBus No. 9, 10, 15, 27, 28<br>\nBound for Baedari<br><br>\n\nFrom Dowon Station.<br>\nBus No. 9, 10, 15, 27, 28<br>\nBound for Baedari\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-11-1657543591392","title":"Baedari Secondhand Bookstore Alley (배다리 헌책방 골목)","description":"Baedari Secondhand Bookstore Alley is located in the boundary between Geumgok-dong and Changyeong-dong in Dong-gu, Incheon.

The street became connected samchi, or grilled seerfish, over 40 years ago with the opening House of Inha, a home-style restaurant. Originally, the street was not known for samchi, but it became one of the most popular menus at the restuarant, with many other shops in the area following in this trend. In 2002, it was designated as the grilled seerfish street and a signboard was put up at the street entrance. Currently, there are about a dozen grilled seerfish restaurants lining the street, and each restaurant has a unique signboard of its own. The fish are imported from New Zealand, and each restaurant offers a distinct taste resulting from different grilling methods and sauces. The restaurants also sell a variety of appetizers and side dishes at affordable prices.","regDate":"2022-07-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Culture/Art/History","Experience Programs","Cultural Districts"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-12-1657605089652/728361_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-07-12-1657605089652"},{"id":"2022-07-12-1657600897567","title":"Dolmen in Bugeun-ri [UNESCO World Heritage] (강화 고인돌 유적 [유네스코 세계문화유산])","description":"Dolmen in Bugeun-ri is a dolmen site in Ganghwa that is designated as Historic Site No. 137 for its historical value representing the funeral customs of the Bronze Age.
