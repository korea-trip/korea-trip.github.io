The mountain is named after its appearance that resembles  Buddha wearing songnak (headgear) and is also referred to as Cheonbosan or Piramsan Mountain. The ridge stretches long enough to enjoy the scenery and it's an easy hike because it is not too steep. In particular, the stunning view of Seoul at night unfolds at the top of the mountain.<br>\nBuramsanseong Fortress is located 420 meters above sea level and the rock cliffs are often used as rock climbing spots. There are also various hiking trails and about ten springs to get fresh mineral water. Burampokpo Falls is popular in winter among ice climbing enthusiasts.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-2-2116-3943|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Mountain Not Access Period:|Seasonal Forest Fire Watches<br>Spring: March 2 - April 30 <br>Autumn: November 1 - December 15<brNational Park: November 15 - December 15 (Excluding Gyeongju and Taean)<br>* Periods and areas are subject to change based on fire weather advisories, snow/precipitation levels, and other local conditions.|\n|Restricted Mountain Areas :|[Refer to the website.](http://hiking.kworks.co.kr/sub_map/map_user01.aspx)|\n|Hiking Course:|3.1 Kilo course: Park office - Cheongam Spring Entrance - Doldabang rest area - Neungseon fourway - peak<br>3.2 Kilo course: Park office - Jeongamsa Temple - Buram sports field - Ggalddakgogae Hill - peak<br>3.8 Kilo course: Yangji guard post - Cheonbyeong spring - heliport - Ggalddakgogae Hill - peak<br>5.8 Kilo course: Korea Cancer Center Hospital back entrance - Sahmyook University crossroad - Hakdoam crossroad - heliport - peak|\n|Available Facilities:|Mineral springs, restaurants, shops, etc.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-21-1658382231452/2462056_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658382231452/2462056_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658382231452/2462057_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658382231452/2462057_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658382231452/2462058_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658382231452/2462058_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658382231452/2462059_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658382231452/2462059_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658382231452/2462060_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658382231452/2462060_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658382231452/2462061_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658382231452/2462061_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658382231452/2462062_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658382231452/2462062_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658382231452/2462063_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658382231452/2462063_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658382231452/2462064_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658382231452/2462064_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658382231452/2462065_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658382231452/2462065_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-2-2116-3943](tel:+82221163943)\n- [üè†www.nowon.kr](https://www.nowon.kr/www/info/info1/info1_02.jsp)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.6725633390\nlongitude: 127.0882468880\ntitle: 22, Deongneung-ro 130ga-gil, Nowon-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-21-1658382231452","title":"Buramsan Mountain (Î∂àÏïîÏÇ∞)","description":"Buramsan Mountain is an 508-meter high rock mountain, drawing the border between Junggye-dong and Sanggye-dong in Nowon-gu and Byeolnae-myeon in Namyangju.

It is also the main gate of the palace, therefore larger and fancier in comparison to the other gates. Gwanghwamun Gate consists of three arched gates; the center gate was used by the king, while the other two were used by the crown prince and royal officials. The tall granite walls of the gate serve as a platform for the wooden gate tower that watches over the city. The gate has a sign with its name written at the top center of the gate tower. <br><br> Gwanghwamun Gate went through several damages and restorations over the course of history. It was first severely damaged during the Imjin War (1592-1598) and was not restored until the reconstruction of Gyeongbokgung Palace in 1864. Under the Japanese administration, the gate was demolished and relocated to the north of the palace's eastern gate, followed by series of damages during the Korean War (1950-1953). In 1968, Gwanghwamun Gate was relocated back to the south of the palace and was rebuilt using concrete; however, the gate‚Äôs position was shifted a few meters away from its original location. In 2006, a major reconstruction project took place to restore Gwanghwamun Gate to its original state and location, disassembling the structure completely and replacing concrete with granite and wood. After three years and eight months of construction, Gwanghwamun Gate was fully restored to its original form and was open to the public on August 15, 2010.","regDate":"2022-07-23","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Gates"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-23-1658581081718/1075281_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-07-23-1658581081718"},{"id":"2022-07-23-1658575967064","title":"Gwanghuimun Gate (Í¥ëÌù¨Î¨∏)","description":"Gwanghuimun Gate is said to have been originally constructed in 1396, the 5th year of King Taejo, at the southeast of the capital city.

Nevertheless, reconstruction efforts were started in 1711 (37th year of King Sukjong) and the gate was restored together with the gate's watchtower. Gwanghuimun Gate remained intact even when the fortress walls were demolished to build tram tracks during the Japanese occupation, but it was later damaged during the Korean War and left neglected. In 1975, restoration work was carried out to relocate Gwanghuimun Gate to a site 15 meters south of its original location since it stood in the middle of the road.","regDate":"2022-07-23","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Gates"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-23-1658575967064/1568502_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-07-23-1658575967064"},{"id":"2022-07-23-1658572742393","title":"Gwanaksan Mountain Nakseongdae Park (Í¥ÄÏïÖÏÇ∞ ÎÇôÏÑ±ÎåÄÍ≥µÏõê)","description":"Nakseongdae Park was built as a tribute to General Kang Gam-chan (948-1031) of the Goryeo dynasty.
