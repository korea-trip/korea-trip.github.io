It is the most famous place for fall colors in Seoraksan Mountain, and its handsome valley and rock formations are well-known as well. Its name, Jujeongol, is said to come from the Joseon-era bandits that are said to have settled in the area, making their living with counterfeit (ju) coins (jeon) while disguised as Buddhist monks. Osaek (meaning ‚Äúfive colors‚Äù) was inspired by the five colors of Jujeongol‚Äôs rock formations, and the five-colored tree that is said to have lived in Osaekseoksa Temple of the past. A 3.2 km-long trail brings visitors along the rising rocks next to the valley, connecting Seongguksa Temple and Seonnyeotang Pothole to Yongso Falls Information Center. It is a relatively flat, 1 hr-long course with many wooden decks that help to make it more accessible for the visitors. The entrance to the trail is the location of the Osaek Mineral Spring, whose natural carbonation and iron content impart a unique flavor in the water. Keep your eyes open for strange rock formations like Gorae, Sangtu, and Bubu Rocks, as well as Namseorak‚Äôs famous sights like Seonnyeotang Pothole, Geumgangmun Gate, and Yongso Falls.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-33-672-2883|\n|parking:|Available (Seorak Section C1, C2, B1, B2, A)|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Summer season (March‚ÄìOctober) 03:00‚Äì17:30 / Winter season (November‚ÄìFebruary) 04:00‚Äì17:30, Entrance to certain areas may be controlled depending on weather conditions|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Activity Fees:|Free of charge|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Free of charge|\n|Available Facilities:|Osaek Jujeongol Nature Observation Trail, Osaek Yaksu Wild Vegetable Restaurant Village|\n|Reservation Info. for Foreigners:|+82-33-801-0900 (Seoraksan National Park Management Office, reservation for use of mountain shelters)|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|None|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-10-07-1665140056405/1955858_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-07-1665140056405/1955858_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-07-1665140056405/2365192_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-07-1665140056405/2365192_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-07-1665140056405/2365195_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-07-1665140056405/2365195_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-07-1665140056405/2365304_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-07-1665140056405/2365304_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-07-1665140056405/1955861_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-07-1665140056405/1955861_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-07-1665140056405/1955864_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-07-1665140056405/1955864_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-07-1665140056405/2365193_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-07-1665140056405/2365193_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-33-672-2883](tel:+82336722883)\n- [üè†seorak.knps.or.kr](http://seorak.knps.or.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 38.0765110456\nlongitude: 128.4400229902\ntitle: Yaksu-gil, Yangyang-gun, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Dong Seoul Bus Terminal, take an intercity bus to Osaek Bus Termianl.\n","data":{"id":"2022-10-07-1665140056405","title":"Osaek Jujeongol Valley (Ïò§ÏÉâÏ£ºÏ†ÑÍ≥®)","description":"This valley in Seoraksan National Park is located on the way from Osaek-ri, Yangyang-gun, to Osaengnyeong (Hangyeryeong) Pass.
