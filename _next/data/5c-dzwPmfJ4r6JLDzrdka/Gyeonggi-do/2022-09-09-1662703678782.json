Hwaseong Haenggung Palace is the largest one of these, used by the Joseon kings since the time of King Jeongjo (r. 1776-1800). In addition to being used as a shelter during war, King Jeongjo also stayed here during trips to worship at his father's tomb. The palace was the location of a splendid feast held on the 60th birthday of his mother, Hyegyeonggung Hong, and many other events, including award certificates for successful candidates of special national exams. These days, the palace serves as a venue for many traditional cultural performances and activities.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-31-228-4677, 4480|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Film Locations:|Dramas - \"Moon Embracing the Sun (2012),\" \"Rooftop Prince (2012),\" \"Deep Rooted Tree (2011),\" \"The Princess' Man (2011),\" \"Lee San, Wind of the Palace (2007),\" \"Insu, The Queen Mother (2011),\" \"Queen and I (2012),\" \"The King and I (2007)\"<br />Film - \"Masquerade (2012)\"|\n|Parking Fees:|One-time parking (3 hour basis) - Small vehicles 2,000 won / Large vehicles 4,000 won<br />* 200 won charged for each additional 10 min<br>One-day parking (max charge) - Small vehicles 10,000 won / Large vehicles 15,000 won|\n|Admission Fees:|Individual - Adults 1,500 won / Teenagers 1,000 won / Children 700 won<br>Group - Adults 1,200 won / Teenagers 800 won / Children 500 won<br><br>* Group: 20 people or more.<br>* Free (Proper ID required): Preschoolers (ages 6 and younger) & senior citizens (ages 65 and older)<br>* For groups of students (20 or more), 1 accompanying staff or guardian can enter free.|\n|Available Facilities:|* Sinpungnu Pavilion, Bukgunyeong, Namgunyeong, Jipsacheong, Seoricheong, Bijangcheong, Jwaikmun Gate, Jungangmun Gate, Yuyeotaek, Boknaedang, Gyeongnyonggwan, Bongsudang, Jangnakdang, Mirohanjeong, Naknamheon, etc.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Guided tour in English, Japanese (Reservation required)<br>Audio guide rental|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-09-09-1662703678782/1589536_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-09-1662703678782/1589536_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-09-1662703678782/1589537_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-09-1662703678782/1589537_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-09-1662703678782/1589538_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-09-1662703678782/1589538_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-09-1662703678782/1589539_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-09-1662703678782/1589539_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-09-1662703678782/1589540_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-09-1662703678782/1589540_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-09-1662703678782/1589542_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-09-1662703678782/1589542_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-09-1662703678782/1999721_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-09-1662703678782/1999721_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-09-1662703678782/2365496_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-09-1662703678782/2365496_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-09-1662703678782/2657615_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-09-1662703678782/2657615_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-09-1662703678782/1589541_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-09-1662703678782/1589541_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-31-228-4677](tel:+82312284677)\n- [üè†www.swcf.or.kr](http://www.swcf.or.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.2819295766\nlongitude: 127.0144035414\ntitle: 825, Jeongjo-ro, Paldal-gu, Suwon-si, Gyeonggi-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Suwon Station Bus Stop, take Bus No. 11 or 13 and get off at Hwaseong Haenggung Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-09-09-1662703678782","title":"Temporary Palace at Hwaseong Fortress (Hwaseong Haenggung Palace) (ÌôîÏÑ±ÌñâÍ∂Å)","description":"A <em>haenggung</em> is a temporary palace where the king and royal family retreated to during a war.
