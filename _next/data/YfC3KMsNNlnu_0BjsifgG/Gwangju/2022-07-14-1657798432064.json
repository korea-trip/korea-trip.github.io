The Jusangjeolli cliffs of Mudeungsan Mountain consist of Seoseokdae, Ipseokdae, and Gyubong Rocks formed about 70 million years ago. Ipseokdae and Gyubong Rocks are both of a distinct pillar shape as they have been heavily weathered, and Seoseokdae, which was less weathered, looks like a folding screen. The Neodeolgeong (cluster of rocks), which sit on the mountain slope, were made when stone pillars collapsed. The standing rocks and Neodolgeong have been designated as Natural Monuments due to their rarity and uniqueness.","regDate":"2022-07-14","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gwangju","Nature","Natural Resources","Rocks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-14-1657804476552/1558947_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gwangju/2022-07-14-1657804476552"},{"id":"2022-07-14-1657795264384","title":"Jeonpyeongje Reservoir (Ï†ÑÌèâÏ†ú)","description":"Jeonpyeongje Reservoir was built in 1943 to supply water for agricultural purposes to farms in the Maewol-dong and Byeokjin-dong regions as well as to prevent both floods and droughts.
