Jeoksangsan, also called Red Skirt Mountain, got its name from the view of red maple trees around cliffs in fall that makes the mountain look like a giant red skirt. The mountain boasts a variety of attractions from Hyangnobong Peak (1,029 meters), Cheonilpokpo Falls, Songdaepokpo Falls, Jangdobawi Rock, Janggunbawi Rock, and Allyeomdae Cliff.<br><br>The rugged shape of the mountain was considered ideal for building a fortress. And after Jeoksangsan became a designated site for storing Joseonwangjo Sillok (annals of the Joseon Dynasty), the fortress surrounding it was further rebuilt. The mountain is also home to Anguksa Temple, an ancient temple built in 1227 (during the 3rd year of King Chungryeol‚Äôs reign) by Monk Wolin. The mountain can easily be climbed by hiking or by vehicle; there is a paved road stretching over 15 kilometers that leads to the top of the mountain thanks to the construction of Muju Power Plant, letting tourists visit Sanjeong Lake and Anguksa Temple conveniently.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-63-322-4174|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Mountain Not Access Period:|Seasonal Forest Fire Watches<br>Spring: March 2-April 30 <br>Autumn: November 1-December 15<brNational Park: November 15-December 15 (Excluding Gyeongju and Taean)<br>* Periods and areas are subject to change based on fire weather advisories, snow/precipitation levels, and other local conditions.|\n|Hiking Course:|Seochang Course (2 hours / 3.8 km): Seochang Park Office ‚Äì Three-way intersection ‚Äì Anguksa Temple<br>Chimok Course (2 hours / 3.7 km): Chimok ‚Äì Songdaepokpo Falls ‚Äì Anguksa Temple|\n|Restricted Mountain Areas :|Chimok ‚Äì Anguksa Temple (3.7 km)<br>Inwoldam ‚Äì Seolcheonbong Peak (5.1 km)<br>Hyangjeokbong Peak ‚Äì Yeonggak Park Ranger Office (17.5 km)<br>Baengyeonsa Temple ‚Äì Jungbong Peak (4.0 km)<br>Hoenggyeongjae Pass ‚Äì Sinpungnyeong Pass (7.8 km)<br>Songgyesa Temple ‚Äì Baegambong Peak (6.5 km)<br>Anseong Visitor Center ‚Äì Dongyeopryeong Pass (4.4 km)<br>Hoengjeom ‚Äì Weolseongjae Pass (2.6 km)<br>Yuksimnyeong Pass ‚Äì Namdeokyusan Mountain (3.6 km)<br>Byeonggok ‚Äì Dongyeomnyeong Pass (3.5 km)<br>Yangak ‚Äì Weolseongjae Pass (4.0 km)<br>Anguksan Mountain ‚Äì Nammunji (0.8 km)<br><br>[Summer Valley Closure Restricted Areas]<br>- Je2 Inweolgyo Bridge ‚Äì Baengnyeongsdam area<br>- Susimdae ‚Äì Pahoe ‚Äì Manjotan area<br>- Suseongdae area<br>- Hakseogyo Bridge ‚Äì Chilyeongyegok Valley area|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-03-1672742201681/1196420_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-03-1672742201681/1196420_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-03-1672742201681/1248420_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-03-1672742201681/1248420_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-03-1672742201681/1248429_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-03-1672742201681/1248429_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-03-1672742201681/1248431_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-03-1672742201681/1248431_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-03-1672742201681/2719975_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-03-1672742201681/2719975_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-03-1672742201681/2719976_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-03-1672742201681/2719976_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-03-1672742201681/2719977_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-03-1672742201681/2719977_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-63-322-4174](tel:+82633224174)\n- [üè†deogyu.knps.or.kr](http://deogyu.knps.or.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.9425120499\nlongitude: 127.6919628124\ntitle: Goemok-ri, Muju-gun, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-03-1672742201681","title":"Jeoksangsan Mountain (Ï†ÅÏÉÅÏÇ∞)","description":"As one of the best scenic mountains in Korea, Jeoksangsan Mountain (1,030.6 meters) showcases imposing, steep rock walls.
