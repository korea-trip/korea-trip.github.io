Compared with other Korean fortresses, Imjonseong Fortress is higher and about 2 meters thicker. It is the largest fortress of the Baekje Kingdom and has become the subject of much research.<br><br>History shows that the fortress was the central hub of the Restoration Movement of the Baekje Kingdom (18 BC - 660 AD). In the 20th year of the reign of King Uija (Baekje dynasty), the kingdom was defeated by the united forces of the Silla Kingdom and the Tang dynasty (currently, China).

Traces of Munsusa Temple still remain below Munsubong although it was said to have been destroyed by a huge number of bedbugs. 500m from Munsubong to the south, horse riding trails of the four generals are dotted along the ridge; Malttongbawi (Horse Dung Rock), resembling horse droppings, is 500m from the peak to the southeast.<br><br>Below Munsubong are four large peaks where the four generals lived and 100 small rocks beneath them that were home to low ranking men commanded by the generals.
