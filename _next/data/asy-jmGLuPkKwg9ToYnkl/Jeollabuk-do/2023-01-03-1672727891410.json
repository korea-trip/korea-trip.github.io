The burial ground covers an area of more than 18,520 square meters and is officially listed as Historical Site No. 347. To date, a total of eight tumuli have been excavated, all of which are chamber tombs. <br><br>Surprisingly enough, the tombs were first discovered in 1986 by a high school student. While digging for arrowroot, a young man from a local high school found some pieces of gold that resembled a hat. He quickly notified the authorities and it was soon discovered that the pieces of gold were in fact valuable ancient artifacts. An emergency excavation was conducted and the eight tumuli were uncovered, but unfortunately all of the tumuli except Tomb No. 1 had been severely damaged. Tomb No. 1, which is still in relatively good condition, boasts an entrance measuring an impressive 16 meters in x_height and 2 meters in x_width. <br><br>Inside the tombs archaeologists found valuable relics from the Baekje dynasty including earthenware, jewelry (a gilt-bronze hat, gold earrings, glass beads, etc.), harnesses and ironware. Given the shapes and the types of the pieces found, historians estimate that the tumuli were built in the 5th century. Since the gilt-bronze hat is similar in shape to those found in Japan, experts believe that there was an active exchange between the Baekje people and the people of Japan.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-63-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-63-859-5875|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-03-1672727891410/573723_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-03-1672727891410/573723_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-03-1672727891410/573724_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-03-1672727891410/573724_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-03-1672727891410/573727_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-03-1672727891410/573727_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-03-1672727891410/573728_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-03-1672727891410/573728_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-63-859-5875](tel:+82638595875)\n- [üè†www.iksan.go.kr/tour</a> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br><a href=\"http://www.cha.go.kr/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"ÏÉàÏ∞Ω : Î¨∏ÌôîÏû¨Ï≤≠ ÌôàÌéòÏù¥ÏßÄÎ°ú Ïù¥Îèô\" >www.cha.go.kr](http://www.iksan.go.kr/tour/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.0468524591\nlongitude: 126.8721330900\ntitle: 80, Ipjeomgobun-gil, Iksan-si, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Train + Bus]<br>\nFrom Seoul Station or Yongsan Station, take a train to Iksan Station.<br>\nFrom Iksan Station, take Bus No. 35 or 35-1 and get off at Ipjeom Bus Stop. <br>Walk for approx. 10-20 min.\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-03-1672727891410","title":"Iksan Ipjeomni Ancient Tombs (ÏùµÏÇ∞ ÏûÖÏ†êÎ¶¨ Í≥†Î∂Ñ)","description":"The Iksan Ipjeomni Ancient Tombs are a group of ancient Baekje-era tumuli located 100 meters above sea level on the northeast brow of Chilmokjae Hill in Ipjeom-ri, Iksan-si, Jeollabuk-do.
