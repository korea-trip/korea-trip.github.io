Full of thick groves of larch trees, Korean white pines, rigida pines, and plenty of broad-leaved trees, the forest and its streams offer a cool and refreshing retreat. In spring, the forest is beautiful with wildflowers, azaleas and wild cherry blossom trees. In summer, families flock to the streams shaded by the thick forest canopy. As summer turns into fall, the whole area transforms into a rainbow of bright yellow, red, and orange. With the coming of winter, the snow covers the trees and blankets the ground, turning the forest in a winter dreamland.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|accomcount:|Up to 5,000 people|\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-63-263-8680|\n|opendate:|July 23, 1998|\n|parking:|Available (600 spaces)|\n|usetime:|[Accommodations] Check in 15:00 / Check out 11:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 2,000 won / Teenagers 1,500 won / Children 1,000 won<br>Groups - Adults 1,500 won / Teenagers 1,000 won / Children 500 won<br /><br />* Group: 30 people or more|\n|Available Facilities:|* Accommodations: Forest House, Hyuyanggwan, camping site<br>* Grass plaza, restaurants, snack bar<br>* Other facilities: Fitness facilities, playgrounds, water play area, hiking path (29 km), multi-purpose plaza, campfire area, outdoor stage, outdoor classrooms, etc.|\n|Facility Utilization Fees:|[Forest House & Recreation Hall]<br>Peak Season 60,000-200,000 won / Low Season 40,000-160,000 won<br><br>[Seminar Room]<br>120,000 won (4 hours / 30,000 won per hour)<br>* Admission fee charged separately.<br><br>[Caravan]<br>Peak Season 60,000 won / Low Season 40,000 won<br><br>[Dome House]<br>Peak Season 70,000 won / Low Season 50,000 won[Adventure Facilities]<br>- Sonogong Course: Individuals 5,000 won / Groups 4,000 won<br>- Jeopalgye Course: Individuals 7,000 won / Groups 6,000 won<br>- Super Board Course: Individuals 7,000 won / Groups 6,000 won|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-01-1659360092237/609004_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659360092237/609004_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659360092237/609006_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659360092237/609006_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659360092237/609008_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659360092237/609008_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659360092237/609010_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659360092237/609010_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659360092237/609011_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659360092237/609011_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659360092237/609013_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659360092237/609013_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659360092237/609016_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659360092237/609016_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659360092237/609019_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659360092237/609019_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659360092237/609022_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659360092237/609022_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659360092237/609024_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659360092237/609024_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-63-263-8680](tel:+82632638680)\n- [üè†www.foresttrip.go.kr](https://www.foresttrip.go.kr/indvz/main.do?hmpgId=ID02030025)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.9598381103\nlongitude: 127.2340169664\ntitle: 246, Gosanhyuyangnim-ro, Wanju-gun, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Taxi]<br>\nFrom Gosan Bus Terminal, take a taxi for approx. 5 min to Gosan Recreational Forest.\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-01-1659360092237","title":"Gosan Recreational Forest (Í≥†ÏÇ∞ÏûêÏó∞Ìú¥ÏñëÎ¶º)","description":"Located in Osan-ri, Gosan Recreational Forest is a popular family destination throughout all four seasons.

The temple was burnt down during the Imjin War (1592-1598), leaving only Bogwangjeon Hall.
