The temple was founded by Great Monk Uisang (625-702) upon orders from the king. When Uisang was studying in the Dang dynasty of China, he heard of a plot by the Dang dynasty to attack Silla. Upon hearing this, he hurried home and passed the message along to the king. The temple was created to pray for protection of the country.<br><br>Buseoksa Temple gets its name from a large stone to the west of Buljeon Hall, that appears to be floating rather than supported by the stone beneath it. During the Goryeo dynasty, the temple was referred to Seondalsa Temple or Heunggyosa Temple. During excavation work in 1916, records of the temple's repair work were discovered. According to these findings, it was learned that Muryangsujeon Hall and other buildings were rebuilt in the early part of the Goryeo dynasty. The hall burned down during war in 1358, and was later rebuilt in 1376.

Some of the most unique of these outcroppings are black and white stripes like that of a zebra, and eye structures. The striped structures were formed when the white and black components of the rock were separated by high heat and then pressed together under strong pressure. The eye-shaped structures were made by the white components combining.","regDate":"2022-07-29","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Valleys"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-29-1659100524331/183272_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-07-29-1659100524331"},{"id":"2022-07-29-1659094611502","title":"Bunhwangsa Temple (Î∂ÑÌô©ÏÇ¨)","description":"Bunhwangsa Temple is located next to Hwangnyongsa Temple Site in Gyeongju, and is famous for Stone Brick Pagoda, National Treasure No. 30.

While the stone pagoda is presumed to be originally a 5-9 story structure, only 3 stories remain today. Much of the damage to the padoga happened during the Imjin War (1592-1598).
