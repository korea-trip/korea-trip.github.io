Now there are many seafood restaurants, various auxiliary facilities, and an amusement park that rest on reclaimed land. Because the inlet is located on the west coast where the difference in the water level between high and low tide is great, fishing boats avoid the area during the shifting tides. But, whenever the boats return, visitors can enjoy fresh sushi and other seafood.
