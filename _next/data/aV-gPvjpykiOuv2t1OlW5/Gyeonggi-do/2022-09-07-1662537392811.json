Now there are many seafood restaurants, various auxiliary facilities, and an amusement park that rest on reclaimed land. Because the inlet is located on the west coast where the difference in the water level between high and low tide is great, fishing boats avoid the area during the shifting tides. But, whenever the boats return, visitors can enjoy fresh sushi and other seafood. The Marine World facilities have authentic European-style restaurants, an outdoor seawater pool that can be used free of charge, and a barbecue facility along with other amenities.","regDate":"2022-09-19","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-19-1663593675934/2524568_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-09-19-1663593675934"},{"id":"2022-09-17-1663397434630","title":"Songam Space Center (ÏÜ°ÏïîÏä§ÌéòÏù¥Ïä§ÏÑºÌÑ∞)","description":"Songam Space Center, set against the gorgeous backdrop of nearby Jangheung Park, Yangju-si, Gyeonggi-do, is one of the largest space themed parks in Korea.
