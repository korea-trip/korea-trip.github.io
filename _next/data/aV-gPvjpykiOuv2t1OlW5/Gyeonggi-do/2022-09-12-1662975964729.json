The resort shares the area with various cultural relics such as Yongmunsa Temple; Yongmunsa Temple‚Äôs gingko tree; a stupa containing a relic of the Buddha, a monument of the reverend monk Jeongji; and the Yongmunsan Mountain area‚Äôs war record monument. The resort area is frequented by visitors throughout all four seasons but is especially popular in the fall because of the yellow-tinged gingko tree of Yongmunsa Temple (a Natural Monument).  <br><br>\nA 2 kilometers trek through the valley from Yongmunsa Temple will bring you to Yonggakbawi Rock, shaped like a dragon‚Äôs horn, halfway up the mountain. 1km away from Yonggakbawi Rock lays a huge boulder, Court Rock, on which 100 people can easily sit at the same time. There is also an amusement park that provides great entertainment for children, consisting of a rapid ride, a Viking-boat, a merry-go-round, bumper cars, a family coaster, and other rides. <br><br>\nThirty minutes from Yongmunsa Temple is Jungwon Valley that looks small when seen from the outside, but leads to the mountain‚Äôs summit where you can enjoy a superb view. And only another fifteen minutes walk will bring you to the three-tiered Jungwon Falls where you can enjoy the sound of crashing waters and feel the cooling mists that rise from the base of the falls.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-31-773-0088|\n|parking:|Available (1,000 parking spaces)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Parking Fees:|Compact vehicles: 1,000 won / Mid-sized vehicles: 3,000 won / Buses: 5,000 won|\n|Available Facilities:|Museum, water fountain, foot-volleyball court, drinking fountain, basketball court, outdoor stage, playground, restaurant, etc.|\n|Admission Fees:|Indivuals: Adults 2,500 won / Teenagers 1,700 won / Children 1,000 won<BR>Groups: Adults 2,300 won / Teenagers 1,500 won / Children 800 won|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098793_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098793_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098798_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098798_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098860_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098860_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098874_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098874_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098933_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098933_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098976_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098976_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098784_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098784_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098806_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098806_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098813_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098813_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098816_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-12-1662975964729/1098816_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-31-773-0088](tel:+82317730088)\n- [üè†tour.yp21.net ](https://tour.yp21.go.kr/www/selectTourCntntsWebView.do?tourNo=173&key=69&ctgry=4)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5469452446\nlongitude: 127.5809612468\ntitle: Sinjeom-ri, Yangpyeong-gun, Gyeonggi-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-09-12-1662975964729","title":"Yongmunsan Resort (Ïö©Î¨∏ÏÇ∞ Í¥ÄÍ¥ëÏßÄ)","description":"Yongmunsan Mountain in Yangpyeong, Gyeonggi-do, is comprised of Doilbong Peak, Baegunbong Peak, and other peaks.

Now there are many seafood restaurants, various auxiliary facilities, and an amusement park that rest on reclaimed land. Because the inlet is located on the west coast where the difference in the water level between high and low tide is great, fishing boats avoid the area during the shifting tides. But, whenever the boats return, visitors can enjoy fresh sushi and other seafood.
