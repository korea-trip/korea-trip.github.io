In Korean, the burial mounds of kings and queens are named <em>reung</em> or <em>neung</em>, while those of kings’ parents, crown princes and princesses are called <em>won</em>, and the burial mounds of other princes and princesses are called <em>myo</em>.<br><br>\n\nWest Five Royal Tombs consists of Gyeongneung (the tomb of posthumously designated rulers, King Deokjong and Queen Sohye), Changneung (the tomb of King Yejong, the 8th ruler, and Queen Ansun), Hongneung (the tomb of Queen Jeongseong, a consort to King Yeongjo, the 21st ruler), Ingneung (the tomb of Queen Ingyeong, a consort to King Sukjong) and Myeongneung (the tomb of King Sukjong, the 19th ruler, and his two wives, Queen Inhyeon and Queen Inwon). <br><br>\n\nIn addition to the five reungs in West Five Royal Tombs, there are three wons.

In 1991 a land reclaimation project succeeded in creating a new recreation site. Now there are many seafood restaurants, various auxiliary facilities, and an amusement park that rest on reclaimed land. Because the inlet is located on the west coast where the difference in the water level between high and low tide is great, fishing boats avoid the area during the shifting tides. But, whenever the boats return, visitors can enjoy fresh sushi and other seafood. The Marine World facilities have authentic European-style restaurants, an outdoor seawater pool that can be used free of charge, and a barbecue facility along with other amenities.","regDate":"2022-09-19","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-19-1663593675934/2524568_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-09-19-1663593675934"},{"id":"2022-09-17-1663397434630","title":"Songam Space Center (송암스페이스센터)","description":"Songam Space Center, set against the gorgeous backdrop of nearby Jangheung Park, Yangju-si, Gyeonggi-do, is one of the largest space themed parks in Korea.
