Well-known for its rich soil, the most outstanding natural resources of Gurye is Jirisan National Park, the first to be designated as a national park, and Seomjingang River. <br><br>Every year, many hikers visit Jirisan National Park, also called the ‚Äúbosom of a mother.‚Äù The park is cherished for its unpolluted scenery, such as its deep and wide geographical features and crystal clear valleys. The park offers diverse hiking trails and has mountain retreats for backpackers. <br><br>Jirisan Dulegil Trail that runs along the periphery of Jirisan Mountain is where one could enjoy the experience of mountain glens, different from mountaineering. On their way hikers and trekkers can see groups of Sansuyu (cornus fruit) in spring as well as the autumnal tints of the mountain and valley in autumn. <br><br>Another strength is that the park has different types of accommodations including Hanok (Korean traditional house) homestay and a guest house, apart from leisure facilities including hot springs in Jirisan. The park is a great place for historical inquiries as it is filled with historic temples, including Hwaeomsa Temple and Yeongoksa Temple, and historic relics. Flowing from Gokseong to Hadong, Seomjingang River creates a tranquil ambience. The cleanest ever in Korea, a large number of marsh snails and sweetfish live in this river. Visitors can also enjoy the scenic view from the riverside road and various festivals which are held all year round, such as the Sansuyu Festival, the Seomjingang Riverside Cherry Flower Festival and the Piagol Autumn Foliage Festival. <br><br>* Current State of Gurye Special Tourist Zone<br>1) Districts Covered / Areas around Toji, Masan, Gwangui and Sandong-myeon, Gurye-gun, Jeollanam-do<br>2) Area / 78,024,000„é° <br><br>* Tourist Attractions<br>Jirisan Mountain, Seomjingang River, Jirisan Spa Land, Piagol Valley, Sansuyu Theme Park, Hwaeomsa, Cheoneunsa and Yeongoksa Temple, Hanok Village, etc.","regDate":"2023-01-20","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollanam-do","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Tourist Complexes"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-20-1674211096417/1917883_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollanam-do/2023-01-20-1674211096417"},{"id":"2023-01-20-1674207389792","title":"Gurye Seomjingang Cherry Blossom Trail (Íµ¨Î°Ä ÏÑ¨ÏßÑÍ∞ï Î≤öÍΩÉÍ∏∏)","description":"The Seomjingang Cherry Blossom Trail in Gurye follows National Roads 17 and 19 along the pristine Seomgjingang River.

He is known to be the grandson of the heavens and the son of Hwanung. According to the legend, Hwanung was approached by a bear and a tiger who wished to become human beings. Hwanung attended to their plea by instructing them to avoid sunlight for 100 days and live only by consuming garlic and mugwort. Unlike the tiger who gave up, the bear followed the instructions faithfully and transformed into a woman, who then married Hwanung and gave birth to Dangun.<br><br> Located near Yeonguncheonbyeon in Gokseong-eup, Dangunjeon Shrine was first founded in Hakjeong-ri, Samin-dong in 1916 by Shin Tae-yun, also known as Baekdang, but later moved to its current location and went through reconstruction in 1931. An annual ancestral rite takes place at the shrine on October 3 (National Foundation Day) and March 15 to pay respects to Dangun. Dangunjeon Shrine was also a place where civilians gathered to take an oath of patriotism in action against the Japanese during the Japanese colonization period; a stone plaque commemorating the March 1st Independence Movement and Baekdang Memorial Hall dedicated to Shin Tae-yun can also be found within the area. Shin Tae-yun was captured by Japanese soldiers during the March 1st Independence Movement and served two years in prison.","regDate":"2023-01-20","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollanam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-20-1674196823651/1609432_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollanam-do/2023-01-20-1674196823651"},{"id":"2023-01-20-1674192977194","title":"Geumseongsanseong Fortress (Îã¥Ïñë Í∏àÏÑ±ÏÇ∞ÏÑ±)","description":"Geumseongsanseong Fortress in Geumseongsan Mountain (603m) forms a boundary between two small villages located on the border of two provinces (Geumseong-myeon, Damyang-gun, Jeollanam-do and Sunchang-gun, Jeollabuk-do) and is one of the three popular mountains of the Honam region (the Southwestern region of Korea that includes Jeollanam-do and Jeollabuk-do).
