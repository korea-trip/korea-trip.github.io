Officially designated a city park in April 1978, it is centered around a natural pond, which dates back to the Goryeo dynasty (918-1392). The park is such a landmark of the area that the lotus flowers blooming in the park‚Äôs large pond are considered one of the most impressive attractions of Jeonju. The park spans an area of 13,000 „é° with the pond covering about two thirds of the southern sector. An arch-shaped suspension bridge stretches across the middle of the pond, offering up-close views of the lotus blossoms. <br><br>\n\nPark designers created a traditional pavilion and a water iris garden in honor of the park‚Äôs historical background and added an artificial waterfall and wooden bridge for visual effect. The park also houses nine stone monuments including the Children‚Äôs Charter, engravings of Shin Seok-jeong and Kim Hae-gang‚Äôs poetry, and a statue of General Jeon Bong-jun. <br><br>\n\nThe park is the site of the annual Dano Changpomul (Water Iris) Festival, a much-anticipated event held on the day of Dano (a Korean traditional holiday that falls on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month). During the celebration, women wash their hair in iris-infused water from the pond to wish for good health in the coming year.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-63-239-2607|\n|parking:|Available (70 spaces)|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|useseason:|Mid-July~early August (Lotus flower blooming season)|\n|usetime:|Open 24 hr|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-31-1659289135246/1605385_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659289135246/1605385_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659289135246/1605387_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659289135246/1605387_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659289135246/1605388_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659289135246/1605388_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659289135246/1605389_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659289135246/1605389_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659289135246/1605390_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659289135246/1605390_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659289135246/1605391_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659289135246/1605391_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659289135246/2366391_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659289135246/2366391_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659289135246/2366392_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659289135246/2366392_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659289135246/2366394_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659289135246/2366394_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659289135246/2366395_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659289135246/2366395_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-63-239-2607](tel:+82632392607)\n- [üè†www.jjss.or.kr](http://www.jjss.or.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.8475156135\nlongitude: 127.1218687977\ntitle: 390, Gwonsamdeuk-ro, Deokjin-gu, Jeonju-si, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-31-1659289135246","title":"Deokjin Park (ÎçïÏßÑÍ≥µÏõê)","description":"Deokjin Park is a representative city park of Jeonju.
