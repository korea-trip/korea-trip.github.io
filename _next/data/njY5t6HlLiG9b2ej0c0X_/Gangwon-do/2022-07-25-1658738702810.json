In this zone, visitors have various ways to enjoy Seoraksan Mountain and the natural environment of the East Sea region. <br><br>Sokcho, which occupies the largest area in the zone, comes first when talking about Seoraksan National Park. Tourists can appreciate the picturesque scenery of the sea and coastal lakes as well as the mountain scenery of Seoraksan Mountain. Hikers can climb the mountain or ride a cable car. Sokcho Beach is a hot spot that attracts young people who fill the place with energy and life all through the summer. <br><br>Abai Village, which appeared in several TV dramas for its unique atmosphere, and Sokcho Jungang Market offer local specialties, such as abai sundae (Korean sausage) and dak gangjeong (glazed fried chicken  bites). <br><br>Goseong, which is bordered by Seoraksan Mountain and Geumgangsan Mountain, is part of the Northern Limit Line (NLL) that offers a unpolluted, beautiful landscape around the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).

One-way ticket is not available, so visitors need to buy a round-trip ticket. Visitors can also enjoy an open view of various famous attractions such as Ulsan Peak and Manmulsang Rocks beyond glass window in the cable car. The Gwongeumseong Fortress, unfolding a panoramic view of Seoraksan Mountain‚Äôs majestic scenery, bears a legend in which two generals Gwon and Kim built the fortress in one day to prevent enemy invasion during the Goryeo period. Today, the site of the fortress only remains. Many hikers come up to the summit of the fortress despite its rough course to appreciate magnificent and mysterious scenery of strange rocks and bizarre stones at Seoraksan Mountain. When you are at the summit, you can see the landscape of not only the Outer Seorak but also the Inner Seorak. Below the Gwongeumseong Fortress are Allagam Hermitage built during the Silla period and Muhaksong (Korean red pine) existed for hundreds of years. As many tourists visit the mountain at weekends and during public holidays and autumn foliage season, it is recommended to schedule your trip by considering the waiting time too.","regDate":"2022-10-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-12-1665550201815/1950308_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-12-1665550201815"},{"id":"2022-10-11-1665485398263","title":"Seongyojang House (Í∞ïÎ¶â ÏÑ†ÍµêÏû•)","description":"Seongyojang House is the former upper class residence of  Lee Nae-beon (1703-1781) and his family in Gangneung, Gangwon-do.
