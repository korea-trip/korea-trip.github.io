{"pageProps":{"content":"![Guryongsa Temple (Íµ¨Î£°ÏÇ¨)](/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2391453_image2_1.webp)\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> Guryongsa Temple is located 6 kilometers from Birobong Peak on Chiaksan Mountain, in the direction of Hakkok-ri. It was believed that Monk Uisang (625-702) of the Silla Kingdom (57 BC - AD 935) built and named the temple Guryongsa in 668 during the reign of King Munmu. However, it is now known that the temple was built after King Sukjong, the 19th King of the Joseon dynasty (1392-1910), who reigned from 1674 to 1720, because of the architectural style of Daeungjeon Hall. There is a legend that the Guryongsa Temple site was originally a lake where nine dragons lived. The name Guryong comes from the story that the lake was filled up to build the temple on it. There are many buildings such as Daeungjeon Hall, Bogwangnu Pavilion, Samseonggak Pavilion, Simgeomdang Hall and Seolseondang Hall. Daeungjeon Hall has maintained its original shape though it was repaired many times.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-33-732-4800|\n|parking:|Available (Chiaksan National Park)|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Sunrise - Sunset|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Hiking Course:|* Guryongsa Temple - Seryeompokpo Falls - Birobong Peak - Guryongsa Temple (10.9 km / 6 hr)<br>* Guryongsa Temple - Seryeompokpo Falls - Birobong Peak - Godeunchi - Bugok-ri (15.8 km / 8 hr)<br>* Hwanggol Cave - Ipseoksa Temple - Birobong Peak - Seryeompokpo Falls - Guryongsa Temple (10.7 km / 5 hr)<br>* Hanggu-dong - Gukhyangsa Temple - Hyangnobong Peak - Seryeompokpo Falls - Guryongsa Temple (14.2 km / 7 hr)<br>* Geumdae-ri - Yeongwonsa Temple - Namdaebong Peak - Birobong Peak - Seryeompokpo Falls - Guryongsa Temple (22.6 km / 12 hr)<br>* Seongnam-ri - Sangwonsa Temple - Namdaebong Peak - Birobong Peak - Seryeompokpo Falls - Guryongsa Temple (23.8 km / 13 hr)|\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 2,500 won / Teenagers 800 won / Children 500 won<br>Groups - Adults 2,300 won / Teenagers 700 won / Children 400 won<br><br>* Groups: 30 people or more|\n|Parking Fees:|Compact vehicles: First hour 500 won / each additional 10 min 100 won / Max. daily fee 5,000 won / Monthly pass 50,000 won<br>Small & Mid-sized vehicles: First hour 1,100 won / each additional 10 min 250 won (peak season 300 won) / Max. daily fee 13,000 won / Monthly pass 150,000 won<br>Large vehicles: First hour 2,000 won / each additional 10 min 400 won (peak season 500 won) / Max. daily fee 20,000 won / Monthly pass 200,000 won|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2391440_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2391440_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2391442_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2391442_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2391445_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2391445_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2391446_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2391446_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2391447_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2391447_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2391448_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2391448_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2648995_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2648995_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2648997_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2648997_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2648998_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2648998_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2391441_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2391441_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-33-732-4800](tel:+82337324800)\n- [üè†www.templestay.com](https://www.templestay.com/temple_info.asp?t_id=guryongsa )\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.3995043418\nlongitude: 128.0498675732\ntitle: 500, Guryongsa-ro, Wonju-si, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Train + Bus]<br>\nFrom Cheongnyangni Station, take a train to Wonju Station.<br>\nFrom Wonju Station, take Bus No. 41 and get off at Guryongsa Temple Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-09-25-1664091631316","title":"Guryongsa Temple (Íµ¨Î£°ÏÇ¨)","description":"Guryongsa Temple is located 6 kilometers from Birobong Peak on Chiaksan Mountain, in the direction of Hakkok-ri.

In this zone, visitors have various ways to enjoy Seoraksan Mountain and the natural environment of the East Sea region. <br><br>Sokcho, which occupies the largest area in the zone, comes first when talking about Seoraksan National Park. Tourists can appreciate the picturesque scenery of the sea and coastal lakes as well as the mountain scenery of Seoraksan Mountain. Hikers can climb the mountain or ride a cable car. Sokcho Beach is a hot spot that attracts young people who fill the place with energy and life all through the summer. <br><br>Abai Village, which appeared in several TV dramas for its unique atmosphere, and Sokcho Jungang Market offer local specialties, such as abai sundae (Korean sausage) and dak gangjeong (glazed fried chicken  bites). <br><br>Goseong, which is bordered by Seoraksan Mountain and Geumgangsan Mountain, is part of the Northern Limit Line (NLL) that offers a unpolluted, beautiful landscape around the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). Hwajinpo Beach near Hwajinpo Lake, which is a lagoon, and Songjiho Beach near Songjiho Lake are the best places to spend a peaceful vacation.

The cable car boarding station is located in the Small Park of Seoraksan National Park. It takes about 10 min to get to the Gwongeumseong Fortress (700m above sea level) by the cable car. One-way ticket is not available, so visitors need to buy a round-trip ticket. Visitors can also enjoy an open view of various famous attractions such as Ulsan Peak and Manmulsang Rocks beyond glass window in the cable car. The Gwongeumseong Fortress, unfolding a panoramic view of Seoraksan Mountain‚Äôs majestic scenery, bears a legend in which two generals Gwon and Kim built the fortress in one day to prevent enemy invasion during the Goryeo period. Today, the site of the fortress only remains. Many hikers come up to the summit of the fortress despite its rough course to appreciate magnificent and mysterious scenery of strange rocks and bizarre stones at Seoraksan Mountain. When you are at the summit, you can see the landscape of not only the Outer Seorak but also the Inner Seorak. Below the Gwongeumseong Fortress are Allagam Hermitage built during the Silla period and Muhaksong (Korean red pine) existed for hundreds of years. As many tourists visit the mountain at weekends and during public holidays and autumn foliage season, it is recommended to schedule your trip by considering the waiting time too.","regDate":"2022-10-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-12-1665550201815/1950308_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-12-1665550201815"},{"id":"2022-10-11-1665485398263","title":"Seongyojang House (Í∞ïÎ¶â ÏÑ†ÍµêÏû•)","description":"Seongyojang House is the former upper class residence of  Lee Nae-beon (1703-1781) and his family in Gangneung, Gangwon-do.
