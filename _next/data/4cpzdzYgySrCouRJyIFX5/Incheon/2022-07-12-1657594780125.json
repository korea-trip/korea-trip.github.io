In the past, the island was called Ijeokdo Island because it served as a hideout for pirates. The sea, mountain, and shoal exist in harmony.<br>\n<br>\n The beauty of Daeijakdo Island comes from the view of the blue ocean from the peak of Buasan Mountain and the shoal that only appears during low tide. The shoal almost reaches Soijakdo Island and creates a large field of sand.

The fortress was the scene of many hard-fought battles including the invasions of America and Japan in the 1870s. The site was then taken by the foreign troops due to the inferior fighting power of the Korean military, and very nearly completely destroyed. In 1876 (13th year of King Gojong), the Japanese warship Unyangho invaded and forced the Joseon Kingdom to open their ports, which later led to the forced signing of the Jana-Korea Treaty of 1876. Only the base of the fortress and the site of the high ground remained until 1973, when restoration work was started. The patriotic spirit of the Joseon dynasty still remains in this historic site.","regDate":"2022-08-10","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-10-1660131384858/1577834_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-08-10-1660131384858"},{"id":"2022-08-10-1660128078065","title":"Ganghwa Bomunsa Temple (Î≥¥Î¨∏ÏÇ¨ (Í∞ïÌôî))","description":"Bomunsa Temple is located on Seongmodo Island in the Gangwondo Island district.
