Yi Hwangs ancestral tablet was enshrined inside Sangdeoksa Shrine (Treasure No. 211) in 1572. Two years later, Jeongyodang Lecture Hall (Treasure No. 210) was built to relocate the tablet and with the addition of buildings to the halls east and west, the area became a seowon. In 1575, the establishment was bestowed a royal charter and a plaque with the name Dosanseowon written by Han Seok-bong, and became the Confucian academy headquarters in the Yeongnam region.","regDate":"2022-12-11","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-11-1670733665757/2620848_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-11-1670733665757"},{"id":"2022-12-11-1670729986250","title":"Bongpyeong Beach (Î¥âÌèâÌï¥ÏàòÏöïÏû•)","description":"Bongpyeong Beach in Uljin, Gyeongsangbuk-do is a 2 kilometer-long sand beach.
