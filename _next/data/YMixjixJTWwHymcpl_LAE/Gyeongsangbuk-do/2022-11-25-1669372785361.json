Rock art from the time period was created on rocks or other planes considered to be sacred and usually carried a message of fertility.

King Naemul was known as the first king to initiate the king title of ‘Maripgan’ and was known for spreading cultural advancements from China to the Korean people. When the allied forces of Baekje and Japan attacked, he asked Gwanggaeto the Great of Goguryeo for help and led the people to victory, contributing to the increased strength of the Silla Kingdom. After his rule, the throne was exclusively ceded to members of the Kim family clan.<br><br>The royal tomb of King Naemul is a large mound (22 m in diameter and 5.3 m in x_height) that sits on the northern hill of the Confucian school of Gyeongju. The edge of a natural stone is exposed around the bottom of the mound, pointing to the fact that the inner chamber tomb was made of stone. In the historical document Samguk Sagi (History of the Three Kingdoms), no records are found about the tomb, but the Samguk Yusa (Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms) describes the king’s tomb as being located in the southwest of Cheomseongdae, which is consistent with the tomb’s location.","regDate":"2022-11-29","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-29-1669700202072/1954895_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-11-29-1669700202072"},{"id":"2022-11-29-1669697007054","title":"Gyeongju Poseokjeong Pavilion Site (경주 포석정지)","description":"Poseokjeong Pavilion served as a separate palace where kings enjoyed banquets with nobles.

The water canal has an estimated length of 10 meters, with a x_width of approximately 35 centimeters and an average depth of 26 centimeters. Based on Chinese writings from 353, it is said that drinking glasses were floated on the canal. One popular party game had guests creating poems before the glass had passed nine sections of the canel. Guests who could not do this had to drink three glasses. Modern research has shown that the site was not merely a place for fun, but also served as a meeting venue for the royal family, as well as for holding memorial services.","regDate":"2022-11-29","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-29-1669697007054/179843_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-11-29-1669697007054"},{"id":"2022-11-29-1669693504852","title":"Gyeongju National Park (경주국립공원)","description":"Gyeongju National Park differs from most of Koreas national parks in that it is centered around cultural heritages rather than natural resouces.

This mountain boasts nearly 40 valleys winding down from Geumobong Peak (468 meters in elevation), Gowibong Peak (494 meters in elevation), and other surrounding peaks. Also, this 4-kilometer-wide and 8-kilometer-long oval-shaped mountain runs almost perfectly north to south.<br><br>Namsan Mountain is a veritable open-air museum, with 100 temple sites, 80 stone Buddha statues, and 60 stone pagodas scattered across the mountainside. Topographically, it features nearly 40 valleys and is divided into the Southwest Mountain, a sacred place during the Silla period, and the Southeast Mountain, where many Buddhas can be found around the valleys.<br><br>Najeong Well, at the western foot of Namsan Mountain, is the mythic birthplace of King Park Hyeokgeose, founder of the Silla Kingdom. The local Yangsanjae Shrine was built in honor of its founder who lived in Seorabeol before the Silla Kingdom was established. Poseokjeong Pavilion is the place where the glorious era of the Silla Kingdom came to an end. In the Southeast Mountain region, one can encounter the Stone Seated Buddha of Borisa Temple, a 9-meter-high Rock Buddha Statue at Bulmusa Temple, and a Stone Seated Stone Buddha at Gamsil Shrine. <br><br>Namsan Mountain also features 11 treasures, including Stone Seated Buddha of Mireukgol (Borisa Temple), Three-story Stone Pagoda of Yongjangsa Temple Site, the Rock-carved Buddha at Chilburam Hermitage, and others. There are also twelve historic sites, such as the site of Poseokjeong Pavilion, Najeong Well, and Samneung Royal Tombs, as well as nine local tangible cultural properties, and one important piece of folklore material.<br><br>Namsan Mountain is also famous for its scenic landscapes in addition to its cultural heritage. Numerous valleys, unique rock formations, and beautiful trails are abundant throughout the area. Many tourists say, “You cannot say that you know Gyeongju without hiking up Namsan Mountain.” Namsan Mountain is a place where the scenic nature and long history of the Silla Kingdom coexist, and also where the aesthetic consciousness and religious traditions of the Silla people evolved into the artform it is today.","regDate":"2022-11-28","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-28-1669632048970/2037050_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-11-28-1669632048970"},{"id":"2022-11-28-1669628257001","title":"Gyeongju Najeong Well (경주 나정)","description":"To the southeast of the royal tomb, is a small monument that has been erected among the pine trees; next to the monument is a well called Najeong.

In 69 BC, Sobeolgong, the head of Goheochon Village, saw a white horse on its knees by the well. When he approached the well he found that the horse had magically disappeared and that a large egg was left in its place, from which a boy was born. When the boy turned 13 years old (57 BC), he was appointed king by the village chiefs and began to rule the area then called ‘Seorabeol’. A memorial stone (2.25 meters high, 45 centimeters long, and 21 centimeters wide) was erected in 1803 in the third year of King Sunjos rule (Joseon dynasty) detailing the historical origins of the founding father of Silla.","regDate":"2022-11-28","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-28-1669628257001/681164_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-11-28-1669628257001"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
