{"pageProps":{"content":"![Gyeongju Gyerim Forest (경주 계림)](/2022-11-28-1669613785218/2493186_image2_1.webp)\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> Gyerim Forest is located between the Cheomseongdae Observatory and Wolseong Fortress. The forest is thickly populated by ancient zelkova and willow trees rooted on gently sloping hills and along the small stream in the northwest part of the woods. According to legend, the forest is closely associated with myths surrounding the birth of Alji, the founder of the Gyeongju Kim clan. As such, it is designated national Historic Site No. 19. <br>Legend has it that King Talhae heard a rooster crying from deep inside the Sirim Woods. Chancellor Hogong was sent to investigate. Upon arriving, he found a rooster crying underneath a tree on which hung a golden box. Hogong immediately reported his find to the king, who instructed him to bring the golden box into the palace. The king opened the box and found a small child inside, Kim Alji. The forest, which had previously been called ‘Sirim’ or ‘Gurim’, became known as ‘Gyerim’, (gye’ meaning rooster). The name Gyerim was also used to refer to the Silla kingdom. <br>Alji was adopted as the king’s son, but because the crown was passed on to King Pasa of the Park family, he never ascended the throne. The Kim clan later became the royal bloodline with the coronation of King Naemul some years later. <br> The memorial stone recording the birth of Kim Alji was erected in the third year of King Sunjos rule in the Joseon dynasty. Located close to the royal fortress of Silla, the forest is still deeply revered as the mystical birthplace of the first ancestor of the royal Kim clan of Silla. Yellow canola blossoms along the path connecting Daereungwon with Gyerim and Banwolseong only add to the magical ambiance of the forest.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-54-779-8743~8759|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-28-1669613785218/2493184_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-28-1669613785218/2493184_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-28-1669613785218/2493185_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-28-1669613785218/2493185_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-28-1669613785218/2493188_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-28-1669613785218/2493188_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-28-1669613785218/2493189_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-28-1669613785218/2493189_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-28-1669613785218/2493190_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-28-1669613785218/2493190_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-28-1669613785218/2493191_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-28-1669613785218/2493191_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-28-1669613785218/2493193_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-28-1669613785218/2493193_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-28-1669613785218/2493194_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-28-1669613785218/2493194_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-28-1669613785218/2493195_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-28-1669613785218/2493195_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-28-1669613785218/2493187_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-28-1669613785218/2493187_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-54-779-8743](tel:+82547798743)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.8326469552\nlongitude: 129.2189978270\ntitle: Gyo-dong, Gyeongju-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Seoul Express Bus Terminal, take an express bus to Gyeongju Bus Terminal.<br>From Gyeongju Bus Terminal Bus Stop, take Bus No. 600 and get off at Wolseong-dong Community Office Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-28-1669613785218","title":"Gyeongju Gyerim Forest (경주 계림)","description":"Gyerim Forest is located between the Cheomseongdae Observatory and Wolseong Fortress.

King Naemul was known as the first king to initiate the king title of ‘Maripgan’ and was known for spreading cultural advancements from China to the Korean people. When the allied forces of Baekje and Japan attacked, he asked Gwanggaeto the Great of Goguryeo for help and led the people to victory, contributing to the increased strength of the Silla Kingdom. After his rule, the throne was exclusively ceded to members of the Kim family clan.<br><br>The royal tomb of King Naemul is a large mound (22 m in diameter and 5.3 m in x_height) that sits on the northern hill of the Confucian school of Gyeongju. The edge of a natural stone is exposed around the bottom of the mound, pointing to the fact that the inner chamber tomb was made of stone. In the historical document Samguk Sagi (History of the Three Kingdoms), no records are found about the tomb, but the Samguk Yusa (Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms) describes the king’s tomb as being located in the southwest of Cheomseongdae, which is consistent with the tomb’s location.","regDate":"2022-11-29","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-29-1669700202072/1954895_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-11-29-1669700202072"},{"id":"2022-11-29-1669697007054","title":"Gyeongju Poseokjeong Pavilion Site (경주 포석정지)","description":"Poseokjeong Pavilion served as a separate palace where kings enjoyed banquets with nobles.

The water canal has an estimated length of 10 meters, with a x_width of approximately 35 centimeters and an average depth of 26 centimeters. Based on Chinese writings from 353, it is said that drinking glasses were floated on the canal. One popular party game had guests creating poems before the glass had passed nine sections of the canel. Guests who could not do this had to drink three glasses. Modern research has shown that the site was not merely a place for fun, but also served as a meeting venue for the royal family, as well as for holding memorial services.","regDate":"2022-11-29","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-29-1669697007054/179843_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-11-29-1669697007054"},{"id":"2022-11-29-1669693504852","title":"Gyeongju National Park (경주국립공원)","description":"Gyeongju National Park differs from most of Koreas national parks in that it is centered around cultural heritages rather than natural resouces.

This mountain boasts nearly 40 valleys winding down from Geumobong Peak (468 meters in elevation), Gowibong Peak (494 meters in elevation), and other surrounding peaks. Also, this 4-kilometer-wide and 8-kilometer-long oval-shaped mountain runs almost perfectly north to south.<br><br>Namsan Mountain is a veritable open-air museum, with 100 temple sites, 80 stone Buddha statues, and 60 stone pagodas scattered across the mountainside. Topographically, it features nearly 40 valleys and is divided into the Southwest Mountain, a sacred place during the Silla period, and the Southeast Mountain, where many Buddhas can be found around the valleys.<br><br>Najeong Well, at the western foot of Namsan Mountain, is the mythic birthplace of King Park Hyeokgeose, founder of the Silla Kingdom. The local Yangsanjae Shrine was built in honor of its founder who lived in Seorabeol before the Silla Kingdom was established. Poseokjeong Pavilion is the place where the glorious era of the Silla Kingdom came to an end. In the Southeast Mountain region, one can encounter the Stone Seated Buddha of Borisa Temple, a 9-meter-high Rock Buddha Statue at Bulmusa Temple, and a Stone Seated Stone Buddha at Gamsil Shrine. <br><br>Namsan Mountain also features 11 treasures, including Stone Seated Buddha of Mireukgol (Borisa Temple), Three-story Stone Pagoda of Yongjangsa Temple Site, the Rock-carved Buddha at Chilburam Hermitage, and others.

Numerous valleys, unique rock formations, and beautiful trails are abundant throughout the area. Many tourists say, “You cannot say that you know Gyeongju without hiking up Namsan Mountain.” Namsan Mountain is a place where the scenic nature and long history of the Silla Kingdom coexist, and also where the aesthetic consciousness and religious traditions of the Silla people evolved into the artform it is today.","regDate":"2022-11-28","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-28-1669632048970/2037050_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-11-28-1669632048970"},{"id":"2022-11-28-1669628257001","title":"Gyeongju Najeong Well (경주 나정)","description":"To the southeast of the royal tomb, is a small monument that has been erected among the pine trees; next to the monument is a well called Najeong.

In 69 BC, Sobeolgong, the head of Goheochon Village, saw a white horse on its knees by the well. When he approached the well he found that the horse had magically disappeared and that a large egg was left in its place, from which a boy was born. When the boy turned 13 years old (57 BC), he was appointed king by the village chiefs and began to rule the area then called ‘Seorabeol’.
