With unique rock formations and thick forest, the valley creates an almost mystical atmosphere. Even though Bulyeongsa Valley is not as magnificent or splendid as Cheonbuldong Valley at Seoraksan Mountain or Mureung Valley and Bogyeongsa Valley at Odaesan Mountain, it offers a serene and beautiful view against the backdrop of Cheonchuksan Mountain.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-54-783-5004|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Hiking Course:|* Course 1 (Required time: 4 hrs): Seongnyugul cave - Uljin <br><br>* Course 2 (Required time: 5 hrs): Baegam hot spring - Uljin|\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals: Adults 2,000 won / Teenagers 1,500 won / Children 1,000 won<br><br>* 10% discount to groups of 30 people or more<br>* Adult (ages 19-65) / Teeenagers (ages 14-18) / Children (ages 8-13)<br>* Free admission: Senior citizens|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-08-1670474510444/183266_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-08-1670474510444/183266_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-08-1670474510444/202077_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-08-1670474510444/202077_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-08-1670474510444/202082_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-08-1670474510444/202082_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-08-1670474510444/202085_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-08-1670474510444/202085_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-08-1670474510444/202089_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-08-1670474510444/202089_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-08-1670474510444/202090_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-08-1670474510444/202090_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-08-1670474510444/202091_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-08-1670474510444/202091_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-08-1670474510444/2613136_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-08-1670474510444/2613136_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-54-783-5004](tel:+82547835004)\n- [🏠bulyoungsa.kr</a><br><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3v8e25d\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"새창 : 울진문화관광 사이트로 이동\">www.uljin.go.kr/tour](http://bulyoungsa.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.9410026143\nlongitude: 129.2740827178\ntitle: 48, Buryeongsa-gil, Uljin-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-08-1670474510444","title":"Uljin Bulyeongsa Temple (불영사(울진))","description":"<br>Bulyeongsa Temple, located at the western foot of Cheonchuksan Mountain in Uljin, Gyeongsangbuk-do, was built during the Silla period. ‘Bulyeongsa’ means ‘the reflection of Buddha’s shadow on the pond.’ A lovely path leads from the parking area to the temple, and a beautiful pond and green farm in the courtyard give the temple, inhabited by Buddhist nuns, a cozy and welcoming feeling.<br><br>The 13 km-long Bulyeongsa Valley is also found around Bulyeongsa Temple.

The city of Goryeong played such a central role in the development of the confederacy that many artifacts and historic sites of the Daegaya period can still be found there today. <br><br>Some of the most prominent landmarks are the 200 gobuns (ancient tombs) that lie along the southeastern slope of Jusan Mountain in Goryeong. In ancient times, the higher and larger a tomb, the higher the social status of the person buried inside. Given this tradition and historical evidence, the largest tomb in the south has been identified as Geumnim Wangneung (Royal Tomb of King Geumnim); the other large tombs are also presumed to be those of the kings of Daegaya. The large royal tombs (over 20m in diameter) dominate the mountain ridge (the highest point) while mid-sized and smaller tombs can be found on the mountain slopes and foothills. <br><br>Historical research on Daegaya began with the excavation and partial identification of the ancient tombs of Goryeong by research teams from Kyungpook National University and Keimyung University in 1977. Excavators discovered a great number of relics—gilt-bronze crowns, swords, armor, and trinkets of gold, silver, and jade—that shed light on the flourishing culture of Gaya. <br><br>To continue to encourage interest in the history and culture of Daegaya, officials of Goryeong-gun County established the Daegaya Royal Tomb Exhibit Hall at the foot of Jusan Mountain in Gobun-gun, Jisan-dong. The exhibition hall depicts the social structure of the era through ancient customs such as burying servants alive with their dead masters.","regDate":"2022-12-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-12-1670820019777/1004711_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-12-1670820019777"},{"id":"2022-12-12-1670816415461","title":"Jikjisa Temple (직지사)","description":"Jikjisa Temple, located at the foot of Hwangaksan Mountain in Gimcheon, Gyeongsangbuk-do, was constructed in 418, during the second year of Silla Kingdom King Nuljis reign.
