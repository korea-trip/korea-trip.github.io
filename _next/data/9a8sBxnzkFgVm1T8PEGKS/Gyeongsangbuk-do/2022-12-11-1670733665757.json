Dosanseodang area consists of living quarters and lecture halls where Toegye Yi Hwang, an eminent Confucian scholar, lived and taught his students. Dosanseowon was built after Toegye Yi Hwang passed away by his followers in legacy of his teachings as well as to pay respects to the deceased. <br><br>Built in 1561, Dosanseodang lecture hall is the oldest building in the whole complex. It was personally designed by Yi Hwang, penname Toegye, to further his studies while educating future scholars after moving to the countryside. Living quarters used as a student dormitory were also built along with the lecture hall. <br><br>Dosanseowon compound was completed in 1576, six years after Yi Hwangs death. Yi Hwangs ancestral tablet was enshrined inside Sangdeoksa Shrine (Treasure No. 211) in 1572. Two years later, Jeongyodang Lecture Hall (Treasure No. 210) was built to relocate the tablet and with the addition of buildings to the halls east and west, the area became a seowon. In 1575, the establishment was bestowed a royal charter and a plaque with the name Dosanseowon written by Han Seok-bong, and became the Confucian academy headquarters in the Yeongnam region.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> •For more info +82-54-840-6599|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Summer 09:00-18:00<br>Winter 09:00-17:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals – Adults 1,500 won / Teenagers 700 won / Children 600 won<br> Groups – Adults 1,300 won / Teenagers 600 won / Children 500 won<br><br>* Groups - 30 people or more<BR> * Adults (ages 20 and older)|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Available in English (advance inquiry required)|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-11-1670733665757/2620848_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-11-1670733665757/2620848_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-11-1670733665757/2620850_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-11-1670733665757/2620850_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-11-1670733665757/2620851_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-11-1670733665757/2620851_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-11-1670733665757/2620852_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-11-1670733665757/2620852_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-11-1670733665757/2635199_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-11-1670733665757/2635199_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-11-1670733665757/2635201_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-11-1670733665757/2635201_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-11-1670733665757/2622281_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-11-1670733665757/2622281_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-54-840-6599](tel:+82548406599)\n- [🏠www.dosanseowon.com](http://www.dosanseowon.com/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.7270437877\nlongitude: 128.8425024340\ntitle: 154, Dosanseowon-gil, Andong-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-11-1670733665757","title":"Dosanseowon Confucian Academy [UNESCO World Heritage] (도산서원 [유네스코 세계문화유산])","description":"In terms of architecture, Dosanseowon Confucian Academy complex can largely be divided into Dosanseodang compound and Dosanseowon compound.

The park is quite small, filling in an area of just 105.582 ㎢ but is great for a leisure walk with walking trails in place along the valleys up to waterfalls.<br><br>Juwangsan Mountain was called Seokbyeongsan Mountain during the Silla dynasty due to the many stone peaks jutting out, but has been called Juwangsan Mountain since the Unified Silla period.

The city of Goryeong played such a central role in the development of the confederacy that many artifacts and historic sites of the Daegaya period can still be found there today. <br><br>Some of the most prominent landmarks are the 200 gobuns (ancient tombs) that lie along the southeastern slope of Jusan Mountain in Goryeong. In ancient times, the higher and larger a tomb, the higher the social status of the person buried inside. Given this tradition and historical evidence, the largest tomb in the south has been identified as Geumnim Wangneung (Royal Tomb of King Geumnim); the other large tombs are also presumed to be those of the kings of Daegaya. The large royal tombs (over 20m in diameter) dominate the mountain ridge (the highest point) while mid-sized and smaller tombs can be found on the mountain slopes and foothills. <br><br>Historical research on Daegaya began with the excavation and partial identification of the ancient tombs of Goryeong by research teams from Kyungpook National University and Keimyung University in 1977. Excavators discovered a great number of relics—gilt-bronze crowns, swords, armor, and trinkets of gold, silver, and jade—that shed light on the flourishing culture of Gaya. <br><br>To continue to encourage interest in the history and culture of Daegaya, officials of Goryeong-gun County established the Daegaya Royal Tomb Exhibit Hall at the foot of Jusan Mountain in Gobun-gun, Jisan-dong. The exhibition hall depicts the social structure of the era through ancient customs such as burying servants alive with their dead masters.","regDate":"2022-12-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-12-1670820019777/1004711_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-12-1670820019777"},{"id":"2022-12-12-1670816415461","title":"Jikjisa Temple (직지사)","description":"Jikjisa Temple, located at the foot of Hwangaksan Mountain in Gimcheon, Gyeongsangbuk-do, was constructed in 418, during the second year of Silla Kingdom King Nuljis reign.
