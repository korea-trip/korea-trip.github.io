The peak is so broad that 50 adults can sit on it at the same time. Among the rocks there is Seokcheon Pond, which never dries up. The peak used to be called ‚ÄúUnjangdae‚Äù because the summit is always covered with clouds and mist. Legend says that King Sejo of Joseon dynasty supposedly recited a poem on the summit. <br> <br> Munjangdae has a great view of Cheonhwangbong Peak, the highest peak of Songnisan Mountain. Visitors can also see Gwaneumbong, Chilseongbong, Sirubong, Tugubong, Munsubong, and Birobong peaks. In autumn, visitors can enjoy views of breathtaking fall foliage along the trail, which begins at Hwabuk-myeon, Sangju. There are also many cultural heritage sites including Janggakpokpo Falls, Seongbuksa Temple, Osongpokpo Falls and Gyeonhwonsanseong Fortress.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-43-542-5267,<br>+82-54-533-3389|\n|parking:|Available (Osong parking lot)|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restricted Mountain Areas :|[hiking.kworks.co.kr](http://hiking.kworks.co.kr/sub_map/map_user01.aspx)|\n|Areas Open to the Public:|Beopju Ticket office - Sesimjeong -  Sinseondae (6.1 km)<br> Osong area - Munjangdae (3.5 km) <br> Sesimjeong - Dohwa-ri (8.5 km) <br> Janggakdong - Cheonwangbong Peak - Munjangdae (6.5 km) <br> Sadam-ri - Nagyeongsan Mountain - Domyeongsan Mountain (6.5 km) <br> Haksodae - Cheomseongdae (6 km) <br> Sesimjeong - Munjangdae (3.3 km)<br> Cheonwangbong Peak - Hyeongjebong Peak (7.1 km)<br> Sogeumgang River - Gunjasan Mountain - Domagol Valley (6.5 km) <br> Tteokbawi Rock - Chilbosan Mountain - Ssanggokpokpo Falls (6.2 km) <br> Jeolmal - Ssanggokpokpo Falls - Jangseongbong Peak - Jesurijae (12 km) <br> Birosanjang Cottage - Sanggoam (1.2 km) <br> Seonnyubong Peak - Jebiso (1.8 km) <br> Hyeongjebong Peak - Mansu-ri (2.5 km) <br> Ungyo-ri - Gallon (2.8 km)|\n|Mountain Not Access Period:|- Walking Trails Closure<br>Spring: March 2 - April 30<br>Autumn: November 15 - December 15<br><br>* TBD by park directors based on fire weather advisories, snow/precipitation levels, and other local conditions.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Hwabuk Tourist Information Center, Hwabuk Park Office|\n|Parking Fees:|Small cars: 2,000 won<br>Mid-sized cars: 4,000~5,000 won<br>Buses: 6,000~7,500 won|\n|Admission Fees:|Beopjusa Temple admission fee|\n  \n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-43-542-5267](tel:+82435425267)\n- [üè†songni.knps.or.kr](http://songni.knps.or.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.5939740089\nlongitude: 127.8569080064\ntitle: Hwabuk-myeon, Sangju-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \nFrom Dong \nSeoul Bus Terminal, take an intercity bus to Songnisan Mt.

The city of Goryeong played such a central role in the development of the confederacy that many artifacts and historic sites of the Daegaya period can still be found there today. <br><br>Some of the most prominent landmarks are the 200 gobuns (ancient tombs) that lie along the southeastern slope of Jusan Mountain in Goryeong. In ancient times, the higher and larger a tomb, the higher the social status of the person buried inside. Given this tradition and historical evidence, the largest tomb in the south has been identified as Geumnim Wangneung (Royal Tomb of King Geumnim); the other large tombs are also presumed to be those of the kings of Daegaya. The large royal tombs (over 20m in diameter) dominate the mountain ridge (the highest point) while mid-sized and smaller tombs can be found on the mountain slopes and foothills. <br><br>Historical research on Daegaya began with the excavation and partial identification of the ancient tombs of Goryeong by research teams from Kyungpook National University and Keimyung University in 1977. Excavators discovered a great number of relics‚Äîgilt-bronze crowns, swords, armor, and trinkets of gold, silver, and jade‚Äîthat shed light on the flourishing culture of Gaya. <br><br>To continue to encourage interest in the history and culture of Daegaya, officials of Goryeong-gun County established the Daegaya Royal Tomb Exhibit Hall at the foot of Jusan Mountain in Gobun-gun, Jisan-dong. The exhibition hall depicts the social structure of the era through ancient customs such as burying servants alive with their dead masters.","regDate":"2022-12-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-12-1670820019777/1004711_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-12-1670820019777"},{"id":"2022-12-12-1670816415461","title":"Jikjisa Temple (ÏßÅÏßÄÏÇ¨)","description":"Jikjisa Temple, located at the foot of Hwangaksan Mountain in Gimcheon, Gyeongsangbuk-do, was constructed in 418, during the second year of Silla Kingdom King Nuljis reign.
