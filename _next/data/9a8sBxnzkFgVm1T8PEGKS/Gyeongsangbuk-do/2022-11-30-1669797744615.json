The mountain features deep valleys and many sheer rock cliffs to make it the third largest rocky mountain in the country. Juwangsan Mountain was recognized as a tourist attraction on May 30, 1972 and became the 12th national park a few years later on March 30, 1976. The park is quite small, filling in an area of just 105.582 ㎢ but is great for a leisure walk with walking trails in place along the valleys up to waterfalls.<br><br>Juwangsan Mountain was called Seokbyeongsan Mountain during the Silla dynasty due to the many stone peaks jutting out, but has been called Juwangsan Mountain since the Unified Silla period. In addition to these tall rocky peaks, Juwangsan National Park also includes four waterfalls, caves, Daejeonsa Temple and other attractions for a comprehensive tourist site.","regDate":"2022-12-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Nature","Natural Sites","National Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-12-1670834455736/2370090_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-12-1670834455736"},{"id":"2022-12-12-1670827294557","title":"Jugam Pebble Beach [National Geopark] (죽암 몽돌해안 (울릉도, 독도 국가지질공원))","description":"Jugam Pebble Beach, located on Ulleungdo Island, is approximatly 500 meters long and 20 meters wide and has round pebbles weathered by the fierce waves.

The city of Goryeong played such a central role in the development of the confederacy that many artifacts and historic sites of the Daegaya period can still be found there today. <br><br>Some of the most prominent landmarks are the 200 gobuns (ancient tombs) that lie along the southeastern slope of Jusan Mountain in Goryeong. In ancient times, the higher and larger a tomb, the higher the social status of the person buried inside. Given this tradition and historical evidence, the largest tomb in the south has been identified as Geumnim Wangneung (Royal Tomb of King Geumnim); the other large tombs are also presumed to be those of the kings of Daegaya. The large royal tombs (over 20m in diameter) dominate the mountain ridge (the highest point) while mid-sized and smaller tombs can be found on the mountain slopes and foothills. <br><br>Historical research on Daegaya began with the excavation and partial identification of the ancient tombs of Goryeong by research teams from Kyungpook National University and Keimyung University in 1977. Excavators discovered a great number of relics—gilt-bronze crowns, swords, armor, and trinkets of gold, silver, and jade—that shed light on the flourishing culture of Gaya. <br><br>To continue to encourage interest in the history and culture of Daegaya, officials of Goryeong-gun County established the Daegaya Royal Tomb Exhibit Hall at the foot of Jusan Mountain in Gobun-gun, Jisan-dong. The exhibition hall depicts the social structure of the era through ancient customs such as burying servants alive with their dead masters.","regDate":"2022-12-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-12-1670820019777/1004711_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-12-1670820019777"},{"id":"2022-12-12-1670816415461","title":"Jikjisa Temple (직지사)","description":"Jikjisa Temple, located at the foot of Hwangaksan Mountain in Gimcheon, Gyeongsangbuk-do, was constructed in 418, during the second year of Silla Kingdom King Nuljis reign.
