The elaborately decorated tomb is second in grandeur only to those of royalty.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢  For more info: +82-54-749-6713|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|March-October 09:00-18:00<br>November-February 09:00-17:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 2,000 won / Teenagers 1,000 won / Children 500 won<br>Groups - Adults 1,600 won / Teenagers 800 won / Children 400 won|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-29-1669707348320/179564_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-29-1669707348320/179564_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-29-1669707348320/1200482_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-29-1669707348320/1200482_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-29-1669707348320/1200483_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-29-1669707348320/1200483_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-29-1669707348320/1200485_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-29-1669707348320/1200485_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-29-1669707348320/1613371_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-29-1669707348320/1613371_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-29-1669707348320/1613372_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-29-1669707348320/1613372_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-29-1669707348320/1613373_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-29-1669707348320/1613373_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-29-1669707348320/1613375_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-29-1669707348320/1613375_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-29-1669707348320/1613376_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-29-1669707348320/1613376_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-29-1669707348320/1613374_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-29-1669707348320/1613374_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-54-749-6713](tel:+82547496713)\n- [üè†www.gyeongju.go.kr/tour](https://www.gyeongju.go.kr/tour/page.do?cmd=2&mnu_uid=2296&area_uid=144)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.8453311317\nlongitude: 129.1923886866\ntitle: 44-7, Chunghyo 2-gil, Gyeongju-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-29-1669707348320","title":"Gyeongju Tomb of Kim Yu-sin (Í≤ΩÏ£º ÍπÄÏú†Ïã†Î¨ò)","description":"The tomb of General Kim Yu-sin (595-673) is located near the Gyeongju Express Bus Terminal at the end of a scenic lane, popular in spring for its walls of yellow forsythia and pink cherry blossom trees in bloom.

The city of Goryeong played such a central role in the development of the confederacy that many artifacts and historic sites of the Daegaya period can still be found there today. <br><br>Some of the most prominent landmarks are the 200 gobuns (ancient tombs) that lie along the southeastern slope of Jusan Mountain in Goryeong. In ancient times, the higher and larger a tomb, the higher the social status of the person buried inside. Given this tradition and historical evidence, the largest tomb in the south has been identified as Geumnim Wangneung (Royal Tomb of King Geumnim); the other large tombs are also presumed to be those of the kings of Daegaya. The large royal tombs (over 20m in diameter) dominate the mountain ridge (the highest point) while mid-sized and smaller tombs can be found on the mountain slopes and foothills. <br><br>Historical research on Daegaya began with the excavation and partial identification of the ancient tombs of Goryeong by research teams from Kyungpook National University and Keimyung University in 1977. Excavators discovered a great number of relics‚Äîgilt-bronze crowns, swords, armor, and trinkets of gold, silver, and jade‚Äîthat shed light on the flourishing culture of Gaya. <br><br>To continue to encourage interest in the history and culture of Daegaya, officials of Goryeong-gun County established the Daegaya Royal Tomb Exhibit Hall at the foot of Jusan Mountain in Gobun-gun, Jisan-dong. The exhibition hall depicts the social structure of the era through ancient customs such as burying servants alive with their dead masters.","regDate":"2022-12-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-12-1670820019777/1004711_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-12-1670820019777"},{"id":"2022-12-12-1670816415461","title":"Jikjisa Temple (ÏßÅÏßÄÏÇ¨)","description":"Jikjisa Temple, located at the foot of Hwangaksan Mountain in Gimcheon, Gyeongsangbuk-do, was constructed in 418, during the second year of Silla Kingdom King Nuljis reign.
