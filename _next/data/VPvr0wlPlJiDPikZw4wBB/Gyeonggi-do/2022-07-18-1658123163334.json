It sits atop a hill east of Hwahongmun Gate and offers beautiful views of the surrounding scenery. For this reason, the pavilion received the nickname Banghwasuryujeong, meaning a pavilion where one can \"find flowers and stroll among willow trees.\" The pavilion was once damaged due to flooding and reconstructed in 1848, followed by continuous recovery and preservation efforts. In 2011, the pavilion was designated as Treasure No. 1709. Banghwasuryujeong Pavilion is evaluated as one of the most original architectures in Hwaseong for its unique composition and roof design that offer a different look depending on the viewer's angle. Known to be the spot where King Jeongjo would stop by to rest on his way to Hwaseong Fortress, the pavilion offers a bird's-eye-view of Yeonmudae Post to the east and Janganmun Gate to the west with Paldalsan Mountain in the background.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-31-228-4672|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Open 24 hr|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-18-1658123163334/2404799_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-18-1658123163334/2404799_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-18-1658123163334/2404800_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-18-1658123163334/2404800_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-18-1658123163334/2404801_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-18-1658123163334/2404801_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-18-1658123163334/2514372_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-18-1658123163334/2514372_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-18-1658123163334/2514374_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-18-1658123163334/2514374_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-31-228-4672](tel:+82312284672)\n- [üè†www.suwon.go.kr](https://www.suwon.go.kr/web/visitsuwon/index.do)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.2876178712\nlongitude: 127.0180363861\ntitle: 44-6, Suwoncheon-ro 392beon-gil, Paldal-gu, Suwon-si, Gyeonggi-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-18-1658123163334","title":"Banghwasuryujeong Pavilion (Î∞©ÌôîÏàòÎ•òÏ†ï(ÎèôÎ∂ÅÍ∞ÅÎ£®))","description":"Banghwasuryujeong Pavilion, officially called Dongbukgangnu Pavilion, was built in 1794 during the construction of Suwon Hwaseong Fortress.

She would grow up to be the wife of the dynasty‚Äôs 26th ruler, King Gojong. The birthplace and the adjoining Memorial Hall are open to the public. <br>Empress Myeongseong was a brilliant diplomat who pursued openness and reform to maintain the sovereignty of the nation. Unfortunately, her tumultuous life came to an end in the early morning hours of October 8, 1895 when she was murdered by the Japanese army. <br><br>During Japanese colonial rule, the empress was wrongfully accused of being a jealous and overly ambitious person. Studies of various archives have since revealed what a great person she really was. Recently, numerous television productions and musicals have also corrected those misunderstandings. Renovated in 1995, her birthplace includes three buildings with servants‚Äô quarters, master‚Äôs quarters, and a separate house. A commemorative monument now stands at the site of the room where the empress studied as a child. The Memorial Hall in front of the house contains various archives and artifacts related to Empress Myeongseong‚Äôs life. There is also a 161-seat theater.","regDate":"2022-07-18","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Birthplaces"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-18-1658137022392/184956_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-07-18-1658137022392"},{"id":"2022-07-18-1658133794770","title":"Bigeumgyegok Valley (ÎπÑÍ∏àÍ≥ÑÍ≥°)","description":"Bigeumgyegok Valley is also known as ‚ÄúMulgolan‚Äù (literally meaning inside water valley), as clean water flows abundantly in this area.
