The combination of an expansive sandy beach and indigo blue waters of the East Sea creates a splendid view, drawing a large number of vacationers in the summer. <br><br>Hupohang Port is the main receiving and distributing port for fish caught in the East Sea. In the early morning, the port offers a great chance to not only see fish being hauled from boats to the fish market, but also to purchase fresh raw fish at an affordable price. On the hill north of Hupo Beach stands Hupo Lighthouse where one can get an unobstructed view of the East Sea and the Uljin area. Hupo Beach is one of the few beaches offering a splendid view of both the port and the lighthouse.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-54-789-6851|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Film Locations:|Drama \"You and I (1997)\"|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Shower booths, campground|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-01-1669887472229/187426_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-01-1669887472229/187426_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-01-1669887472229/202363_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-01-1669887472229/202363_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-01-1669887472229/202371_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-01-1669887472229/202371_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-54-789-6851](tel:+82547896851)\n- [🏠www.uljin.go.kr](http://www.uljin.go.kr/tour/index.uljin)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.6750445745\nlongitude: 129.4420091571\ntitle: Samyul-ri, Uljin-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-01-1669887472229","title":"Hupo Beach (후포해수욕장)","description":"The 250-meter-long Hupo Beach is situated right by Hupohang Port.
