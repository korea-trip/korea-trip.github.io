The cone is comprised of a mix of volanic rock and soil, and in comparison with other oreum, was formed rather recently. Volcanic cones are formed when magma from the main volcano seeps out of weaker points in the surrounding area, and can be considered small volcanos. Yongnunioreum is covered in a lush carpet of grass, and is home to many wildflowers. The name of the cone comes from its shape resembling a dragon laying down.","regDate":"2023-02-19","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-19-1676777923898/1771329_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-19-1676777923898"},{"id":"2023-02-18-1676716610183","title":"Yongcheondonggul Cave [UNESCO World Natural Heritage Site] (Ïö©Ï≤úÎèôÍµ¥ [Ïú†ÎÑ§Ïä§ÏΩî ÏÑ∏Í≥ÑÏûêÏó∞Ïú†ÏÇ∞])","description":"Yongcheondonggul Cave is the most typical form of lava tunnel on Jeju Island and with a total length of approximately 2,470 meters, it is one of the largest.

In particular, a range of carbonate formations such as straw soda, stalactite, columns, flowstones, cave corals, and aragonite crystals can be found inside this large cave that also contains a lake. This unique cave is astounding in terms of its geological value and beauty. There are also items that can be found throughout the cave that appear to have been brought in by people who lived on the island long ago, such as pieces of pottery, animal bones, ironware, charcoal and other substances.<br><br>* The UNESCO World Heritage inscribed Geomunoreum Lava Tube System consists of Bengdwigul, Manjanggul, Gimnyeonggul, Yongcheondonggul and Dangcheomuldonggul Caves.","regDate":"2023-02-18","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-18-1676716610183"},{"id":"2023-02-18-1676712970362","title":"Ssangyonggul Cave (Hallim Park) (ÏåçÏö©Íµ¥ (ÌïúÎ¶ºÍ≥µÏõê))","description":"Ssangyonggul Cave, a designated Natural Monument, is one of the representative lava tubes of Jeju Island along with Hwanggeumgul, Socheongul, and Manjanggul caves. The cave measures approximately 400 meters in length, 6 meters in x_width, and 3 meters in x_height. It is thought to have been created by lava that erupted from Hallasan Mountain some 25 million years ago. <br><br>One of the unique features of this particular cave is that it has features of both a lava tube and a limestone cave. The entire area surrounding the cave is a huge stratum of seashells and sand, while the interior is a mystical mix of stalactites and stalagmites. Lime covers the cave walls in a series of natural swirls and streaks, bringing to mind the strokes of an abstract painting. Since the cave stays at a constant 17-18‚ÑÉ throughout the year, it‚Äôs a welcome escape from the heat in the summer and a great place to warm up in the winter. <br><br>The cave gets its name from its two branches, which are said to look like the paths of two dragons (‚ÄòSsangyong‚Äô meaning ‚Äòtwo dragons‚Äô in Korean). It is thought that Ssangyonggul Cave and Hyeopjaegul Cave were once one cave since the second entrance of Ssangyonggul Cave is so close to the end of Hyeopjaegul Cave.","regDate":"2023-02-18","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-18-1676712970362/218751_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-18-1676712970362"},{"id":"2023-02-18-1676709536401","title":"Snoopy Garden (Ïä§ÎàÑÌîºÍ∞ÄÎì†)","description":"Snoopy Garden House is where visitors can meet Snoopy and friends from the popular American comic series Peanuts.

The three princesses brought with them a calf, pony, and five different seeds that eventually helped to establish agriculture in Jeju.<br><br> Curiously, the three holes are not percolated by rain or snow.
