{"pageProps":{"content":"![Daegu Gyesan Catholic Church (대구 계산동성당)](/2022-07-13-1657726959201/2642032_image2_1.webp)\n  \n## Overview\n\n> The Daegu Gyesan Catholic Church was built by Father Robert, A.P. (1853-1922), who came to Daegu for missionary work. In 1899, the church building was constructed with wood using a Korean-style design, but was destroyed by fire a few months after construction began. Father Robert created a new building design and imported stained glass and galvanized iron from France and Hong Kong, since these types of building materials were hard to find in Korea. Construction was finally completed in 1902, three years after the project first started.\n<br><br>\nThis church is the only remaining structure in Daegu from the early 1900s. The church building is designed in the shape of a Latin cross, consisting of a nave and transept. This predominantly Romanesque church also features some Gothic architectural elements such as the stained-glass windows and pinnacles.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<BR> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-53-254-2300|\n|parking:|Available|\n|usetime:|[Mass schedule] <br>Saturday - Special mass 16:00, 19:30 / Regular mass 06:30<br>Sundays - 06:30, 08:00, 09:30, 11:00, 17:00, 18:30, 20:00, 21:30<br>Mondays - 06:30<br>Tuesday-Friday 0:30, 11:30, 19:30|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-13-1657726959201/1026129_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-13-1657726959201/1026129_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-13-1657726959201/1763762_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-13-1657726959201/1763762_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-13-1657726959201/2050629_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-13-1657726959201/2050629_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-13-1657726959201/2050633_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-13-1657726959201/2050633_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-13-1657726959201/2050634_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-13-1657726959201/2050634_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-13-1657726959201/2050635_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-13-1657726959201/2050635_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-13-1657726959201/2050636_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-13-1657726959201/2050636_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-53-254-2300](tel:+82532542300)\n- [🏠www.kyesan.org](http://www.kyesan.org/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.8679756281\nlongitude: 128.5877689624\ntitle: 10, Seoseong-ro, Jung-gu, Daegu\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway]<BR>\nBanwoldang Station (Daegu Subway Line 1 or 2), Exit 18.<br>\nGo straight about 300 m and turn right at the Gyesan 5-way Intersection.<br>\nGo straight for approx. 170 m to arrive at the Daegu Gyesan Catholic Church on the right.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-13-1657726959201","title":"Daegu Gyesan Catholic Church (대구 계산동성당)","description":"The Daegu Gyesan Catholic Church was built by Father Robert, A.P.
