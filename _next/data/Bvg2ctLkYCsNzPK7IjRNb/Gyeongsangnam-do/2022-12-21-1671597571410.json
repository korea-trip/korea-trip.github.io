The reinforced stonewall has a circumference of approximately 1,760 meters, 5-8 meters in x_height and contains three wells and springs. According to Ha Ryun’s Seongmungi in Donggukyeojiseungnam Record, the fortress was frequently destroyed during invasions and was reinforced by Jinju’s minister, Kim Jung-gwang during the fifth year of Goryeo Woo King’s reign (1379). During this period, the circumference was 800 bo(pace), with Uijeongmun Gate to the east, Jijemun Gate to the north, and Yehwamun Gate to the south. Outside the castle, Cheongcheon River flows in the west, Namgang River in the south and a pond lies between the castle and the trench dug during the war times. As a fortress to safeguard from attacks, it blocked enemies from advancing toward Honam during the 25th year of Joseon Seonjo King’s reign (1592). Within the fortress lies Chokseoknu, Kim Shi-min Memorial, Uigisa Shrine, Seojangdae, Bukjangdae, Changyeolsa shrine, Jinju National Museum, Hoguksa Temple, and an outdoor stage.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-55-749-5170|\n|parking:|Available<br>- Gongbukmun Parking (large-sized parking: 9 spaces / small-sized parking: 26 spaces)<br>- Health Center Parking Lot (small-sized parking: 84 spaces)<br>- Jinjuseong Fortress Tour Bus Parking Lot (tour bus parking: 14 spaces)|\n|usetime:|Ticketing Office 09:00-18:00<BR>March-October 05:00-23:00<BR>November-February 05:00-22:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 2,000 won / Teenagers 1,000 won / Children 600 won<br>Groups - Adults 1,400 won / Teenagers 600 won / Children 400 won<br> * Group: 30 or more people<BR>* Free admission: Preschoolers (ages 7 and yonger), senior citizens (ages 65 and older)|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|[Main facilities]<br>Chokseoknu Pavilion, Uiam Rock, Uigisa Pavilion, Imjindaecheop Gyesasunuidan, Statue of General Kim Si-min, Patriotic Bell, Chokseokjeongchungdanbi Monument, Ssangchungsajeokbi Monument, Yeongnam Pojeongsa Pavilion, Gongbukmun Gate, Bukjangdae, Jinju National Museum, Poru, Seojangdae, outdoor stage, Changryeolsa Temple, Hoguksa Temple|\n|Parking Fees:|Small-sized cars: 500 won for first 30-min / 200 won for each additional 10-min<br>Large-sized cars: 1,000 won for the first 30-min / 400 won for each additional-10 min<br>* Free parking fee at the tour bus parking lot of Jinjuseong Fortress|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-21-1671597571410/211697_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-21-1671597571410/211697_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-21-1671597571410/1611507_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-21-1671597571410/1611507_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-21-1671597571410/1611508_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-21-1671597571410/1611508_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-21-1671597571410/1611509_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-21-1671597571410/1611509_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-21-1671597571410/1611510_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-21-1671597571410/1611510_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-21-1671597571410/1951251_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-21-1671597571410/1951251_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-21-1671597571410/211695_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-21-1671597571410/211695_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-21-1671597571410/211698_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-21-1671597571410/211698_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-21-1671597571410/212350_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-21-1671597571410/212350_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-21-1671597571410/2367487_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-21-1671597571410/2367487_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-55-749-5170](tel:+82557495170)\n- [🏠www.jinju.go.kr](http://www.jinju.go.kr/tour.web)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.1897457534\nlongitude: 128.0802763856\ntitle: 626, Namgang-ro, Jinju-si, Gyeongsangnam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>\nFrom  Jinju Intercity Bus Terminal, walk for approx. 10-15 min.\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-21-1671597571410","title":"Jinjuseong Fortress (진주성)","description":"Jinjuseong Fortress, which is historically linked to the Imjin War (1592-1598), was originally named Geoyeolseong Fortress during the Three Kingdom Period, later renamed as Chokseokseong Fortress in the Goryeo dynasty and finally settled as Jinjuseong Fortress in the Joseon dynasty.
