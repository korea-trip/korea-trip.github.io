It marks the boundary between Jeollanam-do, South Jeolla Province (Wolgye-ri, Yong-myeon, the most northern town in Damyang-gun) and Jeollabuk-do, North Jeolla Province (Bokheung-myeon, Sunchang-gun). The mountain has a dense forest, rock formations and stones, and rock walls that look like manmade fortifications with a narrow path to the west which can accommodate only one person at a time.<br> <br> Shaped like a Buddhist monk lying down when it is seen from Damyang-eups side, it is popular for its various naturally grown medicinal herbs as well as rare kinds of Chuwolsan orchids. The base of the mountain has gentle slopes and densely packed old pine trees, making it the best destination for families in summer. The hiking trail is hard to climb despite the fact that the peak is not very high. However, it is visited by mountain climbers all year long.<br> <br> Before reaching Sangbong Peak, there is a hermitage and a mineral spring that never dries up. The peak also boasts an impressive view of the surrounding area, including Damyangho Lake. Chuwolsan Mountain was a battle site during the Imjin War along with the nearby Geumseongsanseong Fortress. The last battle of Donghak Peasant Revolution also took place at Chuwolsan Mountain.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-61-380-2794|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Mountain Not Access Period:|Seasonal Forest Fire Prevention Period<br>Spring: March 2-April 30 <br>Autumn: November 1-December 15<brNational Park: November 15-December 15 (Excluding Gyeongju and Taean)<br>* TBD by park directors based on fire weather advisories, snow/precipitation levels, and other local conditions.|\n|Restricted Mountain Areas :|[Refer to the website.](http://hiking.kworks.co.kr/sub_map/map_user01.aspx)|\n|Hiking Course:|2.5 km course: Parking lot - cave in front of Boriam Jungsubi - Boriam Hermitage - Chuwolsan Mountain peak |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-15-1673778948090/2013989_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-15-1673778948090/2013989_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-61-380-3492](tel:+82613803492)\n- [üè†tour.damyang.go.kr](http://tour.damyang.go.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.4044109106\nlongitude: 126.9923139649\ntitle: 981, Chuwolsan-ro, Damyang-gun, Jeollanam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \nFrom the Seoul Express Bus Terminal or Dong Seoul Terminal, take the bus to Damyang Terminal.<br>\nLocal bus to Chuwolsan Mountain operates 12 times a day.
