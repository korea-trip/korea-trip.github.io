Visitors can enjoy a comfortable walk through the trees on a trail that winds through the heart of the forest.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Korea Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-31-771-7166|\n|opendate:|1991|\n|useseason:|March-November|\n|usetime:|[Daily] 09:00-18:00<br>[Accommodation] Check in - From 15:00 / Check out - 12:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Accommodations<BR>Convenience facilities - walking trail, hiking trail, forest park. etc. <br> Education facilities - Forest experience course<br>Sports facility - playground <br>Drinking fountain|\n|Facility Utilization Fees:|[Accommodations] <BR>Forest Cabin: 46,000~184,000 won<br>Lodging Complex: 77,000~134,000 won <BR>Camping Facility: 6,000~8,500 won<BR>* For detailed information, check the official website|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-29-1661769914101/607979_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661769914101/607979_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-29-1661769914101/607983_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661769914101/607983_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-29-1661769914101/607987_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661769914101/607987_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-29-1661769914101/607992_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661769914101/607992_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-29-1661769914101/608001_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661769914101/608001_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-29-1661769914101/608005_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661769914101/608005_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-29-1661769914101/608009_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661769914101/608009_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-29-1661769914101/608018_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661769914101/608018_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-29-1661769914101/1589830_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661769914101/1589830_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-29-1661769914101/607974_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661769914101/607974_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-31-771-7166](tel:+82317717166)\n- [🏠www.foresttrip.go.kr](https://www.foresttrip.go.kr/indvz/main.do?hmpgId=0108)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5818000399\nlongitude: 127.4571548101\ntitle: 1152, Jungmisan-ro, Yangpyeong-gun, Gyeonggi-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-29-1661769914101","title":"Jungmisan Recreational Forest (중미산자연휴양림)","description":"Jungmisan Recreational Forest unfolds at the end of a lovely drive along the famous Nongdachigogae Road, the highest ridge road in the vicinity of Seoul.
