The name of the cave, \"Sagul,\" comes from the snake-like formation of the cave (\"sa\" meaning serpent). The entrance of the cave is wide like a serpent holding its mouth wide open, but once inside, the tunnel narrows resembling the body of a snake. Gimnyeongsagul Cave is a highly protected area and has been designated as Natural Monument No. 98 along with Manjanggul Cave.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>• For more info: +82-1600-0064|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-20-1658293234896/1618232_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-20-1658293234896/1618232_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-20-1658293234896/1618234_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-20-1658293234896/1618234_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-20-1658293234896/1618235_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-20-1658293234896/1618235_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-20-1658293234896/1618236_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-20-1658293234896/1618236_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-1600-0064](tel:+8216000064)\n- [🏠www.cha.go.kr](http://www.cha.go.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.5435239811\nlongitude: 126.7749669662\ntitle: 34, Manjanggul-gil, Jeju-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-20-1658293234896","title":"Gimnyeongsagul Cave [UNESCO World Heritage] (김녕사굴 [유네스코 세계자연유산])","description":"Gimnyeongsagul Cave is located close to Manjanggul Cave in the northeastern part of Jeju Island.
