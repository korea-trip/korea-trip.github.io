Depending on the tides, Oryukdo (“O” meaning “5”, “Yuk” meaning “6”) sometimes looks as if it is made of five or six islets. Several decades after the Busanhang Port opened (1876), a lighthouse was built (November 1937) in Batseom Island of Oryukdo to guide ships traveling to and from the island. Initially only 6.2 meters high, the lighthouse underwent renovations (completed in December 1998) and now stands tall at 27.5 meters. The lighthouse is home to an exhibition room showing photos of major lighthouses in Korea and boasts a stunning view of Busanhang Port as well as an unforgettable nightscape.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-51-607-6395|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-18-1660791989829/1561576_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-18-1660791989829/1561576_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-51-607-6395](tel:+82516076395)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.0912035523\nlongitude: 129.1269154412\ntitle: 130, Oryukdo-ro, Nam-gu, Busan\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway + Bus]<br>\nKyungsung Univ./Pukyong Nat'l Univ.
