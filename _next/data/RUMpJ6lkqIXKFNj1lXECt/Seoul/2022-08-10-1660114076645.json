{"pageProps":{"content":"![Tapgol Park (탑골공원)](/2022-08-10-1660114076645/2601459_image2_1.webp)\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> Tapgol Park, a designated Historic Site, was the first modern park to be built in Seoul. The park is located at what was originally the site of Wongaksa Temple, built during the 13th year of Joseon King Sejo's reign. However, the temple was destroyed and the site did not become a park until 1897 due to a proposal made by Englishman John Mcleavy Brown, an advisor to King Gojong. The park is also important for being the starting point for the March 1 Independence Movement in Seoul. The original name of the park was Pagoda Park, but was changed to the current Tapgol Park on May 28, 1992. The park contains several monuments and heritages, including the Ten-story Stone Pagoda of Wongaksa Temple Site (National Treasure), Stele for the Construction of Daewongaksa Temple at Wongaksa Temple Site (Treasure), and Palgakjeong Pavilion, where the Independence Proclamation was first declared; the independence movement relief plate; and the statue of Son Byeong-hee.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-2-731-0534|\n|parking:|Not available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Ten-story Stone Pagoda of Wongaksa Temple Site, Palgakjeong Pavilion, independence movement relief plate, statue of Son Byeong-hee, etc.|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-10-1660114076645/2601457_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-10-1660114076645/2601457_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-10-1660114076645/2601458_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-10-1660114076645/2601458_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-10-1660114076645/2601460_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-10-1660114076645/2601460_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-10-1660114076645/2601461_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-10-1660114076645/2601461_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-10-1660114076645/2601462_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-10-1660114076645/2601462_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-2-731-0534](tel:+8227310534)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5710594522\nlongitude: 126.9883005554\ntitle: 99, Jong-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-10-1660114076645","title":"Tapgol Park (탑골공원)","description":"Tapgol Park, a designated Historic Site, was the first modern park to be built in Seoul.
