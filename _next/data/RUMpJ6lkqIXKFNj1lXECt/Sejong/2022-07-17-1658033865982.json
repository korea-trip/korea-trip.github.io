Following this river, there is a red arch-shaped bridge on the right called Bultigyo Bridge. Geumgang Recreational Forest, a large and well-organized forest, is located on the other side of this bridge. In the past, this remote village can only be reached by boat. In 1994, the Chungnam Forest Environment Research Institute moved to this area and designated the well-preserved dense forest as Geumgang Recreational Forest, and the Forest Museum opened in October 1997. Geumgang Recreational Forest is different from other recreational forests. Rather than a dense forest with a trail, this forest has a variety of attractions such as the Forest Museum, an arboretum, greenhouse, pond, and wildlife park scattered on well-maintained roads, giving the impression of a city park.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|accomcount:|2,000 people per day|\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-41-635-7400|\n|opendate:|October 31, 1997|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|Arboretum, Forest Museum, greenhouse: First Wednesday of every month / Forest Cabin, Forest Recreational Hall, campsite: First and third Wednesday & Thursday of every month|\n|usetime:|[Accommodations] Check in 14:00 / Check out 11:00 <br> <br>[Arboretum]<br>March-October 09:00-18:00<br>November-February 09:00-17:00<br<br>* Last admission 1 hour before closing|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Individual: Adults 1,500 won / Teenagers 1,300 won / Children 700 won <br> Group: Adults 1,300 won / Teenagers 1,100 won / Children 500 won<br> <br>* Group: 30 people or more<br> * Free admission: Preschoolers (ages 6 & under), senior citizens (ages 65 & over)|\n|Available Facilities:|The Forest Museum, zoological garden,&nbsp;arboretum, wild flower garden, pond, observatory,  accommodations, grass plaza, hiking trail, water play area, sports facilities, outdoor classroom|\n|Facility Utilization Fees:|Forest Cabin: Low season 56,000~110,000 won / Peak season 76,000~107,000 won<br>Forest Recreational Hall: Low season 56,000~260,000 won / Peak season 76,000~330,000 won<br>Cabin: Low season 35,000 won / Peak season 45,000 won<br> Camping Site: Low season 6,000 won / Peak season 7,000 won|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Compact cars: 1,500 won<br>Small cars: 3,000 won<br>Large vehicles: 5,000 won<br>* Free parking available for Forest Cabin patrons|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-17-1658033865982/1598611_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-17-1658033865982/1598611_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-17-1658033865982/1598612_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-17-1658033865982/1598612_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-17-1658033865982/1598613_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-17-1658033865982/1598613_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-17-1658033865982/1598614_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-17-1658033865982/1598614_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-17-1658033865982/1598615_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-17-1658033865982/1598615_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-17-1658033865982/1598616_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-17-1658033865982/1598616_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-17-1658033865982/1598618_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-17-1658033865982/1598618_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-17-1658033865982/2437978_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-17-1658033865982/2437978_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-17-1658033865982/2437979_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-17-1658033865982/2437979_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-17-1658033865982/2437981_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-17-1658033865982/2437981_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-41-635-7400](tel:+82416357400)\n- [üè†www.keumkang.go.kr](http://www.keumkang.go.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.4354448235\nlongitude: 127.2305767737\ntitle: 110, Sallimbangmulgwan-gil, Sejong-si\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Seoul Nambu Bus Terminal, take an intercity&nbsp;bus to Gongju Bus Terminal.<br>\nFrom Gongju Bus Terminal, take Bus No. 580 and get off at Forest Museum Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-17-1658033865982","title":"Geumgang Recreational Forest (Arboretum, Forest Museum) (Í∏àÍ∞ïÏûêÏó∞Ìú¥ÏñëÎ¶º(Í∏àÍ∞ïÏàòÎ™©Ïõê,ÏÇ∞Î¶ºÎ∞ïÎ¨ºÍ¥Ä))","description":"Along the river from Gongju toward Daejeon there is Geumgang River to the right.
