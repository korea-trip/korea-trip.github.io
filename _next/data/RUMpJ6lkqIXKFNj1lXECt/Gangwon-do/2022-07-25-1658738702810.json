Originally established as Baegamseonwon Temple in 973, the temple changed its name several times, went through construction works, and has become the current Cheongpyeongsa Temple. Yi Ja-hyeon, a scholar of the Goryeo period, built a garden here by keeping its natural topography after he left his government post. In this area, there is a pond that was built during the Goryeo period and has preserved its original form. Many cultural heritages have disappeared over the years and during the Korean War as well. The remaining cultural heritages include Hoejeonmun Gate of Cheongpyeongsa Temple (Treasure No. 164), Three-story Stone Pagoda of Cheongpyeongsa Temple (Gangwon-do Cultural Heritage Material No. 8), and Stupa of Yi Ja-hyeon (posthumous epithet  Jillakgong). Cheongpyeongsa Temple‚Äôs Hoejeonmun Gate was built instead of Sacheonwangmun Gate (the gate of the Four Guardian Kings), in order to enlighten people about the transmigration of souls. Cheongpyeongsa Temple bears a myth about a princess and a serpent. The princess suffered a lot from a serpent as she couldn‚Äôt get rid of it from her body. Then she came to Cheongpyeongsa Temple and prayed to the Buddha, and she became free from the serpent. Therefore, the Three-story Stone Pagoda of Cheongpyeongsa Temple is also called ‚ÄúPrincess Pagoda.‚Äù Although the scale of the temple is not large, it is known for beautiful natural landscape harmonized with artificial structures, such as a pavilion and a pond. Accordingly, the area of the temple was designated as Scenic Site No. 70. Cheongpyeongsa Temple can be also reached by taking a ferry at the Soyanggang Dam Quay.","regDate":"2022-10-22","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-22-1666424746299/1780622_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-22-1666424746299"},{"id":"2022-10-22-1666421910900","title":"Chuam Suspension Bridge (Ï∂îÏïî Ï∂úÎ†ÅÎã§Î¶¨)","description":"Chuam Suspension Bridge is located near Chotdae Rock, famous as a sunrise spot.
