The fortress is about 950 meters in  circumference. The oval \nfortress was built in consideration of the location's topography having a higher terrain in the southern part and a lower terrain in the northern part. Of all the fortresses in Jeju, Byeolbangjin Fortress is in relatively good shape. The fortress is also an important example of how fortresses in Jeju were built and in what scale.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-64-740-6000|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-19-1658220143150/1618272_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658220143150/1618272_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658220143150/1618273_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658220143150/1618273_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658220143150/1618274_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658220143150/1618274_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658220143150/192239_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658220143150/192239_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658220143150/192240_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658220143150/192240_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658220143150/192241_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658220143150/192241_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658220143150/2513544_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658220143150/2513544_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658220143150/2513545_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658220143150/2513545_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658220143150/2513546_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658220143150/2513546_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-19-1658220143150/2513547_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-19-1658220143150/2513547_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-64-740-6000](tel:+82647406000)\n- [üè†visitjeju.net</a> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese, Malay)<br><a href=\"http://www.cha.go.kr/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"New window popup\" class=\"web\">www.cha.go.kr](http://www.visitjeju.net/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.5262082208\nlongitude: 126.8843912035\ntitle: Haemajihaean-ro, Jeju-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Jeju Intercity Bus Terminal, take the East Coast Line (Jeju.

The history of the garden started in 1963 when Seong Beom-yeong, the founder of the garden, came to Jeju and cultivated the wasteland full of rocks. The garden came into the international spotlight as the beautiful space was created from the wastelands by a single farmer. The garden has been visited by many honored public figures such as Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao from China, Nakasone from Japan, Kim Yongsun from North Korea and others. Currently, about 400 planted trees are on display. Also, visitors can see various facilities including stone walls and stone towers stacked with Jeju volcanic stones, the largest artificial waterfall in Jeju, and a pond filled with large carp at the base of the the waterfall.","regDate":"2023-02-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Botanical Gardens"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-13-1676280988564/608548_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-13-1676280988564"},{"id":"2023-02-13-1676277674763","title":"Songaksan Mountain (ÏÜ°ÏïÖÏÇ∞)","description":"Songaksan Mountain is also called 99 Bong (99 Peaks) due to its 99 small peaks.

From the summit, one can see nearby islands such as Marado, Gapado, and Hyeongjeseom, and as far as Hallasan Mountain and the Pacific Ocean. <br><br> The main peak rises 104 meters above sea level. To the northwest of the main peak is an expansive prairie with several peaks. There is a crater about 500 meters in diameter and 80 meters in depth, with some blackish volcanic ash still remaining inside. Looking along the jagged coastline, one can spot the large man-made caves built during the Japanese occupation. The seashore at the base of Songaksan Mountain is a famous fishing ground and diverse fish such as sawedged perch and black porgy are caught here.","regDate":"2023-02-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-13-1676277674763/1620230_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-13-1676277674763"},{"id":"2023-02-13-1676273756670","title":"Someorioreum Volcanic Cone (Udobong Peak) (Ïá†Î®∏Î¶¨Ïò§Î¶Ñ(Ïö∞ÎèÑÎ¥â))","description":"Someorioreum Volcanic Cone is located on Udo Island, about 3.8 kilometers from Seongsanhang Port.
