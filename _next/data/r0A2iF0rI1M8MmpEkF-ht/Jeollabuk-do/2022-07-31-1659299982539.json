The lake and its surrounding mountains were designated a national tourist site in 1985, but remain historically significant as they are featured on Daedongyeojido (Grand Map of Korea), a revered document developed by geographer Kim Jeong-ho. Known for its beauty at night, the lake was befittingly dubbed “Eunpa,” which means “silvery moonlit waves.”<br><br>\n\nEupa Lake Park is full of natural beauty. The road that runs up from the park entrance is lined with cherry trees that create a breathtaking tunnel of pink flowers each spring. This stunning cherry blossom tunnel draws crowds of families and couples each year, particularly on the weekends. Mulbit Bridge, a landmark of the Eunpa tourist site, offers an impressive view of the Music Fountain and nightscape. At the park, you’ll also find an inline skating area, a waterfront stage, and a lotus flower garden.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-63-454-4896|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Available Facilities:|Outdoor stage, waterside stage, sports field, lotus flower deck, inline skating rinks, duck boat, music fountain, Mulbit Bridge, bike path, etc.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603759_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603759_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603761_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603761_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603762_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603762_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603764_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603764_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603765_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603765_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603766_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603766_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603767_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603767_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603768_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603768_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603769_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659299982539/1603769_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659299982539/176732_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659299982539/176732_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-63-454-4896](tel:+82634544896)\n- [🏠tour.gunsan.go.kr](http://tour.gunsan.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.9509492296\nlongitude: 126.6933626781\ntitle: Miryong-dong, Gunsan-si, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>From \nFrom Gunsan Intercity/Express Bus Terminal Bus Stop, take Bus No. 31, 32, 33, 34 or 38 and get \noff at Gungjeon Wedding Hall (Eunpa Recreation Area) Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-31-1659299982539","title":"Eunpa Lake Park (Eunpa Recreation Area) (은파호수공원(은파국민관광지))","description":"Located in Gunsan, Jeollabuk-do, Eunpa Lake Park was once a reservoir built before the Joseon dynasty that supplied water to nearby farms.
