The waters of Mureunggyegok Valley flow over wide sheets of rock and into the cracks between them, forming large and particularly nice ponds along the path. Starting at Mureung Rock, a wide sheet of single rock on which hundreds can sit, the valley trail twists and turns as it passes Samhwasa Temple, Haksodae, Ongnyudong, and Seonnyeotang Ravine, all the way to Ssangpokpo and Yongchupokpo Falls, providing breathtaking scenery along the way. Also known as Arcadia, scholars and poets frequented the valley in times past, and the 5,000 square meters of Mureung Rock bears the inscribed names of some of these poets and their work. The valley offers a medley of curious-looking rocks and stones, and other odd scenery that attracts many tourists.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Korea Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-33-539-3700|\n|parking:|Available|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00 <br>* July-August 06:00-20:00<br>* November-February 08:00-17:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Hiking Course:|[Course 1] Management Office ‚Üí Samhwasa Temple ‚Üí Haksodae ‚Üí Gwaneumpokpo Falls ‚Üí Ongnyudong (25min one-way)<br />[Course 2] Management Office ‚Üí Ongnyudong ‚Üí Seonnyeotang Ravine ‚Üí Ssangpokpo Falls, Yongchupokpo Falls (40min one-way)<br />[Course 3] Management Office ‚Üí Ongnyudong ‚Üí Dutasanseong Fortress Entrance ‚Üí Dutasanseong Fortress (50min one-way)<br />[Course 4] Management Office ‚Üí Samhwasa Temple ‚Üí Gwaneumam Hermitage Entrance ‚Üí Gwaneumam Hermitage (50min one-way)|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Small vehicles 2,000 won / Large vehicles 5,000 won|\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals: Adults 2,000 won / Teenagers 1,500 won / Children 700 won<br>Groups: Adults 1,500 won / Teenagers 1,000 won / Children 500 won<br /><br>* Group: 30 people or more<br>* Free admission: Senior citizens (ages 65 and older), Preschoolers (ages 6 and under)|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-10-06-1665033039678/2613064_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665033039678/2613064_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-06-1665033039678/2613067_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665033039678/2613067_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-06-1665033039678/2660877_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665033039678/2660877_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-06-1665033039678/2660878_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665033039678/2660878_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-06-1665033039678/2660879_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-06-1665033039678/2660879_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-33-539-3700](tel:+82335393700)\n- [üè†www.dhsisul.org](http://www.dhsisul.org/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.4640430993\nlongitude: 129.0158009877\ntitle: 538, Samhwa-ro, Donghae-si, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Dong Seoul Bus Terminal, take a bus to Donghae Bus Terminal.<br>From Donghae Bus Terminal, take a local bus bound for Mureunggyegok Valley.\n","data":{"id":"2022-10-06-1665033039678","title":"Mureunggyegok Valley (Î¨¥Î¶âÍ≥ÑÍ≥°)","description":"Mureunggyegok Valley, between Dutasan Mountain and Cheongoksan Mountain, refers to a four-kilometer stretch from Hoamso Pond to Yongchupokpo Falls upstream.
