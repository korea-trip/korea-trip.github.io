{"pageProps":{"content":"![Uiamho Lake Skywalk (의암호 스카이워크)](/2022-10-16-1665906295356/2605228_image2_1.webp)\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> Uiamho Lake Skywalk, one of the two largest skywalks in Chuncheon along with Soyanggang Skywalk, is located on Uiamho Bike Path between Kim Youjeong Memorial Stone and Chuncheon Songam Sports Town in the Uiam Lakeside. Connecting with the water bridge section of the bike path, Uiamho Lake Skywalk consists of a 10 m-long straight section and a 10 m-diameter circular section, located 12 m above the water. The entire floor is made of transparent glass, so visitors will feel like walking on the water. When you stand on the skywalk, you will encounter a picturesque view of Samaksan Mountain and Uiamho Lake. Soyanggang Skywalk boasts another splendid scenery of Chuncheon. Although the access from the Kim Youjeong Memorial Stone is close to Uiam Lake Skywalk, parking space is insufficient, thus, it is recommended to use the public parking lot near Chuncheon Songam Sports Town. It takes 15 min by foot or bike along the Uiamho Bike Path from the public parking lot to Uiam Lake Skywalk. It is a great place for a stroll amid the magnificent landscape.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-33-250-3089|\n|opendate:|June 14, 2014|\n|parking:|Not allowed(Parking lot of Uiam Ice Rink inside Songam Sports Town)|\n|restdate:|January, February, and December|\n|usetime:|09:00–18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Parking Fees:|Free of charge|\n|Admission Fees:|Free of charge|\n|Restrooms:|None|\n|Available Facilities:|Skywalk above water|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-10-16-1665906295356/2605230_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-16-1665906295356/2605230_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-16-1665906295356/2605231_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-16-1665906295356/2605231_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-16-1665906295356/2605232_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-16-1665906295356/2605232_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-16-1665906295356/2605233_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-16-1665906295356/2605233_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-16-1665906295356/2605234_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-16-1665906295356/2605234_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-16-1665906295356/2605229_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-16-1665906295356/2605229_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-33-250-3089](tel:+82332503089)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.8471622126\nlongitude: 127.6799656772\ntitle: 468-1, Chiljeon-dong, Chuncheon-si, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway/Train]<br>\nChuncheon Station (Gyeongchun Line), Exit 1.<br><br>\n[Taxi]<br>\nApprox. 15 min from Chuncheon Station.\n","data":{"id":"2022-10-16-1665906295356","title":"Uiamho Lake Skywalk (의암호 스카이워크)","description":"Uiamho Lake Skywalk, one of the two largest skywalks in Chuncheon along with Soyanggang Skywalk, is located on Uiamho Bike Path between Kim Youjeong Memorial Stone and Chuncheon Songam Sports Town in the Uiam Lakeside.

Originally established as Baegamseonwon Temple in 973, the temple changed its name several times, went through construction works, and has become the current Cheongpyeongsa Temple. Yi Ja-hyeon, a scholar of the Goryeo period, built a garden here by keeping its natural topography after he left his government post. In this area, there is a pond that was built during the Goryeo period and has preserved its original form. Many cultural heritages have disappeared over the years and during the Korean War as well. The remaining cultural heritages include Hoejeonmun Gate of Cheongpyeongsa Temple (Treasure No. 164), Three-story Stone Pagoda of Cheongpyeongsa Temple (Gangwon-do Cultural Heritage Material No. 8), and Stupa of Yi Ja-hyeon (posthumous epithet  Jillakgong). Cheongpyeongsa Temple’s Hoejeonmun Gate was built instead of Sacheonwangmun Gate (the gate of the Four Guardian Kings), in order to enlighten people about the transmigration of souls. Cheongpyeongsa Temple bears a myth about a princess and a serpent. The princess suffered a lot from a serpent as she couldn’t get rid of it from her body. Then she came to Cheongpyeongsa Temple and prayed to the Buddha, and she became free from the serpent. Therefore, the Three-story Stone Pagoda of Cheongpyeongsa Temple is also called “Princess Pagoda.” Although the scale of the temple is not large, it is known for beautiful natural landscape harmonized with artificial structures, such as a pavilion and a pond. Accordingly, the area of the temple was designated as Scenic Site No. 70. Cheongpyeongsa Temple can be also reached by taking a ferry at the Soyanggang Dam Quay.","regDate":"2022-10-22","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-22-1666424746299/1780622_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-22-1666424746299"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
