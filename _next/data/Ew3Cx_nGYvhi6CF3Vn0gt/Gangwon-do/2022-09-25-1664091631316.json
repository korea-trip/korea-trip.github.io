{"pageProps":{"content":"![Guryongsa Temple (Íµ¨Î£°ÏÇ¨)](/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2391453_image2_1.webp)\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> Guryongsa Temple is located 6 kilometers from Birobong Peak on Chiaksan Mountain, in the direction of Hakkok-ri. It was believed that Monk Uisang (625-702) of the Silla Kingdom (57 BC - AD 935) built and named the temple Guryongsa in 668 during the reign of King Munmu. However, it is now known that the temple was built after King Sukjong, the 19th King of the Joseon dynasty (1392-1910), who reigned from 1674 to 1720, because of the architectural style of Daeungjeon Hall. There is a legend that the Guryongsa Temple site was originally a lake where nine dragons lived. The name Guryong comes from the story that the lake was filled up to build the temple on it. There are many buildings such as Daeungjeon Hall, Bogwangnu Pavilion, Samseonggak Pavilion, Simgeomdang Hall and Seolseondang Hall. Daeungjeon Hall has maintained its original shape though it was repaired many times.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-33-732-4800|\n|parking:|Available (Chiaksan National Park)|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Sunrise - Sunset|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Hiking Course:|* Guryongsa Temple - Seryeompokpo Falls - Birobong Peak - Guryongsa Temple (10.9 km / 6 hr)<br>* Guryongsa Temple - Seryeompokpo Falls - Birobong Peak - Godeunchi - Bugok-ri (15.8 km / 8 hr)<br>* Hwanggol Cave - Ipseoksa Temple - Birobong Peak - Seryeompokpo Falls - Guryongsa Temple (10.7 km / 5 hr)<br>* Hanggu-dong - Gukhyangsa Temple - Hyangnobong Peak - Seryeompokpo Falls - Guryongsa Temple (14.2 km / 7 hr)<br>* Geumdae-ri - Yeongwonsa Temple - Namdaebong Peak - Birobong Peak - Seryeompokpo Falls - Guryongsa Temple (22.6 km / 12 hr)<br>* Seongnam-ri - Sangwonsa Temple - Namdaebong Peak - Birobong Peak - Seryeompokpo Falls - Guryongsa Temple (23.8 km / 13 hr)|\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 2,500 won / Teenagers 800 won / Children 500 won<br>Groups - Adults 2,300 won / Teenagers 700 won / Children 400 won<br><br>* Groups: 30 people or more|\n|Parking Fees:|Compact vehicles: First hour 500 won / each additional 10 min 100 won / Max. daily fee 5,000 won / Monthly pass 50,000 won<br>Small & Mid-sized vehicles: First hour 1,100 won / each additional 10 min 250 won (peak season 300 won) / Max. daily fee 13,000 won / Monthly pass 150,000 won<br>Large vehicles: First hour 2,000 won / each additional 10 min 400 won (peak season 500 won) / Max. daily fee 20,000 won / Monthly pass 200,000 won|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2391440_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2391440_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2391442_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2391442_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2391445_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2391445_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2391446_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2391446_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2391447_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2391447_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2391448_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2391448_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2648995_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2648995_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2648997_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2648997_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2648998_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2648998_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2391441_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2391441_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-33-732-4800](tel:+82337324800)\n- [üè†www.templestay.com](https://www.templestay.com/temple_info.asp?t_id=guryongsa )\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.3995043418\nlongitude: 128.0498675732\ntitle: 500, Guryongsa-ro, Wonju-si, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Train + Bus]<br>\nFrom Cheongnyangni Station, take a train to Wonju Station.<br>\nFrom Wonju Station, take Bus No. 41 and get off at Guryongsa Temple Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-09-25-1664091631316","title":"Guryongsa Temple (Íµ¨Î£°ÏÇ¨)","description":"Guryongsa Temple is located 6 kilometers from Birobong Peak on Chiaksan Mountain, in the direction of Hakkok-ri.

Originally established as Baegamseonwon Temple in 973, the temple changed its name several times, went through construction works, and has become the current Cheongpyeongsa Temple. Yi Ja-hyeon, a scholar of the Goryeo period, built a garden here by keeping its natural topography after he left his government post. In this area, there is a pond that was built during the Goryeo period and has preserved its original form. Many cultural heritages have disappeared over the years and during the Korean War as well. The remaining cultural heritages include Hoejeonmun Gate of Cheongpyeongsa Temple (Treasure No. 164), Three-story Stone Pagoda of Cheongpyeongsa Temple (Gangwon-do Cultural Heritage Material No. 8), and Stupa of Yi Ja-hyeon (posthumous epithet  Jillakgong). Cheongpyeongsa Temple‚Äôs Hoejeonmun Gate was built instead of Sacheonwangmun Gate (the gate of the Four Guardian Kings), in order to enlighten people about the transmigration of souls. Cheongpyeongsa Temple bears a myth about a princess and a serpent. The princess suffered a lot from a serpent as she couldn‚Äôt get rid of it from her body. Then she came to Cheongpyeongsa Temple and prayed to the Buddha, and she became free from the serpent. Therefore, the Three-story Stone Pagoda of Cheongpyeongsa Temple is also called ‚ÄúPrincess Pagoda.‚Äù Although the scale of the temple is not large, it is known for beautiful natural landscape harmonized with artificial structures, such as a pavilion and a pond. Accordingly, the area of the temple was designated as Scenic Site No. 70. Cheongpyeongsa Temple can be also reached by taking a ferry at the Soyanggang Dam Quay.","regDate":"2022-10-22","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-22-1666424746299/1780622_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-22-1666424746299"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
