With no entrance as such, the cave is not open to the general public and thus its original form remains preserved to this day, giving it a high geological value. <Br><Br> Although the Dangcheomuldonggul Cave is technically a lava tube, it resembles a limestone cave due to the secondary geological formations of lime substances that have accumulated in the ground above the tube. The tunnel has a spectacular and mystical beauty with countless stalactites and stalagmites, as well as stalactite columns. The particularly thin stalactites and stalactic columns in this cave are well-known for their uniqueness and beauty. Although this is a relatively small lava tunnel, its exotic colors and the richness of the secondary topological formations make it extraordinary in terms of research value.

Records show people have been living on the islands since as long as 1271, during the reign of Goryeo King Wonjong, at which point they were referred to as Hupungdo Islands, serving as a safe harbor for ships sailing between Jeju and the mainland. The name changed to Chujado Islands during the Joseon dynasty due to the lush forest of walnut trees, chuja in the Jeollanam-do dialect.
