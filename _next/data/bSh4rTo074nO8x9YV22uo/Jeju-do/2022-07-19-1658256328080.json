Visitors can explore around in a train that looks like 1800s’ steam powered Baldwin train. The&nbsp;seven Baldwin train look-alike (Lincoln Train)&nbsp;operated in the park were specially ordered and manually manufactured in UK. In the large Gotjawal forest with railway trails, visitors can see a variety of plants, animals, and insects living in the mysterious Gotjawal forests, while touring around by the special train. It also has a lake for visitors to experience the ecosystem of the forest, take a walk and enjoy a picnic. Besides, there are many things to enjoy including Eco Bridge, Eco Windmill, Picnic Garden, Kid’s Town, Eco Road, Bare Foot on Scoria, Floating Café, and topiary art works.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-64-802-8020|\n|parking:|Available|\n|usetime:|[May-September] 09:00-17:00 <br>[October] 08:30-19:00<br> [November-April] 09:00-16:50<BR>* Time between trains: 7-12 minutes <br> * Time for the last train subject to change depending on the sunset hours. <br>* Ticketing hours: 10 min. before the last train leaves. <br>* If you would like to enjoy the long course, make sure to take the train at least 1 hour before the last train.|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Adults (ages 19 and over):  Individual 14,000 won / Group 12,000 won<br> Teenagers (ages 13-18): Individual 12,000 won / Group 10,000 won<br> Children (ages 25 months-12): Individual 10,000 won / Group 8,000 won<br> <br> * Group: 30 people or more (Infants under the ages of 2 are not eligible for free admission.

With no entrance as such, the cave is not open to the general public and thus its original form remains preserved to this day, giving it a high geological value. <Br><Br> Although the Dangcheomuldonggul Cave is technically a lava tube, it resembles a limestone cave due to the secondary geological formations of lime substances that have accumulated in the ground above the tube. The tunnel has a spectacular and mystical beauty with countless stalactites and stalagmites, as well as stalactite columns. The particularly thin stalactites and stalactic columns in this cave are well-known for their uniqueness and beauty. Although this is a relatively small lava tunnel, its exotic colors and the richness of the secondary topological formations make it extraordinary in terms of research value.

Records show people have been living on the islands since as long as 1271, during the reign of Goryeo King Wonjong, at which point they were referred to as Hupungdo Islands, serving as a safe harbor for ships sailing between Jeju and the mainland. The name changed to Chujado Islands during the Joseon dynasty due to the lush forest of walnut trees, chuja in the Jeollanam-do dialect.
