When Jagwangsa Temple was built in the district, Song Siyeol saw it as a sign and created a village school near the temple to train his pupils. It was his hope that the sacred land would aide in the raising of gifted students who would grow to serve their community and country. When building the school, Song Siyeol also planted a juniper tree that, 300 years later, still proudly stands by Jagwangsa Temple.<br><br>Upon entering the temple area, visitors will find to their left the Seongjeonnyeongdangji Memorial Stone, which serves to commemorate Song Siyeol and his school. Next to the memorial stone is a pond in which carp swim lazily around lotus flowers. From the white wooden chair in front of the pond, there is a large bell to the left and main Dharma Hall to the right.","regDate":"2022-07-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Daejeon","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-12-1657640803079/2689629_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Daejeon/2022-07-12-1657640803079"},{"id":"2022-07-12-1657637193971","title":"Daejeon Hoedeok Dongchundang Park (ÎåÄÏ†Ñ ÌöåÎçï ÎèôÏ∂òÎãπ Í≥µÏõê)","description":"Dongchundang Park was once the residence of Song Jung-gil, a noted scholar during the Joseon dynasty.
