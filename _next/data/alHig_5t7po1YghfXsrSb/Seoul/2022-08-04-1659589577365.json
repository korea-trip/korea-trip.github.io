Iljasan Mountain is one of the best spots in Seoul to watch the sunrise. Located on the mountain is the house of Master Lee Jip (pen-name Dunchon), providing a good getaway spot for local residents. Lee Jip was a loyal government official during the reign of King Gongmin during the late Goryeo dynasty. He was forced to move to an underground tunnel in the southwest side of Iljasan Mountain to avoid entrapment by Shin Don, a person of influence at the time. While living in hiding, he took the pen-name Dunchon (meaning drawing back to the countryside) to symbolize the hardships he was going through. The nearby area was named after him, being called Dunchon-dong.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-2-3425-6443|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Available Facilities:|Indoor and outdoor badminton venue, gymnasium, X-game hall, plaza, parking lot, Chohwaryu Hall, ecological pond, etc.|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659478_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659478_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659479_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659479_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659480_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659480_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659481_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659481_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659482_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659482_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659485_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659485_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659487_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659487_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659490_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659490_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659492_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659492_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659486_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659589577365/659486_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n\n- [üè†parks.seoul.go.kr](http://parks.seoul.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5327334966\nlongitude: 127.1508007360\ntitle: 660, Dongnam-ro, Gangdong-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\n- Take Blue Bus No. 361 and get off at Bohun Hospital. <Br>\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-04-1659589577365","title":"Iljasan Mountain Natural Park (ÏùºÏûêÏÇ∞ÏûêÏó∞Í≥µÏõê)","description":"Iljasan Mountain is the tallest peak in Gangdong-gu, Seoul, providing the western boundary between Gangdong-gu and Hanam-si, Gyeonggi-do.

Many people enjoy hiking the path that begins at Sajik Tunnel, which leads to the peak of the mountain passing the fortress walls, then hike back down to Buam-dong. The hiking course is also connected to the road in front of Cheongwadae, so hikers can also walk along the historical Palpan-ro road, Hyoja-ro road, and Gyeongbokgung Palace. The hiking path located behind Sajik Park leads to Hwanghakjeong Pavilion, where archers during the Joseon dynasty once honed their marksmanship. The Hwanghakjeong Pavilion was originally located within the Gyeonghuigung Palace, but was relocated to the mountain. From the top, a panoramic view of the surrounding area spreads as far as Inwangsan Mountain, Naksan Mountain, Namsan Mountain, and Baegaksan Mountain with Gyeongbokgung Palace at its center.<br><br>The hiking path past Sajik Park's T-intersection is a popular walking course to nearby office workers during lunch time. A view of Cheongwadae is visible from atop Beombawi Rock (tiger's rock). For hikers seeking to walk along the ridges, it is recommended to take the path down to Hongje-dong quarry or Jahamun Gate. Hikers are recommended to take their time to fully enjoy the view of the surroundings while walking along the path of the outer walls. The stone stairway following the path past Changuimun Gate will take hikers to the path along the outer walls. This path stretches for approximately 200 meters and a set of stones used to build the city walls during the reign of King Taejo, King Sejong, and King Sukjung still remain along the way. The thick, dark-colored mosses on the stones indicate the long history of Seoul.<br><br>The view of the refreshing landscape and Inwangsan Mountain's peak will greet the hikers once they walk back to the inner city walls through a step of stones. Hikers will be able to get a bird's-eye-view of Seoul's mountains and skyscrapers surrounding the Hangang River. The city walls along the path going down to Cheongun-dong still withhold their beauty from the past.<br><br>Inwangsan Mountain stands at a x_height of 338.2 meters and spreads throughout the regions of Hongje-dong in Seodaemun-gu and Muak-dong, Nusang-dong, Ogin-dong and Buam-dong in Jongno-gu. The unique and colossal rock formations and the view of Seoul and Cheongwadae are only a few of the many charms of Inwangsan Mountain.","regDate":"2022-08-04","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-04-1659605785634/1894462_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-08-04-1659605785634"},{"id":"2022-08-04-1659602774980","title":"Inwangsa Temple (Ïù∏ÏôïÏÇ¨ (ÏÑúÏö∏))","description":"Inwangsa Temple refers to the entire cluster of small Buddhist temples located on Inwangsan Mountain (alt. 338m) in the heart of Seoul.
