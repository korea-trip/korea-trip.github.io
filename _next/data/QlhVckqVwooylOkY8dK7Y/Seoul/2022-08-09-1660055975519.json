It was impossible to determine the full scale of the ancient tombs in this area due to the severity of destruction. The largest tomb, the third tomb, measures 49.6 meters from east to west, 43.7 meters from south to north, and 4 meters in x_height. The tomb features three layers of stones topped by a smooth mound, which is a tomb style originating from the Goguryeo dynasty (37 BC-AD 668). The tombs are presumed to belong to one of the earliest leaders of the Baekje dynasty (18 BC-AD 660), which was founded by the people of Goguryeo who had come down southwards to establish a new kingdom around the Hangang River basin. <br><br>\n\nThe square-shaped fourth tomb features a structure similar to the third tomb. Many pieces of earthenware from the early Baekje era were found in the fourth tomb. Also excavated around this site was a gold spangle earring. The third and fourth tombs have been registered as Historic Site No. 243. The tomb site offers valuable information concerning the culture and customs of the Baekje dynasty in its golden age around the 4th century, as well as the relations between the three ancient kingdoms (Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla) around that time.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-2-421-0970|\n|parking:|Available (Public Parking Lot)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|None|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-09-1660055975519/203892_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-09-1660055975519/203892_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-09-1660055975519/203893_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-09-1660055975519/203893_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-09-1660055975519/566756_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-09-1660055975519/566756_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-09-1660055975519/566759_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-09-1660055975519/566759_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-09-1660055975519/1567837_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-09-1660055975519/1567837_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-09-1660055975519/1567838_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-09-1660055975519/1567838_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-09-1660055975519/203890_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-09-1660055975519/203890_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-09-1660055975519/2462073_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-09-1660055975519/2462073_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-09-1660055975519/2462075_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-09-1660055975519/2462075_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-09-1660055975519/2462077_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-09-1660055975519/2462077_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-2-421-0970](tel:+8224210970)\n- [üè†www.cha.go.kr](http://www.cha.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5021945110\nlongitude: 127.1028309684\ntitle: 21, Garak-ro 7-gil, Songpa-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway]<BR>\nSeokchon Station (Seoul Subway Line 9), Exit 7.<br>Walk for approx. 700 m.\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-09-1660055975519","title":"Seoul Seokchon-dong Ancient Tombs (ÏÑúÏö∏ ÏÑùÏ¥åÎèô Í≥†Î∂ÑÍµ∞)","description":"The Ancient Tombs in Seokchon-dong were found and investigated as part of the city development project in Jamsil district.
