Sign posts are installed along the way to each of the sceneries to prevent tourists from getting  lost.<br><br>Scenic Beauty 1  Hwaam Mineral Spring<br>At Hwaam Mineral Spring, water rises up through a rock crater located in Dong-myeon, Jeongseon. The water is said to be good for stomachaches, eye infections, and skin diseases; and, as it contains nine essential elements such as calcium and fluorine, it tastes crisp and clean. <br><br>Scenic Beauty 2  Turtle Rock <br>Part of the path leading to Hwaam Mineral Spring is buttressed by a cliff, on which there is a rock that resembles the shape of a turtle. <br> <br>Scenic Beauty 3  Yongmaso<br>With its clean water and wide sheets of rock, Yongmaso Lake is a popular attraction for vacationers. <br><br>Scenic Beauty 4  Hwaamdonggul Cave<br>Hwaamdonggul Cave used to be a gold mine that was commercially operated from 1922 to 1945. The nation‚Äôs 5th largest goldmine was, however, found to have natural stalactites, and later the cave was developed as the only theme-based cave that combined gold and nature. The stalactite area is an open space of 2,800„é° and the length of the path open to visitors is 1,803 meters. The entire area consists of 5 chapters, which in turn constitute 41 zones; it takes about an hour and a half to see all of the zones. <br><br>Scenic Beauty 5  Hwapyoju Cliff<br>Hwapyoju is a cliff facing the entrance of Hwapyo-dong, which can be seen on the way from Hwaam-dong to Molundae. The cliff may appear as if a giant sharpened a large sheet of rock and placed it upright, or less imaginatively, as if two pillars are standing side by side. <br><br>Scenic Beauty 6  Sogeumgang River<br>The four-kilometer stretch from Hwapyoju to Molundae, surrounded with 100 to 150-meter high rock cliffs and thick forest, is called Sogeumgang River (small Geumgang River), meaning that its beautiful scenery is reminiscent of that of the breathtaking Geumgangsan Mountain.<br><br>Scenic Beauty 7  Molundae Cliff<br>Molundae literally means ‚Äòthe cliff beyond which clouds disappear‚Äô. The tip of the steep cliff is adorned with three specimens of 500-year-old pine trees. Legend has it that gods would perch on the cliff‚Äôs top and enjoy the beautiful view. At the foot of the cliff lies a large sheet of rock that can accommodate hundreds of people. <br><br>Scenic Beauty 8  Gwangdaegok Valley<br>Gwangdaegok Valley is said to be the mysterious place where heaven, earth and clouds meet. The surrounding hills are very rough and bumpy, which makes the area a renowned mountain in Korea. There is a belief among wild-ginseng diggers that they can find great ginseng if they pray in Gwangdaegok, so it is a popular attraction for such prospectors.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-33-560-2363|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-09-29-1664438126298/175710_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-29-1664438126298/175710_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-29-1664438126298/175714_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-29-1664438126298/175714_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-29-1664438126298/178889_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-29-1664438126298/178889_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-33-560-2363](tel:+82335602363)\n- [üè† www.ariaritour.com</a> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br><a href=\"http://www.jsimc.or.kr/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"New window popup\" class=\"web\">www.jsimc.or.kr](http://www.ariaritour.com)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.3293513838\nlongitude: 128.7856368231\ntitle: 1328, Yaksu-gil, Jeongseon-gun, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n1.
