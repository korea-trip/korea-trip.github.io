It was formed after the independence of Korea (August 15) as a residential area in the empty place where the previous Gukje Market was demolished. Book stores began opening one-by-one and soon the street became known as Bosu-dong Book Street. The street is popular amongst booklovers for their used books as well as new books, and amongst travelers for the street’s unique atmosphere. Many young adults also frequent the street because there are many specialty shops for comic books. Every year, the Bosu-dong Culture Festival takes place and visitors can participate in events such as, make-your-own book cover, make-your-own book, and so on. The festival not only gives an opportunity to learn about the history of Bosu-dong Book Street, but have a good time as well. <br> \n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-51-743-7650|\n|usetime:|Bosu-dong Book Street Cultural Hall 10:00-18:00<br>* Individual operating hours vary by book store.|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-15-1657890753285/1877370_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-15-1657890753285/1877370_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-15-1657890753285/1877453_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-15-1657890753285/1877453_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-15-1657890753285/1877469_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-15-1657890753285/1877469_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-15-1657890753285/2364306_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-15-1657890753285/2364306_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-15-1657890753285/2364307_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-15-1657890753285/2364307_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-15-1657890753285/2364308_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-15-1657890753285/2364308_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-15-1657890753285/2364309_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-15-1657890753285/2364309_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-15-1657890753285/2364310_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-15-1657890753285/2364310_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-15-1657890753285/2364311_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-15-1657890753285/2364311_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-51-743-7650](tel:+82517437650)\n- [🏠http://www.bosubook.com](http://www.bosubook.com)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.1037975381\nlongitude: 129.0278431547\ntitle: 8, Chaekbanggolmok-gil, Jung-gu, Busan\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n1) Toseong Station (Busan Subway Line 1), Exit 1.<br>\nTake a right at the corner of Busan Bank and walk along the street until the Bosu Four-way intersection (sageori).<br>\nThe book street will be located on the left.\n<br><br>\n2) Jagalchi Station (Busan Subway Line 1), Exit 3.<br>\nTake a right immediately and then walk straight for about 620m.<br>\nCross the main road, Daecheong-ro, and the book street is straight ahead.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-15-1657890753285","title":"Bosu-dong Book Street Cultural Center(보수동 책방골목 문화관)","description":"The used bookstore that sells memories <br> Bosu-dong Book Street has a unique background.

It was originally called Songhyeonsan Mountain, which means a mountain with a view of the sea through the dense pine tree forest. Later, the name was changed to Yongdusan Mountain, as the mountain peak was shaped similar to a dragon's head, protecting the area against foreign invaders overseas.<br><br>The mountain held shrines for the mountain gods built by the Japanese before the 8.15 Liberation. Now the mountain is home to a variety of monuments, including Cheokhwabi Monument, Chunghontap Pagoda, 4.19 Revolution Monument, a statue of Admiral Yi Sun-shin, and Busan Tower. During the Korean War, refugees built houses on the sides of the mountain all the way to the summit but these neighborhoods burned down twice, leaving the mountain bare. Since then, fierce efforts of planting trees have led to transforming the burnt mountain into a beautiful park. The park was called Unam Park at the time of the Liberal Party’s ruling but was renamed to Yongdusan Park after the April 19 Revolution. The park offers a beautiful view of Busan Port and the surrounding scenery. In particular, the night view from Busan Tower is magnificent.","regDate":"2022-08-18","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Busan","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-18-1660838172085/2640557_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Busan/2022-08-18-1660838172085"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
