Depending on the day and the tide, it may appear to be five islands or six islands, hence the name ('o' meaning five and 'yuk' meaning six in Korean). The islands are full of cliffs, caves and free-roaming animals and plants. The islands were intact to the mainland approximately 120,000 years ago, but due to continuous wave erosion, island were separated.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-51-888-3636, <BR>+82-51-607-6395|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Tour Course Information:|[Half-day course]<br>Igidae Costal Path - Oryukdo Island - Baengunpo - Sinseondae<br><br>[One-day course]<br>Igidae - Jangjasan Mountain - Oryukdo Island - Baengunpo - Sinseondae - Hwangryeongsan Mountain|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-17-1660779464381/2597454_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-17-1660779464381/2597454_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-17-1660779464381/2616903_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-17-1660779464381/2616903_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-17-1660779464381/2616904_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-17-1660779464381/2616904_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-17-1660779464381/2616905_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-17-1660779464381/2616905_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-17-1660779464381/2616907_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-17-1660779464381/2616907_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-17-1660779464381/2654785_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-17-1660779464381/2654785_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-17-1660779464381/2654786_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-17-1660779464381/2654786_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-51-888-3636](tel:+82518883636)\n- [🏠www.busan.go.kr/geopark](http://www.busan.go.kr/geopark/index)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.1014773335\nlongitude: 129.1231321559\ntitle: 137, Oryukdo-ro, Nam-gu, Busan\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-17-1660779464381","title":"Oryukdo Island [National Geopark] (오륙도 (부산 국가지질공원))","description":"Oryukdo Island refers to a group of rocky islands off the southern coast of Busan.

It was originally called Songhyeonsan Mountain, which means a mountain with a view of the sea through the dense pine tree forest. Later, the name was changed to Yongdusan Mountain, as the mountain peak was shaped similar to a dragon's head, protecting the area against foreign invaders overseas.<br><br>The mountain held shrines for the mountain gods built by the Japanese before the 8.15 Liberation. Now the mountain is home to a variety of monuments, including Cheokhwabi Monument, Chunghontap Pagoda, 4.19 Revolution Monument, a statue of Admiral Yi Sun-shin, and Busan Tower. During the Korean War, refugees built houses on the sides of the mountain all the way to the summit but these neighborhoods burned down twice, leaving the mountain bare. Since then, fierce efforts of planting trees have led to transforming the burnt mountain into a beautiful park. The park was called Unam Park at the time of the Liberal Party’s ruling but was renamed to Yongdusan Park after the April 19 Revolution. The park offers a beautiful view of Busan Port and the surrounding scenery. In particular, the night view from Busan Tower is magnificent.","regDate":"2022-08-18","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Busan","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-18-1660838172085/2640557_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Busan/2022-08-18-1660838172085"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
