By entering the hiking trail of the falls, you will encounter a narrow and deep gorge. Formed through quartzitic jointing, the gorge has a mysterious atmosphere with its strange rocks and bizarre stones, which look sharp and precipitous. As the gorge and falls keep their cool temperature, the area is a popular summer resort. Deungseon Falls is one of the Eight Sights of Deungseon, along with Seunghak Falls, Baengnyeon Falls, and Biryong Falls. The quickest way to get to Deungseon Falls starts from the Deungseon Falls Ticket Booth, which is close to Gangchon.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-33-262-2215|\n|parking:|Available(100 vehicles)|\n|restdate:|Open year round|\n|usetime:|00:00–24:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|KRW 2,000|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-09-21-1663747034812/181845_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-21-1663747034812/181845_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-21-1663747034812/181847_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-21-1663747034812/181847_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-21-1663747034812/181848_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-21-1663747034812/181848_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-21-1663747034812/181846_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-21-1663747034812/181846_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-21-1663747034812/1842025_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-21-1663747034812/1842025_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-21-1663747034812/1842028_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-21-1663747034812/1842028_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-21-1663747034812/484686_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-21-1663747034812/484686_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-33-244-2331](tel:+82332442331)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.8260420693\nlongitude: 127.6596487065\ntitle: 1401-30, Gyeongchun-ro, Seo-myeon, Chuncheon-si, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Dong Seoul Bus Terminal to Chuncheon Intercity Bus Terminal, take an intercity bus.<br>\nAnd take Bus 51 and get off at Samaksan Mountain Bus Stop.<br> Walk 350m  along the trekking road to reach the valley.<br><br>\n[Train]<br>\nFrom Gangchon Station (ITX-train), take a taxi to the valley.

In this zone, visitors have various ways to enjoy Seoraksan Mountain and the natural environment of the East Sea region. <br><br>Sokcho, which occupies the largest area in the zone, comes first when talking about Seoraksan National Park. Tourists can appreciate the picturesque scenery of the sea and coastal lakes as well as the mountain scenery of Seoraksan Mountain. Hikers can climb the mountain or ride a cable car. Sokcho Beach is a hot spot that attracts young people who fill the place with energy and life all through the summer. <br><br>Abai Village, which appeared in several TV dramas for its unique atmosphere, and Sokcho Jungang Market offer local specialties, such as abai sundae (Korean sausage) and dak gangjeong (glazed fried chicken  bites). <br><br>Goseong, which is bordered by Seoraksan Mountain and Geumgangsan Mountain, is part of the Northern Limit Line (NLL) that offers a unpolluted, beautiful landscape around the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).

The cable car boarding station is located in the Small Park of Seoraksan National Park. It takes about 10 min to get to the Gwongeumseong Fortress (700m above sea level) by the cable car. One-way ticket is not available, so visitors need to buy a round-trip ticket. Visitors can also enjoy an open view of various famous attractions such as Ulsan Peak and Manmulsang Rocks beyond glass window in the cable car. The Gwongeumseong Fortress, unfolding a panoramic view of Seoraksan Mountain’s majestic scenery, bears a legend in which two generals Gwon and Kim built the fortress in one day to prevent enemy invasion during the Goryeo period. Today, the site of the fortress only remains. Many hikers come up to the summit of the fortress despite its rough course to appreciate magnificent and mysterious scenery of strange rocks and bizarre stones at Seoraksan Mountain. When you are at the summit, you can see the landscape of not only the Outer Seorak but also the Inner Seorak. Below the Gwongeumseong Fortress are Allagam Hermitage built during the Silla period and Muhaksong (Korean red pine) existed for hundreds of years. As many tourists visit the mountain at weekends and during public holidays and autumn foliage season, it is recommended to schedule your trip by considering the waiting time too.","regDate":"2022-10-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-12-1665550201815/1950308_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-12-1665550201815"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
