Visitors can feel the peaceful and serene atmosphere when walking around the site. The reason it came to be called ‘Mirinae’ is that Korean Catholics came to this place in secret to avoid persecution during the late Joseon dynasty, and the lamplight coming from their homes in the village where they settled resembled the starlight of the Milky Way.","regDate":"2022-08-31","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Holy Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-31-1661935642682/1589723_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-08-31-1661935642682"},{"id":"2022-08-31-1661932387069","title":"Manggyeongam Hermitage (망경암)","description":"Manggyeongam’s name derives from the hermitage's view of Seoul, and is located in Bokjeong-dong of Seongnam, Gyeonggi-do. Manggyeongam Hermitage is said to be the place where kings of the late Goryeo and early Joseon periods prayed for peace for their subjects. In addition, Prince Pyeongwon, the 7th son of King Sejong, and Grand Prince Jean built an altar at Mangyeongam Hermitage and Chilseongdae Peak and pledged filial piety. <br><br>The hermitage is more widely known for its connection to the Chilseong faith, in which believers worship Chilseong (the Seven Stars). It is easily recognized by the written records inscribed into the rock wall. Located at the hermitage is the Rock-carved Seated Buddha, an original work of the hermitage that is also designated Gyeonggi-do’s Tangible Cultural Asset No. 102. The Buddha is embossed inside a deep hole in the rock. In the words inscribed near the statue, there is also a legend that says Lee Gu-seung carved Gwaneum Statue near Rock-carved Seated Buddha and built the hermitage in 1897. <br><br>Next to the hermitage is a pond called “Bokumul,” which means “blessed sugared water.” The neighborhood of Bojeong-dong takes its name from this pond. At the hermitage, Daeungjeon Hall (the main hall), Samseonggak Shrine (shrine for three spirits), and Mireukjeon Hall were all established fairly recently. The hermitage site also includes a huge Mireuk Daebul statue (Great State of Maitreya Buddha) and a five-story stone pagoda.","regDate":"2022-08-31","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-31-1661932387069/2021847_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-08-31-1661932387069"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
