{"pageProps":{"content":"![Uisangdae Pavilion (낙산사 의상대)](/2022-10-16-1665910327005/2711338_image2_1.webp)\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> This pavilion is located on a seaside cliff on the way from Yangyang’s Naksansa Temple to Gwaneumgul Cave of Hongnyeonam Hermitage. The word “dae” in Uisangdae refers to a building built at a vantage point for areas with beautiful scenery. Indeed, the view of the East Sea and the coast from Uisangdae Pavilion awarded its recognition as one of the Eight Sights of Yangyang, and a must-visit place for all visitors to Naksansa Temple. Jeong Cheol (pen-name  Songgang), a famed scholar and writer of the poem Song of Diamond Mountains, chose the pavilion as one of the Eight Sights of Gwandong, and the pavilion is today one of the popular sites for sunrise-viewing on the east coast of Korea. Together with Hongnyeonam Hermitage, it is designated as the Scenic Site No. 27 of Korea under the name “Uisangdae Pavilion and Hongnyeonam Hermitage of Naksansa Temple, Yangyang.” Uisangdae is named after Uisang, a respected Silla-era Buddhist monk who is said to have founded this temple in 671 (11th year of King Munmu’s reign of Silla), and many stories of his deeds can still be found in the temple. For instance, Uisangdae is said to be the site where he meditated before founding Naksansa Temple at its present site. Today’s pavilion was restored to its present hexagonal form in 1995.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-33-672-2447|\n|opendate:|In 1995|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Summer season 04:00–20:00 / Winter season 05:30–18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Film Locations:|Filming site of the TV Show Taejo Wang Geon|\n|Available Facilities:|Uisangdae Pavilion, Naksansa Temple|\n|Activity Fees:|[Entrance Fees to Naksansa Temple’s Cultural Heritage]<br> Individual: Adults 4,000 won / Teenagers 1,500 won / Children 1,000 won<br> Group: Adult 3,000 won / Teenagers 1,000 won / Children 700 won|\n|Parking Fees:|4,000 won|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|None|\n|Reservation Info. for Foreigners:|None|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-10-16-1665910327005/483706_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-16-1665910327005/483706_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-16-1665910327005/483710_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-16-1665910327005/483710_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-16-1665910327005/678000_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-16-1665910327005/678000_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-16-1665910327005/678019_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-16-1665910327005/678019_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-16-1665910327005/678020_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-16-1665910327005/678020_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-16-1665910327005/2356894_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-16-1665910327005/2356894_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-16-1665910327005/678021_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-16-1665910327005/678021_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-16-1665910327005/678022_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-16-1665910327005/678022_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-16-1665910327005/2356912_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-16-1665910327005/2356912_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-33-672-2447](tel:+82336722447)\n- [🏠www.naksansa.or.kr](http://www.naksansa.or.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 38.1253701685\nlongitude: 128.6307430562\ntitle: 100, Naksansa-ro, Yangyang-gun, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Yangyang Intercity Bus Terminal Bus Stop, take Bus No. 9 and get off at Naksansa Temple Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-10-16-1665910327005","title":"Uisangdae Pavilion (낙산사 의상대)","description":"This pavilion is located on a seaside cliff on the way from Yangyang’s Naksansa Temple to Gwaneumgul Cave of Hongnyeonam Hermitage.
