{"pageProps":{"content":"![Biseondae Rock (비선대)](/2022-10-21-1666345971150/650537_image2_1.webp)\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> Biseondae Rock is a large rock located in the Cheonbuldong Valley of Seoraksan Mountain. The rock blended with a giant surrounding rocky wall creates a mysterious atmosphere. When it rains, water flows down through the rock and forms a small waterfall. The stream of water winding around the rock is considered the magnificent view, which is similar to that of the Manpokdong Valley in Geumgangsan Mountain. When the season changes, its landscape boasts different scenery  full-blown flowers in spring, green and refreshing trees in summer, colorful autumnal leaves in autumn, and white snowy view in winter. Due to such a mysterious landscape, Biseondae Rock bears a legend in which Taoist hermit called Magoseon enjoyed scenery of this place and ascended to heaven. The name of Biseondae, meaning the rock (dae) where a Taoist hermit (seon) flew up (bi) to the sky, originates from this legend.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-33-801-0900|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Open 24 hr|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Activity Fees:|Free of charge|\n|Parking Fees:|Free of charge|\n|Available Facilities:|Valley|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-10-21-1666345971150/650537_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-21-1666345971150/650537_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-21-1666345971150/650539_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-21-1666345971150/650539_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-21-1666345971150/650540_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-21-1666345971150/650540_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-21-1666345971150/650541_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-21-1666345971150/650541_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-21-1666345971150/650544_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-21-1666345971150/650544_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-21-1666345971150/652553_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-21-1666345971150/652553_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-21-1666345971150/652554_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-21-1666345971150/652554_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-33-801-0900](tel:+82338010900)\n- [🏠seorak.knps.or.kr](http://seorak.knps.or.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 38.1735618013\nlongitude: 128.4884989154\ntitle: 1091, Seoraksan-ro, Sokcho-si, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Sokcho Intercity Bus Terminal, take Bus No. 7  to Seorakdong Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-10-21-1666345971150","title":"Biseondae Rock (비선대)","description":"Biseondae Rock is a large rock located in the Cheonbuldong Valley of Seoraksan Mountain.
