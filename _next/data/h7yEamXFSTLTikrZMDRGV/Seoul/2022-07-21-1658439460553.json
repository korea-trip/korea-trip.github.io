The church was founded in 1887 as a small worship house under the name Bethel by Henry Gerhard Appenzeller, an American missionary. As the number of followers increased, the building underwent construction and officially became a church in 1895. Chungdong Church is the only remaining church building from the 19th century. The church was expanded once more in 1926, changing its from a cross-shaped building to a square one. The expansion was made by adding walls using bricks as not to damage the original building structure. The architecture was built in a simplified version of an American gothic house with arched window frames.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Chinese, Japanese)<br>‚Ä¢ For more Info: +82-2-753-0001~3|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-21-1658439460553/1569255_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658439460553/1569255_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658439460553/1569256_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658439460553/1569256_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658439460553/1569257_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658439460553/1569257_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658439460553/1569258_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658439460553/1569258_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658439460553/1569259_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658439460553/1569259_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658439460553/1955148_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658439460553/1955148_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658439460553/1955151_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658439460553/1955151_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658439460553/1955152_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658439460553/1955152_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658439460553/1955154_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658439460553/1955154_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-21-1658439460553/1955155_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-21-1658439460553/1955155_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-2-753-0001](tel:+8227530001)\n- [üè†www.chungdong.org](http://chungdong.org/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5654653714\nlongitude: 126.9723466121\ntitle: 46, Jeongdong-gil, Jung-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway]<br>\nCity Hall Station (Seoul Subway Line 1 & 2), Exit 1, 2 or 12.<br>\nWalk for 5 min towards Ehwa Women‚Äôs High School.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-21-1658439460553","title":"Chungdong First Methodist Church (ÏÑúÏö∏ Ï†ïÎèôÍµêÌöå)","description":"Chungdong Church, having being completed in 1897, was the first Christian church that was built after the spread of Protestantism in Korea.

It wasn't until 1593 that the palace was used as a temporary palace of the royal family after their home was burned down during the Imjin War. King Seonjo also stayed at Deoksugung Palace after returning to the city. It became a proper palace when Gwanghaegun (1575-1641) ascended to the throne and gave this royal residence the name Gyeongungung Palace in 1611. Over the following decades, the palace alternated between being an official palace and a temporary residence. The name did not change officially to Deoksugung Palace, meaning the ‚Äúpalace of virtuous longevity,‚Äù until 1907. While the palace once encompassed a vast area with many buildings, the current palace grounds are just a small shadow of the prior splendor, with very few structures remaining.","regDate":"2022-07-22","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Palaces"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1946565_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-07-22-1658472507467"},{"id":"2022-07-22-1658468566302","title":"Daraenamu Tree in Changdeokgung Palace (Ï∞ΩÎçïÍ∂Å Îã§ÎûòÎÇòÎ¨¥)","description":"Daraenamu Tree in Changdeokgung Palace is estimated to be 600 years old, meaning it had likely been planted before the palace was built.

Lee Seong-rye, the mother of Father Thomas Choi Yang-eop (Korea's second ordained priest), has not yet been canonized although she did suffer martyrdom. The reason was that the mother briefly put aside her faith because of the pressures of raising five children after she had her oldest son, Thomas. However, the difficulty of combining these two interests was eventually overcome and she died a martyr.<br><br>Aside from serving as a memorial site, Danggogae Catholic Martyrs' Shrine also offers a commanding view of Seoul.
