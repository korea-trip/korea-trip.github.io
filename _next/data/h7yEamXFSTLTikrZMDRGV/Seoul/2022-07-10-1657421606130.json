It wasn't until 1593 that the palace was used as a temporary palace of the royal family after their home was burned down during the Imjin War. King Seonjo also stayed at Deoksugung Palace after returning to the city. It became a proper palace when Gwanghaegun (1575-1641) ascended to the throne and gave this royal residence the name Gyeongungung Palace in 1611. Over the following decades, the palace alternated between being an official palace and a temporary residence. The name did not change officially to Deoksugung Palace, meaning the ‚Äúpalace of virtuous longevity,‚Äù until 1907. While the palace once encompassed a vast area with many buildings, the current palace grounds are just a small shadow of the prior splendor, with very few structures remaining.","regDate":"2022-07-22","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Palaces"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1946565_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-07-22-1658472507467"},{"id":"2022-07-22-1658468566302","title":"Daraenamu Tree in Changdeokgung Palace (Ï∞ΩÎçïÍ∂Å Îã§ÎûòÎÇòÎ¨¥)","description":"Daraenamu Tree in Changdeokgung Palace is estimated to be 600 years old, meaning it had likely been planted before the palace was built.
