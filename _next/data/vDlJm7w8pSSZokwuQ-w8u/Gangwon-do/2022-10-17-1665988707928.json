The people of Yangyang know the pass as Osaengnyeong, while in Inje it is known as Hangyeryeong. Yi Jung-hwan, a late Joseon period scholar and the author of the geographical text Taengniji (On Selecting a Village), counted Osaengnyeong Pass as the first and the foremost of the six famous passes in Gangwon-do. Indeed, Osaengnyeong Pass was the route through which essential supplies were transported from Yangyang (in Yeongdong) to Inje (in Yeongseo region), and the rough pass taken by the people of Yangyang on the way to Seoul. Its presence in the folklore of the region can be seen in the popular song Hangyeryeong, which speaks to the difficulties of those who had to climb the pass. Hangyeryeong Road was opened in 1981, and today‚Äôs National Road No. 44 is famous for being a driving course through the beauty of Seoraksan Mountain. This is also the starting point of the shortest route to Daecheongbong Peak, the highest peak in Seoraksan Mountain, and the trail to the summit of Jeombongsan Mountain.","regDate":"2022-10-25","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-25-1666695146080/182107_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-25-1666695146080"},{"id":"2022-10-25-1666691767359","title":"Naksan Beach (ÎÇôÏÇ∞Ìï¥ÏàòÏöïÏû•)","description":"Naksan Beach is one of the most famous beaches in Yangyang, located in Joseon-ri, Yangyang-eup, Yangyang-gun, Gangwon-do.

The 4 kilometer-long sand beach contrasts magnificently with the lush pine trees of the area. The water is less than 1.5 meter deep, making it a good place for all ages. Naksanhang Port marks one end of the beach, behind which Naksan Mountain, the location of Naksansa Temple, can be found. The other end has a lake formed at the delta of Namdaecheon Stream, which originates from Seoraksan Mountain. Many cafes, convenience stores, restaurants, and accommodations cater to the needs of the visitors. The beach sees considerable traffic in winter as well, when it serves as a popular venue for sunrise-watching, particularly for the New Year‚Äôs Day festival.","regDate":"2022-10-25","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-25-1666691767359/2609383_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-25-1666691767359"},{"id":"2022-10-25-1666688500348","title":"Mindungsan Mountain (ÎØºÎë•ÏÇ∞)","description":"Situated in Jeongseon, Gangwon-do, Mindungsan Mountain (1,118.8 meters) is an unusual site when compared to other national peaks. As hinted by its names meaning bare mountain, there are few trees near its summit. Locals also refer to it as Eoksaesan (silver grass) Mountain because of the waves of eulalia covering its sides. The mountain remains this way because villagers burned the fields once a year to encourage the growth of wild herbs.<br><br>The mountain‚Äôs gradual slope offers an enjoyable trekking experience for hikers of all levels. In mid-October, waist-high silver grass is indeed everywhere, making it challenging for hikers to view the surrounding areas. Fortunately, certain spots near the peak offer breathtaking views of the gentle ridges and flowing hillsides.<br><br>Silver grass begins blooming in September and reaches peak colors between October and November. The Silver Grass Festival is held on Mindungsan Mountain every October, attracting hundreds of thousands of attendees for a wonderful outdoor hiking experience and picturesque photo opportunities. The mountain is easily accessible by train allowing visitors from near and far to enjoy the fall colors.<br><br>On the outskirts of Mindungsan Mountain near Balgudeok village is Goebyeonggol Valley, which contains magnificent rock formations and limestone caves. Other nearby attractions include Hwaam Yaksu (spring water site), Auraji Naruteo famous for creating Jeongseon Arirang (a local version of the traditional folk song, Arirang), and Gariwangsan Mountain (known for wild ginseng).","regDate":"2022-10-25","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-25-1666688500348"},{"id":"2022-10-25-1666684702603","title":"Micheongol Recreational Forest (Íµ≠Î¶Ω ÎØ∏Ï≤úÍ≥®ÏûêÏó∞Ìú¥ÏñëÎ¶º)","description":"This recreational forest is located at the foot of Guryongnyeong Pass, which connects Yangyang-gun with Hongcheon-gun, along Micheongol Valley.
