It is a home to numerous alpine tree species, as well as wildflowers and herbs. Its trails are popular thanks to the gentle slopes. Gariwangsan National Recreational Forest is located at the Hoedong-ri Village entrance. The recreational forest has various amenities, but the walking path next to the valley is by far the most outstanding. The thick forest blocks out the sky while purifying the air.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-33-562-5833|\n|parking:|Available|\n|usetime:|[Accommodations] Check in 15:00 / Check out 12:00<br>[Park hours] 09:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Camping sites, cabins, recreation hall, etc.|\n|Parking Fees:|Compact cars: 1,500 won<br>Small & mid-sized vehicles: 3,000 won<br>Large vehicles: 5,000 won|\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 1,000 won / Teenagers 600 won / Children 300 won<br>Groups - Adults 800 won / Teenagers 500 won / Children 200 won<br><br>* Adults (ages 19-64) / Teenagers (ages 13-18) / Children (ages 7-12)<br>* Free admission during winter season (December-March)<br>* Free admission: Senior citizens (ages 65 & older), preschoolers (ages 6 & younger)|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582540_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582540_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582544_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582544_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582546_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582546_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582613_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582613_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582615_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582615_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582616_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582616_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582617_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582617_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582916_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582916_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582922_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582922_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582536_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-23-1663926372349/582536_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-33-562-5833](tel:+82335625833)\n- [üè†www.foresttrip.go.kr](https://www.foresttrip.go.kr/indvz/main.do?hmpgId=0113)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.4268471267\nlongitude: 128.5700393556\ntitle: 707, Gariwangsan-ro, Jeongseon-gun, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Taxi]<br>\nApprox. 25 min from Jeongseon Bus Terminal.\n","data":{"id":"2022-09-23-1663926372349","title":"Gariwangsan National Recreational Forest (Íµ≠Î¶Ω Í∞ÄÎ¶¨ÏôïÏÇ∞ÏûêÏó∞Ìú¥ÏñëÎ¶º)","description":"Gariwangsan Mountain is one of the major mountains in the Taebaek Mountain Range.

Connecting with the water bridge section of the bike path, Uiamho Lake Skywalk consists of a 10 m-long straight section and a 10 m-diameter circular section, located 12 m above the water. The entire floor is made of transparent glass, so visitors will feel like walking on the water. When you stand on the skywalk, you will encounter a picturesque view of Samaksan Mountain and Uiamho Lake. Soyanggang Skywalk boasts another splendid scenery of Chuncheon. Although the access from the Kim Youjeong Memorial Stone is close to Uiam Lake Skywalk, parking space is insufficient, thus, it is recommended to use the public parking lot near Chuncheon Songam Sports Town. It takes 15 min by foot or bike along the Uiamho Bike Path from the public parking lot to Uiam Lake Skywalk. It is a great place for a stroll amid the magnificent landscape.","regDate":"2022-10-16","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Culture/Art/History","Architectural Sights","Monuments/Observatories"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-16-1665906295356/2605228_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-16-1665906295356"},{"id":"2022-10-16-1665903453154","title":"Ttansan Mountain (Îî¥ÏÇ∞)","description":"Located just four kilometers away from Hwacheon-eup, Ttansan Mountain is nestled between Paroho Lake and the entrance to Peace Dam, making it appear more like an island floating on the water rather than a mountain. <br>This small island-like mountain offers an interesting and unique setting and the nearby mountains provide a cooling effect with its shadows on the water creating a relaxing resting area.","regDate":"2022-10-16","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-16-1665903453154/2020509_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-16-1665903453154"},{"id":"2022-10-16-1665900040878","title":"The Literary Village of Kim You Jeong (ÍπÄÏú†Ï†ïÎ¨∏ÌïôÏ¥å)","description":"The Literary Village of Kim You Jeong was established on the site of the birth home of Kim, in order to commemorate Kim You-jeong who left various great short story novels of Korea‚Äôs modern times, such as Spring, Spring (1935), and Camellia Flower (1936).
