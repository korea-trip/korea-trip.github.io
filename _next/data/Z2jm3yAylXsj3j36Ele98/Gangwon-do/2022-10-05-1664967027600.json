The entire floor is made of transparent glass, so visitors will feel like walking on the water. When you stand on the skywalk, you will encounter a picturesque view of Samaksan Mountain and Uiamho Lake. Soyanggang Skywalk boasts another splendid scenery of Chuncheon. Although the access from the Kim Youjeong Memorial Stone is close to Uiam Lake Skywalk, parking space is insufficient, thus, it is recommended to use the public parking lot near Chuncheon Songam Sports Town. It takes 15 min by foot or bike along the Uiamho Bike Path from the public parking lot to Uiam Lake Skywalk. It is a great place for a stroll amid the magnificent landscape.","regDate":"2022-10-16","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Culture/Art/History","Architectural Sights","Monuments/Observatories"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-16-1665906295356/2605228_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-16-1665906295356"},{"id":"2022-10-16-1665903453154","title":"Ttansan Mountain (딴산)","description":"Located just four kilometers away from Hwacheon-eup, Ttansan Mountain is nestled between Paroho Lake and the entrance to Peace Dam, making it appear more like an island floating on the water rather than a mountain. <br>This small island-like mountain offers an interesting and unique setting and the nearby mountains provide a cooling effect with its shadows on the water creating a relaxing resting area.","regDate":"2022-10-16","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-16-1665903453154/2020509_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-16-1665903453154"},{"id":"2022-10-16-1665900040878","title":"The Literary Village of Kim You Jeong (김유정문학촌)","description":"The Literary Village of Kim You Jeong was established on the site of the birth home of Kim, in order to commemorate Kim You-jeong who left various great short story novels of Korea’s modern times, such as Spring, Spring (1935), and Camellia Flower (1936).
