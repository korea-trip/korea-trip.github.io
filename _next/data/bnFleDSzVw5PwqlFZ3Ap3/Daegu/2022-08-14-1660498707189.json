It is said that the dish was first offered as an affordable dish to accompany drinks, favored by blue-collar laborers who gathered at the early labor market in front of Pyeonghwa Market in the 1970s. Rather than being pan-fried, chicken gizzard is deep-fried like chicken meat. Inexpensive and delicious, the dish has remained popular. Dakddongjip Town was designated the third \"Good Street” by the Community Chest of Korea, a network of governing bodies that run a philanthropic organization. The Good Street designation is given to the streets where storekeepers subscribe to the Community Chest of Korea’s Good Street campaign to share good deeds.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)|\n|parking:|Paid parking lot inside of Pyeonghwa Market|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-14-1660498707189/1835958_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-14-1660498707189/1835958_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-14-1660498707189/1929303_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-14-1660498707189/1929303_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-14-1660498707189/1929304_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-14-1660498707189/1929304_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-14-1660498707189/1929306_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-14-1660498707189/1929306_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-14-1660498707189/1929307_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-14-1660498707189/1929307_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-14-1660498707189/1929308_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-14-1660498707189/1929308_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-14-1660498707189/1929314_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-14-1660498707189/1929314_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-14-1660498707189/2020462_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-14-1660498707189/2020462_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-14-1660498707189/2020464_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-14-1660498707189/2020464_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-14-1660498707189/1835950_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-14-1660498707189/1835950_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-2-1330](tel:+8221330)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.8833661337\nlongitude: 128.6192824239\ntitle: 10, Ayang-ro 9-gil, Dong-gu, Daegu\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Train]<br>\nTake a train from Seoul Station to Dongdaegu Station.<br><br>\n\n[Express/Intercity Bus]<br>\nFrom Seoul Express Bus Terminal, take an express bus bound for Dong Daegu Express Bus Terminal.<br><br>\n\n[Local Bus]<br>\nGet on Express 1, Circular Line 2-1, 156, 401, 414-1, 521, 618, 708, 808, 980, Dong-gu 3 or Palgong 1. <br>\nGet off in front of Pyeonghwa Market.\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-14-1660498707189","title":"Dakddongjip Town in Pyeonghwa Market (대구 평화시장 닭똥집 골목)","description":"Dakddongjip Town in Pyeonghwa Market was established in 1972, and is a street specializing in chicken gizzard dishes.
