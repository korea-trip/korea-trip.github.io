Succeeding Le Merre in 1896, Father Jeong Gyu-ha (or Augustino), along with Chinese engineers, began to build Pungsuwon Cathedral.<br><br>Completed in 1907 by the faithful, the cathedral still remains a beautiful building even after 110 years; it is a popular spot for visitors, having frequently appeared in Korean dramas and films such as “Love Letter (1995 MBC miniseries).” It is the first cathedral built by a Korean priest as well as in Gangwon-do; it is the fourth cathedral built in Korea.
