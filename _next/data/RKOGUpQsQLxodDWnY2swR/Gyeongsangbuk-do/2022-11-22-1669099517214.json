The water is clear and clean, and a pine forest surrounds the white sandy beach. The beach is 8 kilometers long and 100 meters wide. In addition, the water level is only 1-2 meters deep and the slope is gentle, making it a suitable summer atraction for families with children. The sandy beach is characterized by its thick grain which is good for sand baths and does not stick to the body. <br><br> Daejin Beach also has a 200 meter-wide stream called Songcheoncheon Stream that flows across the white sandy beach. Visitors can enjoy a fresh water bath in the stream. Furthermore, since this stream is where the freshwater and seawater meet, visitors can enjoy both freshwater fishing and sea fishing. <br><br> In general, the eastern coastline is known to be monotonous, but the coastal bay of Chuksan-myeon is an exception. The mountain area is adjacent to the coast, and Jukdosan Mountain draws a complex coastline. The scenery of Jukdosan Mountain with its lush bamboo forest creates a beautiful painting. In addition, the coastal road from Chuksan 1-ri to Daejin Beach is great for enjoying a drive, and the scenery of white waves rolling over the golden sandy beach is beautiful.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-54-730-7721|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Shower booth, restaurants, accommodations, parasol, convenience store,  etc.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-22-1669099517214/575979_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-22-1669099517214/575979_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-22-1669099517214/583661_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-22-1669099517214/583661_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-22-1669099517214/583677_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-22-1669099517214/583677_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-22-1669099517214/634667_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-22-1669099517214/634667_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-22-1669099517214/634670_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-22-1669099517214/634670_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-22-1669099517214/634677_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-22-1669099517214/634677_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-22-1669099517214/634679_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-22-1669099517214/634679_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-22-1669099517214/634681_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-22-1669099517214/634681_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-22-1669099517214/782597_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-22-1669099517214/782597_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-22-1669099517214/575978_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-22-1669099517214/575978_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-54-730-7721](tel:+82547307721)\n- [üè†tour.yd.go.kr](http://tour.yd.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.5645374176\nlongitude: 129.4266915867\ntitle: 2840, Yeongdeokdaege-ro, Yeongdeok-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-22-1669099517214","title":"Daejin Beach (ÎåÄÏßÑÌï¥ÏàòÏöïÏû•)","description":"Daejin Beach is located in Daejin-ri, a coastal village in Yeonghae-myeon, Yeongdeok-gun, and has all the conditions for a coastal attraction.
