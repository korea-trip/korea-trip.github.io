Cape Ganjeolgot is in the spotlight as a new tourist attraction along with Jinha Beach and Seosaengpo Japanese Fortress. The lighthouse is located 20 minutes away from the entrance to Ulsan Nambu Beltway. When acacias bloom along the coast from Ulsan to Haeundae Beach in Busan, the road is filled with its subtle perfume. This road is perfect as a driving course with the combination of beautiful white acacia trees in the hills and the occasional appearance of the sea. Enjoy the tremendous scenery of the invigorating sea and the misty view of the hills.
