It was originally named Wontongam Hermitage, established by Monk Wonhyo during the fourth year of Baekje King Uija‚Äôs reign (644). Wontongam Hermiatge was renamed to Geumoam Hermitage by Monk Yunpil in the 9th year of Goryeo King Gwangjong‚Äôs reign (958), then renamed once again to Hyangiram Hermitage by Monk Inmuk during the 41st year of Joseon King Sukjong‚Äôs reign (1715). <br><br>The temple contains many buildings both preserved and rebuilt, including the main hall, Daeungjeon Hall, which was rebuilt in 2012 after it burned down in a fire. The mountain path to Hyangiram Hermitage is very steep, but many people make the climb in hopes of their wish coming true. Legend has it that anyone who passes all seven of the stone caves on the walk to Hyangiram Hermitage will be granted their wish.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-61-644-4742|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Admission Fees:|Individual: Adults 2,000 won / Teenagers 1,500 won / Children 1,000 won <BR>Groups: Teenagers 1,200 won / Children 800 won <BR>* Adults (ages 19 and older) / Teenagers (ages 13-18) / Children (ages 7-12) <BR>* Groups: 30 people or more|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-02-02-1675312795581/678861_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-02-1675312795581/678861_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-02-1675312795581/678897_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-02-1675312795581/678897_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-02-1675312795581/678903_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-02-1675312795581/678903_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-02-1675312795581/678908_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-02-1675312795581/678908_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-02-1675312795581/678912_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-02-1675312795581/678912_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-02-1675312795581/678918_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-02-1675312795581/678918_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-02-1675312795581/678950_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-02-1675312795581/678950_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-02-1675312795581/678951_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-02-1675312795581/678951_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-02-1675312795581/678952_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-02-1675312795581/678952_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-02-1675312795581/678793_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-02-1675312795581/678793_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-61-644-4742](tel:+82616444742)\n- [üè†tour.yeosu.go.kr</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.heritage.go.kr/heri/cul/culSelectDetail.do?ccbaCpno=3413600400000&pageNo=1_1_1_1\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"ÏÉàÏ∞Ω: Î¨∏ÌôîÏû¨Ï≤≠ ÌôàÌéòÏù¥ÏßÄÎ°ú Ïù¥Îèô\">www.cha.go.kr](http://www.yeosu.go.kr/tour/travel/10tour/hyangilam)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 34.5916329613\nlongitude: 127.8040048886\ntitle: 60, Hyangiram-ro, Yeosu-si, Jeollanam-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2023-02-02-1675312795581","title":"Yeosu Hyangiram Hermitage (Ìñ•ÏùºÏïî(Ïó¨Ïàò))","description":"Hyangiram Hermitage (Cultural Property Material) is one of four Buddhist hermitages in Korea where the faithful come to pray to the Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva.
