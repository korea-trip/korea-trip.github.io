At Changnam, it changes direction and enters Bangu-ri, Buri-myeon, Geumsan-gun. From here, the river flows through steep mountains. At Sutong-ri, the precipitous cliffs of a mountain named Jeokbyeok tower proudly above, and where the river runs under these steep cliffs it is called the Jeokbyeokgang River.<br><br>Jeokbyeok literally means red walls in Korean.
