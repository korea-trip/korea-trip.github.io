They are originally enshrined in Gyeonggijeon Shrine and Jogyeongmyo Shrine, and when Jeonju had fallen during the Donghak Peasant Revolution, the portrait and tablet were moved to a small palace inside the fortress. The original fortress walls were 16 kilometers in circumference with three gates in the north, east, and west, but only a half-moon shaped western gate remains standing today.","regDate":"2023-01-11","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Nature","Natural Sites","County Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-11-1673415344453/1606418_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-11-1673415344453"},{"id":"2023-01-11-1673411996622","title":"Wibongsa Temple - Wanju (ÏúÑÎ¥âÏÇ¨ (ÏôÑÏ£º))","description":"Wibongsa Temple is located past Mujigaemun Gate (Rainbow Gate) and Wibong Village and is a major temple in the Honam region that once oversaw 52 branch temples.
