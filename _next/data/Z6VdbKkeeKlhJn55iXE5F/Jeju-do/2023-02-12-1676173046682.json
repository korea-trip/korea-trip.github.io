With no entrance as such, the cave is not open to the general public and thus its original form remains preserved to this day, giving it a high geological value. <Br><Br> Although the Dangcheomuldonggul Cave is technically a lava tube, it resembles a limestone cave due to the secondary geological formations of lime substances that have accumulated in the ground above the tube. The tunnel has a spectacular and mystical beauty with countless stalactites and stalagmites, as well as stalactite columns. The particularly thin stalactites and stalactic columns in this cave are well-known for their uniqueness and beauty. Although this is a relatively small lava tunnel, its exotic colors and the richness of the secondary topological formations make it extraordinary in terms of research value. This cave has been designated natural monument.<Br><Br>* The UNESCO World Heritage inscribed Geomun Oreum Lava Tube System consists of Bengdwigul, Manjanggul Cave, Gimnyeonggul, Yongcheondonggul and Dangcheomuldonggul Caves.","regDate":"2023-02-15","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-15-1676450494241"},{"id":"2023-02-15-1676446569108","title":"Chujado Islands (Ï∂îÏûêÎèÑ)","description":"Located about 45 kilometers from Jeju Island and 35 kilometers from the Korean Peninsula, Chujado Islands is comprised of four inhabitated islands, called Sangchujado, Hachujado, Chupodo, and Hoenggando, as well as 38 uninhabited islands.

The name changed to Chujado Islands during the Joseon dynasty due to the lush forest of walnut trees, chuja in the Jeollanam-do dialect.
