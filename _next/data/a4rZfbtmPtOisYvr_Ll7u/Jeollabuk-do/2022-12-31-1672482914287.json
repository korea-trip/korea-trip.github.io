{"pageProps":{"content":"![Gwanghalluwon Garden (광한루원)](/2022-12-31-1672482914287/219427_image2_1.webp)\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> Originally known as Gwangtongnu, Gwanghalluwon Garden was built by Hwang Hui Jeongseung in 1419 during the reign of Joseon dynasty’s King Sejong. Because of its outstanding beauty, Governor Jeong In-ji gave the garden the name ‘Gwanghallu’ in 1444, comparing it to a garden from the palace on the moon. It is famous as the location where Lee Mong-ryong and Chunhyang (two lovers from a well-known Korean folk story) first met. In the 1920’s Chunhyangsa Temple was established in the neighboring area and a portrait of Chunhyang was hung in a place of honor. The garden is the venue of the Chunhyangjae Festival every spring, celebrating the deep and lasting love of the famous couple. The area around Gwanghalluwon Garden is full of many attractions, includes Ojakgyo Bridge, symbolizing the bridge connecting Chilseok and Gyeonwu from the traditional story of Chilseok, as well as Chunhyang Hall, Wolmae-jip (house of Chunhyangs mother), Wanwoljeong Pavilion, Yeongjugak Pavilion, Samsinsan and many other traditional buildings.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-63-620-6172|\n|parking:|Available (Small vehicles: 213 spaces / Large vehicles: 66 spaces)|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|April-October: 08:00-20:00 (Free admission after 19:00) <br>November-March: 08:00-20:00 (Free admission after 18:00)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|[Admission to Gwanghalluwon Garden]<br> Adults (ages 19-64): 3,000 won / Group: 2,500 won / Special discount: 1,800 won<br> Teenagers (ages 13-18): 2,000 won / Group: 1,500 won / Special discount: 1,000 won<br> Children (ages 7-12): 1,500 won / Group: 1,000 won / Special discount: 700 won<br> <br> * Group: over 30 people (must enter together with same purpose)<br> * Special discount: holders of same-day admission ticket to Chunhyang Theme Park<br> * Free admission: Preschoolers (ages 6 and younger), Senior citizems (ages 65 and older)|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Information center, resturant, shops|\n|Parking Fees:|Sedan: One-day parking 2,000 won / Monthly parking 30,000 won <br> Small bus (15 passengers or under): One-day parking 2,000 won / Monthly parking 30,000 won <br> Mid-sized & Large bus (16 passengers or more): One-day parking 4,000 won / Monthly parking 60,000 won<br> Freight vehicles (1 ton or under): One-day parking 2,000 won / Monthly parking 30,000 won<br> Freight vehicles (more than 1 ton): One-day parking 3,000 won / Monthly parking 45,000 won|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-31-1672482914287/1604098_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-31-1672482914287/1604098_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-31-1672482914287/1604100_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-31-1672482914287/1604100_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-31-1672482914287/2563391_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-31-1672482914287/2563391_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-31-1672482914287/1604099_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-31-1672482914287/1604099_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-31-1672482914287/1604101_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-31-1672482914287/1604101_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-31-1672482914287/1604102_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-31-1672482914287/1604102_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-31-1672482914287/1604103_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-31-1672482914287/1604103_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-31-1672482914287/1604104_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-31-1672482914287/1604104_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-31-1672482914287/1604105_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-31-1672482914287/1604105_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-63-620-6172](tel:+82636206172)\n- [🏠www.gwanghallu.or.kr](http://www.gwanghallu.or.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.4029038525\nlongitude: 127.3793853018\ntitle: 1447, Yocheon-ro, Namwon-si, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Express/Intercity Bus]<br>\nTake a bus from Central City Terminal to Namwon Bus Terminal.<br><br>\n\n[Train]<br>\nTake a train from Yongsan Station to Namwon Station.<br>\n<br>\n\n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Namwon Express Bus Terminal or Namwon Intercity Bus Terminal, take Bus No. 211, 220, 230, or 281 to Chueo Samgeori Bus Stop.<br><br>\n\nFrom Namwon Station, take Bus No. 133, 142, or 161 to Jaeil Bank Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-31-1672482914287","title":"Gwanghalluwon Garden (광한루원)","description":"Originally known as Gwangtongnu, Gwanghalluwon Garden was built by Hwang Hui Jeongseung in 1419 during the reign of Joseon dynasty’s King Sejong.
