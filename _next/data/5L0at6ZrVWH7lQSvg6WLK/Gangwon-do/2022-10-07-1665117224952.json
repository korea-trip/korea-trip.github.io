Indeed, its reputation can be seen in the picturesque view of the white and red lighthouse, breakwater, and the fishing boats docked at the port. Another point of interest at Namaehang Port is the Namaehang Skywalk Observatory. Located at the entrance to the breakwater, this observation point offers a breathtaking view of the Namaehang Port area and the East Sea. The island, where the skywalk is located, was called Yangyado Island during the Joseon period, and the site of this observation point used to have a beacon during the Joseon period. Namae Fishing Village Experience, a village that is fed by the Namaehang Port, offers fishing boat trips for visitors, along with hand fishing, rock crab catching, and stuffed squid making. Some of Namaehang Port’s major catches include squid, plaice, and flatfish.
