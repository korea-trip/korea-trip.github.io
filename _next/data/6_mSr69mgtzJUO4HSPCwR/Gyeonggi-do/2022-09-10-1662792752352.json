Oddly shaped rocks and peaks make the landscape particularly beautiful. Historical relics from the Later Goguryeo period, including the site of a fortress for Gung Ye (the first king of the short-lived Later Goguryeo state) can be seen on the mountain. Majestic peaks surround Mangyeongdae, the main peak, and forests of broad-leaved trees turn striking colors in the fall. \n<br><br>\nThe trails are beautiful with purple magnolias in mid-April and azaleas and mountain magnolias in May. The Unaksan Mountain Autumn Leaves Festival is held in mid-October every year as the leaves begin to turn. Together with Gwanaksan, Chiaksan, Hwaaksan, and Songaksan Mountains, Unaksan Mountain is one of the five most rugged mountains in the Central region and a popular one.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-31-534-6330|\n|opendate:|2007|\n|parking:|Available|\n|usetime:|[Park Hours] 09:00-18:00<br>[Accommodations] Check in 15:00 / Check out 12:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 1,000 won / Teenagers 600 won / Children 300 won<br>Groups - Adults 800 won / Teenagers 500 won / Children 200 won<br><br>* Groups: 20 people or more<br>* Adults (ages 19-64) / Teenagers (ages 13-18) / Children (ages 7-12)<br>* Free admission for preschoolers (ages 6 and younger) & senior citizens (ages 65 and older)<br>* No admission charged December-March|\n|Available Facilities:|Accommodations, multipurpose field, natural recreation hall, outdoor class, training center, nature trails, etc.|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-09-10-1662792752352/1900201_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-10-1662792752352/1900201_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-10-1662792752352/1900202_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-10-1662792752352/1900202_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-10-1662792752352/1900203_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-10-1662792752352/1900203_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-31-534-6330](tel:+82315346330)\n- [üè†www.foresttrip.go.kr](https://www.foresttrip.go.kr/indvz/main.do?hmpgId=0224)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.8831650163\nlongitude: 127.3065181095\ntitle: 39, Hwadong-ro 184beon-gil, Pocheon-si, Gyeonggi-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Express/Intercity Bus]<br>\nTake a bus from Dong Seoul Terminal to Pocheon.<br><br>\n\n[Taxi]<br>\nApprox. 35 min from Pocheon Bus Terminal\n","data":{"id":"2022-09-10-1662792752352","title":"Unaksan National Recreational Forest (Íµ≠Î¶Ω Ïö¥ÏïÖÏÇ∞ÏûêÏó∞Ìú¥ÏñëÎ¶º)","description":"Unaksan Mountain rises 934.7 meters above sea level.

On old maps, the mountain had been called Mayusan Mountain because of the horses raised in the area, but today it is more widely known as Yumyeongsan Mountain. The trail that starts from Yangpyeong leads to an expansive and open grassland. The hiking trails are also connected to those of Mount Daebusan and Mount Sogunisan.
