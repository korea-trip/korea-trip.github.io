It was part of North Korean land after 1945, but was returned to South Korea in 1951. A sign labeling the station as the final station on the line was installed in 1971. With the opening of Baengmagoji Station on November 20, 2012, the station lost its title as the last station.

On old maps, the mountain had been called Mayusan Mountain because of the horses raised in the area, but today it is more widely known as Yumyeongsan Mountain. The trail that starts from Yangpyeong leads to an expansive and open grassland. The hiking trails are also connected to those of Mount Daebusan and Mount Sogunisan.
