Estimated to have been created 400 to 500 million years ago, the cave is known to serve as a habitat for the endangered golden bats. The cave's total length stretches for 1,510 meters, with only 810 meters of the cave open the public while the rest of cave remains protected for preservation purposes. The cave features ceiling craters, one of which is the longest in Korea, along with stalactite curtains, travertine terraces, stalactite cascades, and many other fantastic rock formations.
