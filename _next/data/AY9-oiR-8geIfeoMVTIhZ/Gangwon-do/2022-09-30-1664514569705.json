With soft sand and shallow waters, it is a popular beach location. In winter, various migratory birds and swans can be seen, as the birds enjoy clean water and food from the field of reeds. Because of its excellent scenery, Kim Il-seong of North Korea and the former South Korean President Rhee Syngman and Vice-president Lee Ki-poong had summer houses here. It also has Hwajinpo Museum of History with more than 40,000 artifacts from 1,500 species.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-33-680-3677|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Film Locations:|KBS drama \"Autumn in My Heart (2000)\"|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-09-30-1664514569705/1813108_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-30-1664514569705/1813108_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-30-1664514569705/1813109_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-30-1664514569705/1813109_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-30-1664514569705/1813110_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-30-1664514569705/1813110_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-30-1664514569705/1813113_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-30-1664514569705/1813113_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-30-1664514569705/1906630_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-30-1664514569705/1906630_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-30-1664514569705/2369991_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-30-1664514569705/2369991_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-30-1664514569705/2369993_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-30-1664514569705/2369993_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-30-1664514569705/2369995_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-30-1664514569705/2369995_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-30-1664514569705/2369997_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-30-1664514569705/2369997_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-33-680-3677](tel:+82336803677)\n- [üè†www.gwgs.go.kr</a> <br><a href=\"http://hwajinpo-lake.co.kr/\" target=\"_blank\">hwajinpo-lake.co.kr](http://www.gwgs.go.kr/tour)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 38.4657017316\nlongitude: 128.4367778262\ntitle: Geojin-eup, Goseong-gun, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-09-30-1664514569705","title":"Hwajinpo Lake (ÌôîÏßÑÌè¨(ÌôîÏßÑÌè¨Ìò∏))","description":"Hwajinpo Lake is the largest lagoon in Korea with its sand made from seashells and rocks that were broken down over thousands of years.
