This natural habitat for wildlife is home to fallow deer, formosan deer, elk, chipmunks, mandarin ducks, mallards, spot-billed ducks and moorhens. There is also an observatory to help visitors get a better view of the local wildlife. <br><br> * Experiential Learning Park<br> Occupying the structure of the former Ttukseom Water Treatment Facility, this refurbished educational area was established to house an insect botanical garden, wild flower garden, themed flower garden, event ground and surrounding protective forest. <br><br> * Marsh Plants Garden<br> Making use of the local reservoir‚Äôs natural environment, the Wetlands Ecological Field contains a wetlands ecological management office, ecological playground, outdoor nature classroom, bird observatory, wetlands flower garden and botanical garden fed with local, clear waters. <br><br> * Hangang Riverside Park <br> Located southwest of Seoul Forest, this riverside area at the junction of the Hangang River and Jungnangcheon Stream features a waterfront park, marina and rest area.","regDate":"2022-08-08","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-08-1660001990922/2611300_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-08-08-1660001990922"},{"id":"2022-08-08-1659998432991","title":"Seoul Folk Flea Market  - Traditional Arts & Crafts Studio (ÏÑúÏö∏ÌíçÎ¨ºÏãúÏû• Ï†ÑÌÜµÎ¨∏ÌôîÏ≤¥ÌóòÍ¥Ä)","description":"The Traditional Arts & Crafts Studio in Seoul Folk Flea Market was created to give both locals and international visitors a chance to experience the traditional arts of Korea first-hand.
