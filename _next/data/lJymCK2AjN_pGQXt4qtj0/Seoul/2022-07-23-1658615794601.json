There is also an observatory to help visitors get a better view of the local wildlife. <br><br> * Experiential Learning Park<br> Occupying the structure of the former Ttukseom Water Treatment Facility, this refurbished educational area was established to house an insect botanical garden, wild flower garden, themed flower garden, event ground and surrounding protective forest. <br><br> * Marsh Plants Garden<br> Making use of the local reservoir’s natural environment, the Wetlands Ecological Field contains a wetlands ecological management office, ecological playground, outdoor nature classroom, bird observatory, wetlands flower garden and botanical garden fed with local, clear waters. <br><br> * Hangang Riverside Park <br> Located southwest of Seoul Forest, this riverside area at the junction of the Hangang River and Jungnangcheon Stream features a waterfront park, marina and rest area.","regDate":"2022-08-08","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-08-1660001990922/2611300_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-08-08-1660001990922"},{"id":"2022-08-08-1659998432991","title":"Seoul Folk Flea Market  - Traditional Arts & Crafts Studio (서울풍물시장 전통문화체험관)","description":"The Traditional Arts & Crafts Studio in Seoul Folk Flea Market was created to give both locals and international visitors a chance to experience the traditional arts of Korea first-hand.

Built in the Madubong Hill area, this location where Hamchunwon, the outer garden of Changgyeonggung Palace, once stood in 1484 (15th year of King Seongjong), was also once the site of Gyeongmogung Palace, where King Jeongjo enshrined the mortuary tablet of his birth father Crown Prince Sado Seja in 1776 (the year King Jeongjo ascended to the throne). <br><br>These places that held importance for the royal family were destroyed as the Japanese built Gyeongseong Empire University in its place. In 1907, with the announcement of the plan to establish Daehan Medical Center, construction began on the main building, seven wards and affiliated buildings.  Construction was completed in November 1908. <br><br>The Daehan Medical Center opened in Gwangjewon, but upon Japanese colonization in 1910, its name was changed to the Japanese Viceroyalty Hospital.
