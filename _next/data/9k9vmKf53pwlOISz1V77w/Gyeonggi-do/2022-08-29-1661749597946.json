{"pageProps":{"content":"![Jarasum Island (ÏûêÎùºÏÑ¨)](/2022-08-29-1661749597946/2482681_image2_1.webp)\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> Located in Gapyeong, Gyeonggi-do, Jarasum Island is an island formed on the Bukhangang River as a result of the construction of the Cheongpyeong Dam in 1943. The name &lsquo;Jarasum&rsquo; comes from the fact that it faces a hill that resembles a Jara (Korean word for soft-shelled turtle). Jarasum consists of four islands called Dongdo, Seodo, Jungdo, and Namdo, and has various leisure and park facilities. Visitors can find a car camping site and the filming location of the popular TV drama series 'Iris' on Seodo (west island), and an eco-cultural park with a grass plaza of over 100 meters in diameter on Jungdo (central island). There is also an ecosystem theme park called Ehwawon Garden at the westernmost tip of the Jarasum Campground. A popular camping spot, Jaraseom Island is also widely known as the venue of the annual Jarasum International Jazz Festival.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-31-580-4632|\n|parking:|Public parking lot available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Jaraseom Island camping site, Eco & Culture Park, 'Iris' filming location, ecosystem theme park (Ewhawon), etc.|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-29-1661749597946/2431922_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661749597946/2431922_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-29-1661749597946/2431928_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661749597946/2431928_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-29-1661749597946/2431929_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661749597946/2431929_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-29-1661749597946/2482665_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661749597946/2482665_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-29-1661749597946/2482668_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661749597946/2482668_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-29-1661749597946/2482669_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661749597946/2482669_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-29-1661749597946/2482671_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661749597946/2482671_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-29-1661749597946/2482677_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661749597946/2482677_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-29-1661749597946/2560407_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661749597946/2560407_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-29-1661749597946/2560394_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661749597946/2560394_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-31-580-4632](tel:+82315804632)\n- [üè†www.jarasum.net](http://www.jarasum.net)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.8208928790\nlongitude: 127.5210475885\ntitle: 60, Jaraseom-ro, Gapyeong-gun, Gyeonggi-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway]<br>\nFrom  Sangbong Station (Seoul Subway Line 7, Gyeongui-Jungang Line), transfer to Gyeongchun Line and get off at Gapyeong Station. <BR>\nWalk for approx. 15 min.<BR>\n<br>\n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Sangbong Bus Terminal or Dong Seoul Bus Terminal, take an intercity bus to Gapyeong Bus Terminal.<br>\nWalk for approx. 15 min.\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-29-1661749597946","title":"Jarasum Island (ÏûêÎùºÏÑ¨)","description":"Located in Gapyeong, Gyeonggi-do, Jarasum Island is an island formed on the Bukhangang River as a result of the construction of the Cheongpyeong Dam in 1943.
