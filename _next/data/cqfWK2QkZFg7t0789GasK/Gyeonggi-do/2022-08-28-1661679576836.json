Janganmun Gate served as the main gate because the king would pass from this gate when arriving from Hanyang, the capital city, now modern-day Seoul. It is interesting to note that this gate is larger than Sungryemun Gate in Seoul.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-031-228-4416|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|March-October 09:00-18:00<br>November-February 09:00-17:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|[Suwon Hawseong Fortress]<br>Adults: Individuals 1,000 won / Groups 700 won<br>Teenagers: Individuals 700 won / Groups 500 won<br>Children: Individuals 500 won / Groups 300 won<br><br>[Hwaseong Haenggung Palace] <br>Adults: Individuals 1,500 won / Groups 1,200 won<br>Teenagers: Individuals 1,000 won / Groups 800 won<br>Children: Individuals 700 won / Groups 500 won<br><br>* Groups: 20 persons or more|\n|Parking Fees:|Small/Mid-sized car 2,000 won for 3 hours / 10,000 won for one-day<br>Large-sized car 4,000 won for 3 hours / 15,000 won for one-day<br>* 200 won for each additional 10 minutes after 3 hours|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|English, Japanese|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-28-1661679576836/734408_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-28-1661679576836/734408_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-28-1661679576836/734409_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-28-1661679576836/734409_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-28-1661679576836/734411_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-28-1661679576836/734411_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-28-1661679576836/734412_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-28-1661679576836/734412_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-28-1661679576836/1092241_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-28-1661679576836/1092241_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-28-1661679576836/2514364_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-28-1661679576836/2514364_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-28-1661679576836/2514365_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-28-1661679576836/2514365_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-28-1661679576836/2514366_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-28-1661679576836/2514366_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-28-1661679576836/2514367_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-28-1661679576836/2514367_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-031-228-4416](tel:+820312284416)\n- [üè†suwon.go.kr</a> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br><a href=\"http://www.swcf.or.kr/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"web\">www.swcf.or.kr](http://www.suwon.go.kr/web/visitsuwon/index.do)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.2888704361\nlongitude: 127.0142422513\ntitle: 910, Jeongjo-ro, Paldal-gu, Suwon-si, Gyeonggi-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nSuwon Station (Seoul Subway Line 1), Underground Shopping Mall Exit 3.

The trail that starts from Yangpyeong leads to an expansive and open grassland. The hiking trails are also connected to those of Mount Daebusan and Mount Sogunisan.
