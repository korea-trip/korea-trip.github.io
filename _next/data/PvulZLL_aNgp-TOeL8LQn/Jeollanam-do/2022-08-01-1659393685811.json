The recreational park is located on the mid-slope of Bangjangsan Mountain. Many species of wild flowers and broad-leaved trees are distributed all over Bangjangsan Recreational Forest where an exciting paragliding contest takes place annually. This is a great place to unpack and take a break for one or two days as it has accommodation facilities, promenades and trekking courses as well as a small area for splashing in the water. It takes approximately three hours to the mountain's summit from the recreational forest. In addition, there is a trekking path that leads to the Seokjeong Hot Springs on the way down the mountain.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|accomcount:|500 people for a day|\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-61-394-5523|\n|parking:|Available|\n|usetime:|Accommodations: 15:00 - 12:00 (next day)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 1,000 won / Teenagers 600 won / Children 300 won<br>Groups - Adults 800 won / Teenagers 500 won / Children 200 won<br><br>* Groups - 20 people or more<br>* Adults (ages 19-64) / Teenagers (ages 13-18) / Children (ages 7-12)<br>* Free admission December-March|\n|Facility Utilization Fees:|Accommodations: Low Season & Weekdays / Peak Season & Weekends<br><br>[Forest Cabin] <br>- Rooms (36„é°, 5 people) 46,000 won / 85,000 won<br>- Rooms (46„é°, 8 people) 77,000 won / 134,000 won<br>- Rooms (66„é°, 11 people) 91,000 won / 151,000 won<br><br>[Forest Culture Recreation Center] <br>- Rooms (23„é°~26„é°, 4 people) 39,000 won / 68,000 won<br>- Rooms (29„é°~36„é°, 5-6 people) 50,000 won / 91,000 won<br>- Rooms (49„é°~56„é°, 8-9 people) 85,000 won / 144,000 won|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Compact cars: 1,500 won <br>Small cars: 3,000 won <br>Large vehicles: 5,000 won |\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-01-1659393685811/2040885_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659393685811/2040885_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659393685811/2040890_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659393685811/2040890_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659393685811/2040894_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659393685811/2040894_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659393685811/2040895_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659393685811/2040895_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659393685811/2040898_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659393685811/2040898_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-61-394-5523](tel:+82613945523)\n- [üè†www.huyang.go.kr](http://www.huyang.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.4451632173\nlongitude: 126.7458042490\ntitle: 353, Bangjang-ro, Jangseong-gun, Jeollanam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Train] <br>\nTake a train to Baegyangsa Station from Yongsan Station (Seoul).<br>\nTake a taxi to Bangjangsan Recreational Forest from Baegyangsa Station.\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-01-1659393685811","title":"Bangjangsan National Recreational Forest (Íµ≠Î¶Ω Î∞©Ïû•ÏÇ∞ÏûêÏó∞Ìú¥ÏñëÎ¶º)","description":"Situated between Jeollanam-do and Jeollabuk-do, Bangjangsan National Recreational Forest is the highest rising peak along the ridge starting from the west of Naejangsan Mountain.

He is known to be the grandson of the heavens and the son of Hwanung. According to the legend, Hwanung was approached by a bear and a tiger who wished to become human beings. Hwanung attended to their plea by instructing them to avoid sunlight for 100 days and live only by consuming garlic and mugwort. Unlike the tiger who gave up, the bear followed the instructions faithfully and transformed into a woman, who then married Hwanung and gave birth to Dangun.<br><br> Located near Yeonguncheonbyeon in Gokseong-eup, Dangunjeon Shrine was first founded in Hakjeong-ri, Samin-dong in 1916 by Shin Tae-yun, also known as Baekdang, but later moved to its current location and went through reconstruction in 1931. An annual ancestral rite takes place at the shrine on October 3 (National Foundation Day) and March 15 to pay respects to Dangun. Dangunjeon Shrine was also a place where civilians gathered to take an oath of patriotism in action against the Japanese during the Japanese colonization period; a stone plaque commemorating the March 1st Independence Movement and Baekdang Memorial Hall dedicated to Shin Tae-yun can also be found within the area. Shin Tae-yun was captured by Japanese soldiers during the March 1st Independence Movement and served two years in prison.","regDate":"2023-01-20","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollanam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-20-1674196823651/1609432_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollanam-do/2023-01-20-1674196823651"},{"id":"2023-01-20-1674192977194","title":"Geumseongsanseong Fortress (Îã¥Ïñë Í∏àÏÑ±ÏÇ∞ÏÑ±)","description":"Geumseongsanseong Fortress in Geumseongsan Mountain (603m) forms a boundary between two small villages located on the border of two provinces (Geumseong-myeon, Damyang-gun, Jeollanam-do and Sunchang-gun, Jeollabuk-do) and is one of the three popular mountains of the Honam region (the Southwestern region of Korea that includes Jeollanam-do and Jeollabuk-do).
