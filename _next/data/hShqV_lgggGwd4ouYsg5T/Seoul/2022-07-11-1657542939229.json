The path along the area‚Äôs thick forest and natural valleys provides an excellent getaway.

The structure consists of a main room offering a good view of the whole village, spacious bedrooms, a large garden, and annex buildings. As it withholds the beauty of a traditional hanok while incorporating the modern trend of its time, Baek In-je House is considered to be highly valuable in means of both architecture and history, representing the Bukchon Hanok Village together with Yun Bo-seon House.<br /><br />Baek In-je House was built from black pine, which was first introduced in Seoul during the Gyeongseong Expo in 1907, distinguishing itself from other upper-class houses of its time. Unlike other traditional hanok designs that separate the main building from the other rooms, Baek In-je House connects the two with a hallway, allowing convenient access between the two structures. The house also consists of a Japanese-style hallway and floor mat rooms, reflecting the interior trends of that period. Baek In-je House is also unique in that the main room is partially built as a two-story structure, a style that was never seen in any traditional hanok built during the Joseon period.","regDate":"2022-07-11","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Old Houses"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-11-1657507335227/2481892_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-07-11-1657507335227","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Seoul/2022-07-11-1657507335227"},{"id":"2022-07-11-1657494251347","title":"Aqua Planet 63 (ÏïÑÏø†ÏïÑÌîåÎùºÎÑ∑ 63)","description":"Aqua Planet 63 located in 63 Square was opened on July 1, 2016.

Even the entrance gate is shaped like a huge dolmen and the trash cans are ancient diagonal-line patterned earthenware. Archaeological Site in Amsa-dong was excavated in 1925 when a flood washed away the soil on the banks of the Hangang River and exposed a large number of diagonal-line patterned earthenware. After several excavations, the Archaeological Site in Amsa-dong was established. <br><br> The site was a location for a massive colony, thus many ancient buildings, stone axes and stone arrows have been uncovered as well as countless diagonal-line patterned earthenware.  The housing site is round with a spot in the center for fire.  The site is colossal and possesses nine mud huts, two exhibition halls displaying ancient artifacts and an open mud hut where visitors can experience life in the Neolithic Era. The site offers many attractions such as mud huts and promenades. Archaeological Site in Amsa-dong is also very educational for children and families who want to learn and experience the Neolithic Age.","regDate":"2022-07-10","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-10-1657496332644/204019_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-07-10-1657496332644","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Seoul/2022-07-10-1657496332644"}],"navList":["Incheon","Seoul"]},"__N_SSG":true}
