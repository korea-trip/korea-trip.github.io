After promising to pick her up later, he returned to the beach to do his work. However, the weather turned bad as strong winds and pummeing waves begun. The husband failed to rescue his wife on time and she ultimately drowned. Since then, the villagers were unable to catch any fishes and some claimed that it wasbecause of the dead maid. To soothe the spirit of the dead maid, the villagers made several wooden carvings and held religious ceremonies.

The ceremony is still honored today as a traditional folk event.","regDate":"2022-10-10","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Theme Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-10-1665385902206/1425887_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-10-1665385902206"},{"id":"2022-10-10-1665383309027","title":"Samcheok Deokpunggyegok Valley Village (삼척 덕풍계곡마을)","description":"Deokpung Village is a typical mountain village with bountiful resources and a great potential for development.
