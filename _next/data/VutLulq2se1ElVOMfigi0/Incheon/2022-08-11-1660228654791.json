Originally, the temple was dubbed ‚ÄòCheongnyangsa‚Äô and the nearby mountain was called ‚ÄòCheongnyangsan.‚Äô<br><br>\n\nUnfortunately, the temple was lost to fire during the Imjin War (1592) and was left desolate for 340 years. In 1938, a new temple was constructed, but was then torn down in 1966 to be rebuilt into eight new buildings. In 1977, the temple name was changed to ‚ÄòHeungnyunsa,‚Äô which it is still known as today. <br><br>\n\nHeungnyunsa Temple is adjacent to  Songdo International City. The Memorial Park for the Incheon Landing Operation is located right near the entrance of the temple. \n\n<br><br>Though the view from the temple is eye-catching at any time of day, the view at twilight is particularly stunning. Those who are hoping for a longer look at temple life are encouraged to enroll in the Heungnyunsa temple stay, which guides visitors in experiencing Korean Buddhism.<br><br>\n\nThe temple also operates a meditation center and a Manbuljeon Hall, a room that enshrines thousands of Buddha. A high-tech memorial center is open for visitors wishing to pay tribute to their ancestors.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-32-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-32-832-1133|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-11-1660228654791/1238971_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660228654791/1238971_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660228654791/1239031_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660228654791/1239031_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660228654791/1239161_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660228654791/1239161_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660228654791/1239167_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660228654791/1239167_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660228654791/1239170_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660228654791/1239170_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660228654791/1239190_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660228654791/1239190_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660228654791/1239192_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660228654791/1239192_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660228654791/1578812_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660228654791/1578812_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660228654791/1578816_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660228654791/1578816_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660228654791/1238921_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660228654791/1238921_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-32-832-1133](tel:+82328321133)\n- [üè†www.hrt.kr</a><br><a href=\"https://www.yeonsu.go.kr/tour/tourism/mountain/mountain.asp?page=v&tour_idx=7&listCnt=&keyfield=&keyword=&gotopage=2&strCategory=\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"ÏÉàÏ∞Ω : Ïó∞ÏàòÍµ¨Ï≤≠ ÏÇ¨Ïù¥Ìä∏Î°ú Ïù¥Îèô\">www.yeonsu.go.kr](http://www.hrt.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.4169742897\nlongitude: 126.6599598009\ntitle: 40-17, Cheongnyang-ro 70beon-gil, Yeonsu-gu, Incheon\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-11-1660228654791","title":"Incheon Heungnyunsa Temple (Ìù•Î•úÏÇ¨(Ïù∏Ï≤ú))","description":"Heungnyunsa Temple, located in Dongchun-dong, Yeonsu-gu, Incheon, was established approximately 613 years ago, in the second year of King Wu of Goryeo dynasty by Preceptor Naong, a royal monk of King Gongmin.

Salted Baendaengi also makes an excellent side-dish for Korean meals. <br> <br>* Baendaengi is one of many types of small prey fish referred to as ‚ÄòSoeo‚Äô for their fierce struggle in fishing nets. Soeo have internal organs that are proportionally smaller than other species of fish and are known for their feisty nature.

During the Byeonginyangyo (the French invasion in 1866), the French fleet stayed in Ganghwado for about a month until they withdrew their forces after losing during the Jeongjoksanseong Battle. During the Sinmiyangyo (the United States expedition to Korea in 1981), the American fleet attacked Chojijin Fortress, Deokjinjin Fortress and Gwangseongbo Fortress. Hence, Ganghwado played a big part in South Korea opening its doors to the West in the 19th century. Ganghwado also became the Western Christian missionaries' center of activity for their missionary works.<br><br>There are three remaining churches that were built in that time that were  influenced or built by the Western Christian Missionaries  Ganghwa Anglican Church established in 1900, Ganghwa St. Andrew's Church established in 1906, and Ganghwa Seodo Central Church established in 1923. <br><br>Ganghwa Seodo Central Church started contruction in February 1923 and was completed as a Korean-architecture chapel in July 1923.

The church belongs to The Korean Methodist Church.<br><br>Even though the building of the church doesn't reflect outstanding building techniques and aesthetic qualities, a Western church with a Korean-style wooden structure such as Ganghwa Seodo Central Church is still worth a visit.","regDate":"2022-08-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Holy Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-08-13-1660387217022"},{"id":"2022-08-13-1660368996299","title":"Ganghwa Gyodongdo Island (ÍµêÎèôÎèÑ(Í∞ïÌôî))","description":"Gyodongdo Island is located northwest of the larger Ganghwado Island, and was made more accessible with the opening of Gyodongdaegyo Bridge in July 2014. The name changed with different dynasties, being Gomokgeunhyeon during the Goguryeo Era and Gyodonghyeon under the reign of Silla King Gyeongdeok. The island served as an important stopover point for ambassadors and envoys heading to China. Popular attractions on the island now include Daeryong Market, an alleyway market decorated with colorful murals and statues, and Manghyangdae Memorial, a gathering place for refugees who fled from the nearby Hwanghaedo Island during the Korean War. Many of the houses on Gyodongdo Island have swallow nests under the eaves. The refugees consider the swallows as guests from their hometowns. As such, the island is home to the peace & reunion themed Gyodong Swallow House, Peace Trail, and Gyodong Studio. Gyodong Swallow House serves as an exhibition and performance space. The Peace Trail is a biking path around the island. At Gyodong Studio, visitors can put on old school uniforms and take black-and-white photographs.","regDate":"2022-08-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-13-1660368996299/1890654_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-08-13-1660368996299"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
