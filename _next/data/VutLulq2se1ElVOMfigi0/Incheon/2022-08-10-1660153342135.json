The site was designated as Historic Site No. 259 in 1977. Seonwonsa Temple was built by General Choi Wu in 1245 (the 32nd year of King Gojong‚Äôs reign during the Goryeo dynasty), which was right after the transfer of the capital to Ganghwado during resistance against the Mongolian invasion. <br><br>The temple was meant to be a spiritual mainstay in fighting against Mongolia. It used to be one of the two largest temples in Korea along with Songgwangsa Temple. However, the temple was completely destroyed during the early Joseon era, leaving only the site itself. The famous wood blocks of Palman Daejanggyeong (the Tripitaka Koreana), currently housed in Haeinsa Temple at Hapcheon, are said to have been originally stored in Seonwonsa Temple. It is believed that the carved wood blocks were taken from Seonwonsa to Heungcheonsa Temple during the Joseon era and again moved to Haeinsa Temple during the reign of Sejo. <br><br>Located on a mountain slope, the presumed location of the building site extends 250 meters from south to north and 170 meters from east to west.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-32-933-8234|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-10-1660153342135/1577245_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-10-1660153342135/1577245_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-10-1660153342135/1577246_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-10-1660153342135/1577246_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-10-1660153342135/2512573_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-10-1660153342135/2512573_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-10-1660153342135/2512575_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-10-1660153342135/2512575_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-10-1660153342135/2512577_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-10-1660153342135/2512577_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-10-1660153342135/2512595_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-10-1660153342135/2512595_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-10-1660153342135/2512599_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-10-1660153342135/2512599_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-10-1660153342135/2512600_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-10-1660153342135/2512600_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-10-1660153342135/2512603_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-10-1660153342135/2512603_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-32-933-8234](tel:+82329338234)\n- [üè†www.ganghwa.go.kr</a> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br> <a title=\"New window popup\" class=\"web\" href=\"http://www.cha.go.kr/\" target=\"_blank\">www.cha.go.kr](http://www.ganghwa.go.kr/open_content/tour)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.7188945331\nlongitude: 126.4925194801\ntitle: 222, Seonwonsaji-ro, Ganghwa-gun, Incheon\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>From Seoul to Ganghwa<br>1) Sinchon Station (Seoul Subway Line 2), Exit 4.<br>-Go \nstraight 260m to arrive at the bus stop in front of Artreon.<br>-From the bus \nstop, take Bus 3000 to Ganghwa Bus Terminal. \n<br><br>2) Yeongdeungpo Station (Seoul Subway Line 1).<br>-Across from Shinsegae Department \nStore, take Bus 88 to Ganghwa Terminal. <br><br>[Taxi]<br>From Ganghwa Bus Terminal, take \na taxi to Seonwonsa Temple Site (20min).\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-10-1660153342135","title":"Ganghwa Seonwonsa Temple Site (Í∞ïÌôî ÏÑ†ÏõêÏÇ¨ÏßÄ)","description":"Ganghwa Seonwonsa Temple Site was first discovered in 1976 during a surface examination around Ganghwado Island undertaken by the Ganghwado Island Academic Research Team of Dongguk University.

While the water is cool and sweet, legend has it that it dries up or turns murky in times of national crisis.

Salted Baendaengi also makes an excellent side-dish for Korean meals. <br> <br>* Baendaengi is one of many types of small prey fish referred to as ‚ÄòSoeo‚Äô for their fierce struggle in fishing nets. Soeo have internal organs that are proportionally smaller than other species of fish and are known for their feisty nature.

During the Byeonginyangyo (the French invasion in 1866), the French fleet stayed in Ganghwado for about a month until they withdrew their forces after losing during the Jeongjoksanseong Battle. During the Sinmiyangyo (the United States expedition to Korea in 1981), the American fleet attacked Chojijin Fortress, Deokjinjin Fortress and Gwangseongbo Fortress. Hence, Ganghwado played a big part in South Korea opening its doors to the West in the 19th century. Ganghwado also became the Western Christian missionaries' center of activity for their missionary works.<br><br>There are three remaining churches that were built in that time that were  influenced or built by the Western Christian Missionaries  Ganghwa Anglican Church established in 1900, Ganghwa St. Andrew's Church established in 1906, and Ganghwa Seodo Central Church established in 1923. <br><br>Ganghwa Seodo Central Church started contruction in February 1923 and was completed as a Korean-architecture chapel in July 1923.

The church belongs to The Korean Methodist Church.<br><br>Even though the building of the church doesn't reflect outstanding building techniques and aesthetic qualities, a Western church with a Korean-style wooden structure such as Ganghwa Seodo Central Church is still worth a visit.","regDate":"2022-08-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Holy Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-08-13-1660387217022"},{"id":"2022-08-13-1660368996299","title":"Ganghwa Gyodongdo Island (ÍµêÎèôÎèÑ(Í∞ïÌôî))","description":"Gyodongdo Island is located northwest of the larger Ganghwado Island, and was made more accessible with the opening of Gyodongdaegyo Bridge in July 2014. The name changed with different dynasties, being Gomokgeunhyeon during the Goguryeo Era and Gyodonghyeon under the reign of Silla King Gyeongdeok. The island served as an important stopover point for ambassadors and envoys heading to China. Popular attractions on the island now include Daeryong Market, an alleyway market decorated with colorful murals and statues, and Manghyangdae Memorial, a gathering place for refugees who fled from the nearby Hwanghaedo Island during the Korean War. Many of the houses on Gyodongdo Island have swallow nests under the eaves. The refugees consider the swallows as guests from their hometowns. As such, the island is home to the peace & reunion themed Gyodong Swallow House, Peace Trail, and Gyodong Studio. Gyodong Swallow House serves as an exhibition and performance space. The Peace Trail is a biking path around the island. At Gyodong Studio, visitors can put on old school uniforms and take black-and-white photographs.","regDate":"2022-08-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-13-1660368996299/1890654_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-08-13-1660368996299"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
