Sanggoji is the on-site restaurant, and means rainbow in the local dialect. Carbon hot springs are known to have health benefits for the heart, as carbonic acid gas is absorbed in the skin, stimulating capillary vessels and expanding blood vessels. This enhances blood circulation, lowering blood pressure and reducing the burden on the heart.","regDate":"2023-02-17","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Hot Springs & Spa"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-17-1676612149553/1620176_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-17-1676612149553"},{"id":"2023-02-17-1676608827342","title":"Jeju Island Special Tourist Zone (Ï†úÏ£ºÎèÑ Í¥ÄÍ¥ëÌäπÍµ¨)","description":"Jeju Island, designated as Jeju Special Autonomous Province, lies southwest of the Korean Peninsula and is the largest tourist destination in Korea. The whole island was designated as a special tourist zone, and wherever tourists go, they can look upon beautiful scenery. Every year, about 8.7 million people from Korea and abroad visit this fascinating island that measures 73 kilometers across, east to west, and 31 kilometers, from north to south.<br>Jeju Island earned the UNESCO triple crown, being designated as a World Natural Heritage, Global Geopark, and Biosphere Reserve as well as one of the Seven Wonders of Nature. The climate of Jeju is quite different from the temperate climate of mainland Korea. Since the island has a subtropical climate as well as a subarctic one, there are many peculiar plants that can only to be found on this island. The unique sight of Jeju Island captivates travelers. The scenery that represents this volcanic island of Jeju, such as Jusangjeolli Cliff (columnar joints on the coast) were created by Hallasan Mountain and Oreum (parasitic cones in Jeju dialect). The piedmont area that visitors encounter on their way from the beach to Hallasan Mountain is a gift of nature and the piedmont area on the way to Geomunoreum Volcanic Cone, where Jeju World Natural Heritage Center is located, is worth seeing. Another unique aspect here is the Jeju dialect and lifestyle.<br>Traveling the 182-kilometer circuit road along the coastline by car, motor scooter or bike is recommended. There is a trail for walking called ‚ÄúJeju Olle-gil‚Äù for those who choose to make a round trip on foot. Jeju Island is implementing more discretionary and diversified policies in politics and economy as well as tourism, and this is what makes Jeju worthy of the name ‚Äúfree international city.‚Äù","regDate":"2023-02-17","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Tourist Complexes"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-17-1676608827342/1620163_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-17-1676608827342"},{"id":"2023-02-17-1676605198655","title":"Jeju Glass Castle (Ï†úÏ£ºÏú†Î¶¨ÏùòÏÑ±)","description":"Visitors to Jeju Glass Castle will be entranced by its magical atmosphere.
