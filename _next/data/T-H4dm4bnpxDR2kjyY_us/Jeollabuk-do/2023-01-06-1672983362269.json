According to Samgukyusa (historical records published in 1281), King Mu (30th king of Baekje, in power AD 600-641) and his wife Queen Seonhwa were said to have seen a vision of Mireuksamjon (the three Sanskrit) emerging from a large pond. At the time of their revelation, the king and queen were on their way to visit a Buddhist monk in Sajasa Temple on Yonghwasan Mountain (now known as Mireuksan Mountain). In response to their vision, the king drained the nearby pond and established Mireuksa Temple. The temple is believed to have shown the most advanced architectural and cultural skills of Baekje, Silla, and Goguryeo (the three main kingdoms at that time). Records indicate that King Jinpyeong of Silla even sent his craftsmen over to assist with the temple construction. <br><br>The two main features of the Mireuksa Temple Site are the stone pagoda (Mireuksaji Seoktap) and the flagpole supports (Mireuksaji Dangganjiju). The 14.24-meter-high west stone pagoda (National Treasure No. 11) is the oldest and largest Korean stone pagoda in existence. The west pagoda currently has only six tiers, but is estimated to originally have had nine. The nine-story east stone pagoda (27.67 meters in x_height) was restored to its original stature in 1993 based on historical records. Other surviving landmarks include the flagpole supports (Treasure No. 236) to the south of the stone pagodas. The 395 centimeter-tall poles are estimated to have been created during the Unified Silla period (AD 676-935) and are set 90 meters apart from east to west.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-63-859-3873,<br> +82-63-830-0900|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|[Mireuksa Temple Site] N/A (Open all year round)<br>[Iksan National Museum] New Year‚Äôs Day, Mondays, the day of Seollal (Lunar New Year's Day) & Chuseok (Korean Thanksgiving Day)|\n|usetime:|[Mireuksa Temple Site] Open 24 hr<br>[Iksan National Museum] 10:00-17:30|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Information material available in English, Japanese and Chinese at the Exhibition Hall entrance|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-06-1672983362269/2514985_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-06-1672983362269/2514985_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-06-1672983362269/2514986_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-06-1672983362269/2514986_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-06-1672983362269/2514987_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-06-1672983362269/2514987_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-06-1672983362269/2514989_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-06-1672983362269/2514989_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-06-1672983362269/2514993_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-06-1672983362269/2514993_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-06-1672983362269/2514994_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-06-1672983362269/2514994_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-63-859-3873](tel:+82638593873)\n- [üè†www.iksan.go.kr/tour</a><br /><a href=\"http://iksan.museum.go.kr/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"web\">iksan.museum.go.kr](http://www.iksan.go.kr/tour/index.iksan)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.0125952250\nlongitude: 127.0308309191\ntitle: 362, Mireuksaji-ro, Iksan-si, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-06-1672983362269","title":"Mireuksa Temple Site [UNESCO World Heritage] (ÏùµÏÇ∞ ÎØ∏Î•µÏÇ¨ÏßÄ [Ïú†ÎÑ§Ïä§ÏΩî ÏÑ∏Í≥ÑÎ¨∏ÌôîÏú†ÏÇ∞])","description":"Mireuksa was the largest Buddhist temple of the ancient Baekje Kingdom (18 BC-AD 660).

They are originally enshrined in Gyeonggijeon Shrine and Jogyeongmyo Shrine, and when Jeonju had fallen during the Donghak Peasant Revolution, the portrait and tablet were moved to a small palace inside the fortress.

For many years the temple lay incomplete until Monk Bojo Chejing began reconstruction in the 7th year of King Gyeongmun of Silla (AD 867). The temple was destroyed at one point in time, but Master Monk Jinul prayed that it be rebuilt. In accordance with his fervent hopes, in the 1600s the monk‚Äôs followers rebuilt a number of the temple‚Äôs halls and buildings, many of which can still be seen today. The temple is also remembered as the temple that King Injo helped rebuild with the hope that his two sons, who had been taken hostage by the Qing dynasty during the Byeongjahoran War (Chinese invasion of Korea in 1636), would be returned safely and that Buddha would heal the nation.<br><br> One of the Korea‚Äôs four major temples, Songgwangsa is home to Jijangbosal and Siwangsang statues (found in Jijangjeon Hall), a Seokgayeorae statue, and 500 Nahansang statues (found in Nahanjeon Hall).
