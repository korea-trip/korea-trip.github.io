They are originally enshrined in Gyeonggijeon Shrine and Jogyeongmyo Shrine, and when Jeonju had fallen during the Donghak Peasant Revolution, the portrait and tablet were moved to a small palace inside the fortress. The original fortress walls were 16 kilometers in circumference with three gates in the north, east, and west, but only a half-moon shaped western gate remains standing today.","regDate":"2023-01-11","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Nature","Natural Sites","County Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-11-1673415344453/1606418_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-11-1673415344453"},{"id":"2023-01-11-1673408186662","title":"Wibongpokpo Falls (위봉폭포)","description":"Located in the eastern section of Wibongsanseong Fortress, Wibongpokpo Falls is a two-tiered waterfall measuring 60 meters high.

For many years the temple lay incomplete until Monk Bojo Chejing began reconstruction in the 7th year of King Gyeongmun of Silla (AD 867). The temple was destroyed at one point in time, but Master Monk Jinul prayed that it be rebuilt. In accordance with his fervent hopes, in the 1600s the monk’s followers rebuilt a number of the temple’s halls and buildings, many of which can still be seen today. The temple is also remembered as the temple that King Injo helped rebuild with the hope that his two sons, who had been taken hostage by the Qing dynasty during the Byeongjahoran War (Chinese invasion of Korea in 1636), would be returned safely and that Buddha would heal the nation.<br><br> One of the Korea’s four major temples, Songgwangsa is home to Jijangbosal and Siwangsang statues (found in Jijangjeon Hall), a Seokgayeorae statue, and 500 Nahansang statues (found in Nahanjeon Hall). The temple is also home to eight Tangible Cultural Assets and four Treasured Cultural Assets  Daeungjeon Hall, the Samsebulsang statues, the bell-tower, and the Sacheonwangsang statue.<br><br>Beloved for its historical significance as well as its beauty, the temple draws throngs of worshipers throughout the year. In spring, many tourists flock to the area to explore the temple and walk through the nearby cherry blossom tunnels. A worthwhile attraction for visitors of all ages, the temple is particularly well-suited for those with mobility problems since it is located on ground level.","regDate":"2023-01-10","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-10-1673343382073/215448_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-10-1673343382073","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-10-1673343382073"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
