While passing under this tree, he looked up and saw that his royal sedan chair was about to be ensnared in the tree’s branches. As he called for his bearers to look out, the branches suddenly lifted for the royal procession to proceed. On his way to Seoul, King Sejo was also able to take shelter from a rain shower under this tree. Therefore, he bestowed upon the tree the ministerial rank of Jeongipum.","regDate":"2022-10-27","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-27-1666867510265/220580_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Chungcheongbuk-do/2022-10-27-1666867510265"},{"id":"2022-07-27-1658964977052","title":"Jeongbangsa Temple (정방사)","description":"Located on a ridge of Sinseonbong Peak (845 meters) nearby Geumsusan Mountain, Jeongbangsa Temple was founded by Buddhist Monk Uisang in the second year (662) of King Munmu’s reign during the Silla dynasty.
