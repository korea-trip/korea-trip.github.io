Its perimeter is approximately 1.8 kilometers, the x_height is 5 meters, and total area is 196,381 m¬≤, making it a huge fortress.

Upon arrival, they were tortured to death. In particular, approximately 1,000 people are recorded as having been executed during the persecution in 1866. <br><br>The plaza inside of the fortress has a prison site where Catholics were chained up under the Daewongun government, and a gigantic old tree which was the tree used for torturing.

The topographical features are what make this mountain stand out and its mysterious folklore is what makes it so interesting. The park features many peaks, including the main peak Cheonhwangbong (alt. 845.1 m), as well as Sambulbong, Yeoncheonbong, and Gwaneumbong Peaks. This mountain is famous for its many interesting sites, with its fantastic rock structures and Yongmunpokpo Falls on the west, Eunseonpokpo Falls to the east, and Amyongchu and Sutyongchupokpo Falls in the south. <br><Br>In spring, cherry blossoms bloom along the path to Donghaksa Temple, and during summer the lush green of the valley is very beautiful.

Other historians, however, believe that the fortress was already in place by AD 500 and modified in 605 into the structure we see today. In either case, some parts of the fortress were reconstructed during the Unified Silla period (676-935) and modified again in the Goryeo (918-1392) and Joseon (1392-1910) eras. <br><br>Busosan Mountain is home to historic landmarks from the Baekje kingdom, including the archaeological site in Gwanbuk-ri, located just in front of Buseosanseong Fortress.
