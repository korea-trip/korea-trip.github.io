The large site is filled with traces of Baekje culture. Sabigung Palace is a reconstruction of a real royal palace from the Three Kingdoms period. Neungsa Temple, a royal temple representing the Baekje period, has been recreated according to the real size based on excavation research done at the historic site in Neungsan-ri, Buyeo-eup. Just inside Daetongmun Gate is the Five-story Stone Pagoda, the most prominent structure in the complex. Wiryeseong Fortress, built during the Hanseong Baekje Era, gives a different aspect of Baekje in comparison with Sabigung Palace from the Late Baekje Era.

Its perimeter is approximately 1.8 kilometers, the x_height is 5 meters, and total area is 196,381 m¬≤, making it a huge fortress. Through restoration and purification projects, its old image has been restored as a historic park and it is famous as a site of Catholic martyrs in the late Joseon era. <br><br>During the persecution of Catholics, many Catholics from Chungcheong-do were forced to come to Haemieupseong Walled Town where the administration office was located. Upon arrival, they were tortured to death. In particular, approximately 1,000 people are recorded as having been executed during the persecution in 1866. <br><br>The plaza inside of the fortress has a prison site where Catholics were chained up under the Daewongun government, and a gigantic old tree which was the tree used for torturing.

The topographical features are what make this mountain stand out and its mysterious folklore is what makes it so interesting. The park features many peaks, including the main peak Cheonhwangbong (alt. 845.1 m), as well as Sambulbong, Yeoncheonbong, and Gwaneumbong Peaks. This mountain is famous for its many interesting sites, with its fantastic rock structures and Yongmunpokpo Falls on the west, Eunseonpokpo Falls to the east, and Amyongchu and Sutyongchupokpo Falls in the south. <br><Br>In spring, cherry blossoms bloom along the path to Donghaksa Temple, and during summer the lush green of the valley is very beautiful. During fall, the maple trees reveal their crimson colored leaves around Gapsa Temple and Yongmunpokpo Falls. The snowcapped peak of Sambulbong in winter is simply breathtaking. Gyeryongsan is full of rare animals and plants, beautiful waterfalls and a rich history with mysterious legends and cultural treasures.

Other historians, however, believe that the fortress was already in place by AD 500 and modified in 605 into the structure we see today. In either case, some parts of the fortress were reconstructed during the Unified Silla period (676-935) and modified again in the Goryeo (918-1392) and Joseon (1392-1910) eras. <br><br>Busosan Mountain is home to historic landmarks from the Baekje kingdom, including the archaeological site in Gwanbuk-ri, located just in front of Buseosanseong Fortress.

Restaurants serving delicious regional cuisine are located near the dock, making the area a recommended tourist location for visitors who are looking for a combination of natural beauty and flavorful culinary delights. <br><br>Gudeurae was designated a Korea tourist region in 1985. Following the official designation, a sculpture park housing 59 sculptures was established in the area.

The other 29 pieces are from Korean and overseas artists who participated in the International Modern Sculpture Symposium in 1999. The sculptures bring about a sense of beauty that reflects the region‚Äôs history as well as modern art, making the park a popular tourist site and retreat for residents.
