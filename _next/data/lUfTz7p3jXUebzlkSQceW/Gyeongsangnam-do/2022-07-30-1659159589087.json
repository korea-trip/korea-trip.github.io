This valley is Baegundonggyegok Valley.  For almost 6 km, the water of the valley flows over only rocks, with over twenty large and small falls and lakes.  Large stones in the valley are gorgeous because the stones are washed with sunbeams and the strong current of water.  The most famous falls are Baeunpokpo Waterfall and Odampokpo Waterfall.  Strong current of water flows in Deungcheondae, where the letters ‚ÄòYeongnamjeilcheonsok‚Äô are carved.  Baegundonggyegok Valley is a clean area due to maintenance of the clean natural environment.  Many tourists visit here because the valley is decorated with azaleas in the spring and it is cool in the summer.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-55-970-6421~3|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-30-1659159589087/1889976_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659159589087/1889976_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659159589087/1889977_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659159589087/1889977_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-30-1659159589087/1889980_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-30-1659159589087/1889980_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-55-970-6421~3](tel:+82559706421~3)\n- [üè†www.sancheong.go.kr](http://www.sancheong.go.kr/tour/index.do)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.2963413776\nlongitude: 127.8835964068\ntitle: Baegun-ro 51beon-gil, Danseong-myeon, Sancheong-gun, Gyeongsangnam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \nFrom Seoul Nambu Bus Terminal, take an intercity bus  to Sancheong Intercity Bus Terminal.Take a taxi for approx. 30 min. to the valley.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-30-1659159589087","title":"Baegundonggyegok Valley, Sancheong (Î∞±Ïö¥ÎèôÍ≥ÑÍ≥°(ÏÇ∞Ï≤≠))","description":"If you go 5 km up along the valley at Baegam-ri, under the thick woods, you will find a 180 square meter long stone named ‚ÄòJeomjeong Rock‚Äô and a small waterfall.

It is said to have been built to appease the spirit of a young woman named Arang, who met an unfortunate death. <br><br>According to the legend, Arang was mistakenly killed by a low-ranking officer who had loved her and tried to hug her. After her death, she becomes a ghost and appears to every district magistrate (highest-ranking officer in a region) to appeal for the investigation of her unfair death, but each district magistrate dies of a heart attack. <br><br>Then, a new district magistrate by the name Lee is dispatched to the area. Unlike his predecessors, Lee listens to the story of the ghost and finds the low-ranked officer who had killed her and punishes him. He found Arang‚Äôs body and holded a religious ceremony on her behalf. Aranggak was also built in her memory. <br><br>Every year, an event called Arangje is held on April 16 by the lunar calendar in Aranggak Pavilion. Young maidens dressed in white hanbok perform a religious ceremony to soothe the sorrow of Arang. There is also a saying that the spirit of Arang will preserve the love of those couples who visit the pavilion together.","regDate":"2022-07-30","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-30-1659154895976/574085_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-07-30-1659154895976","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-07-30-1659154895976"},{"id":"2022-07-30-1659149972284","title":"Anmingogae Hill (ÏïàÎØºÍ≥†Í∞ú)","description":"Anmingogae Hill is a 9-kilometer-long hill that stretches from Taebaek-dong in Jinhae to Anmin-dong in Changwon.
