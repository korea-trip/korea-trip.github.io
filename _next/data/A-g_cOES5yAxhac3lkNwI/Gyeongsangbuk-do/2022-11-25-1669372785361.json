Flowing down from Sobaeksan Mountain and Taebaeksan Mountain, Naeseongcheon Stream and Yeongjucheon Stream converge and loop around Museom Village, surrounding the village on three sides with water. This peninsula-like village is not only the center of traditional Korean culture, but also has a gorgeous natural landscape complete with a wide sandy riverside and a lush inland forest.<br><br>Known for Haeudang and Manjukje Houses (two of the most historical hanok houses in the area), the village is also home to other outstanding traditional houses such as the Kim Gyu-jin House and the Kim Wi-jin House. Manjukje House is located at the heart of the village and  the oldest traditional house in this hanok village. Manjukje was built in 1666 (7th year of King Heonjongs reign) by Bak Su (the father of the Bannam Bak Family).<br><br> Nearby Manjukje is Manun House, built in the early 19th century and named after Kim Hwi-geol (penname “Manun”).

It is a tiny bridge in terms of x_width (30 cm), but it stretches for over 150 meters. It is said that the bridge was rebuilt annually after being destroyed each rainy season. With the construction of Sudo Bridge, the Single Log Bridge was no longer needed, but was rebuilt some time later in its original form. To celebrate the bridge’s impressive history, the village hosts the Single-Log Bridge Festival every October.","regDate":"2022-12-10","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Folk Villages"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-10-1670654386426/2563076_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-10-1670654386426"},{"id":"2022-12-10-1670650568186","title":"Yeongju Huibangsa Temple (희방사(영주))","description":"Four kilometers northeast of Huibang Station is Huibangsa Temple, which is located at the foot of Sobaeksan Mountain.
