The beautifully formed rock towers high into the sky and resembles a candlestick, from which it gets its name. Chotdaebawi Rock and the nearby rock formations seem to change the shape they resemble along with the waves that crash against the rocks. The view of the sunrise from behind Chotdaebawi Rock is so popular that it attracts photographers and tourists nationwide.\n<br><br>\n* The Legend of Chotdaebawi Rock<br>\nOnce upon a time, there was a man who lived in Chuam who had a concubine. His wife was jealous of the second wife and the conflict between the two women continually escalated. One day, god became enraged over their continual quarreling and threw lighting down from heaven, striking both women dead. The newly-made widower missed his wives so much that he remained frozen in his loneliness and eventually turned into a rock, which is now called Chotdaebawi Rock.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|expagerange:|Open to visitors of all ages|\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-33-530-2801|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Open 24 hr|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Available Facilities:|Restaurants, accommodations, etc.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-25-1658748901695/2363917_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658748901695/2363917_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658748901695/2363918_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658748901695/2363918_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658748901695/2363919_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658748901695/2363919_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658748901695/2363920_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658748901695/2363920_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658748901695/2653696_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658748901695/2653696_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658748901695/2653698_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658748901695/2653698_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658748901695/2653701_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658748901695/2653701_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658748901695/2653703_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658748901695/2653703_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658748901695/2716605_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658748901695/2716605_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658748901695/2716606_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658748901695/2716606_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-33-530-2801](tel:+82335302801)\n- [üè†www.dh.go.kr/tour](http://www.dh.go.kr/tour/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.4790136061\nlongitude: 129.1586182867\ntitle: 17-1, Chotdaebawi-gil, Donghae-si, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-25-1658748901695","title":"Chuam Chotdaebawi Rock (Ï∂îÏïî Ï¥õÎåÄÎ∞îÏúÑ)","description":"Chuam Chotdaebawi Rock in Donghae-si, Gangwon-do is one of Korea‚Äôs most famous tourist attractions.
