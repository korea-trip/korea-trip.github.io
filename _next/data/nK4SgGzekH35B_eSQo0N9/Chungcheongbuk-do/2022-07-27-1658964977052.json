While passing under this tree, he looked up and saw that his royal sedan chair was about to be ensnared in the tree’s branches. As he called for his bearers to look out, the branches suddenly lifted for the royal procession to proceed. On his way to Seoul, King Sejo was also able to take shelter from a rain shower under this tree.
