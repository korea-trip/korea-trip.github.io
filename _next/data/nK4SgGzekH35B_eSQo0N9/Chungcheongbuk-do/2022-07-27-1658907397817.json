The cave features stairway structure and contains an abundance of beautiful stalagmites and stalactites. The average temperature of the cave maintains 14 degrees Celsius in summer and 16 degrees Celsius in winter, making it a perfect all-year-round attraction. The cave is rich in underground water resources and there is a 0.8 to 1 meter-deep cave river flowing at the bottom of the cave floor. The cave also has over 40 small ponds that are inhabited by a variety of living organisms like fish and insects. <br><br>\n\nSituated on top of the mountain peak to the left of the cave is Ondalsanseong Fortress.
