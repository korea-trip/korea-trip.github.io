The Bukhansan National Park covers both Bukhansan and Dobongsan Mountains, and spans the total area of 80.699 „é¢. At the top of Bukhansan Mountain are Baegundae Terrace (835.6 m), Insubong Peak (810.5 m) and Mangyeongdae Terrace (799.5 m), which gave the mountain the nickname \"Samgaksan\" or the \"three-horned mountain.\" The mountain had other names: Sambongsan (mountain with three peaks), Hwasan (flower mountain), and Buaak (mountain shaped like a person giving a baby a piggyback ride). The current name, Bukhansan, was given after the Bukhansanseong Fortress was built under King Sukjong of the Joseon dynasty.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-2-909-0498|\n|parking:|Available (Bukhansanseong Parking Lots 1 & 2, Jeongneung Parking Lot)|\n|restdate:|* Subject to abrupt closure due to adverse weather conditions.|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Mountain Not Access Period:|Period of restricted access for fire-prevention and natural scenery maintenance, natural environment protection, and forest protection<br>[Hiking Trails]<br>Spring: March 2-April 30 / Fall: November 1-December 15<br>[National Park]<br>November 15-December 15 (Except Gyeongju & Taean shoreline)<br>* TBD by park directors based on fire weather advisories, precipitation levels, and other local conditions.

It wasn't until 1593 that the palace was used as a temporary palace of the royal family after their home was burned down during the Imjin War. King Seonjo also stayed at Deoksugung Palace after returning to the city. It became a proper palace when Gwanghaegun (1575-1641) ascended to the throne and gave this royal residence the name Gyeongungung Palace in 1611. Over the following decades, the palace alternated between being an official palace and a temporary residence. The name did not change officially to Deoksugung Palace, meaning the ‚Äúpalace of virtuous longevity,‚Äù until 1907. While the palace once encompassed a vast area with many buildings, the current palace grounds are just a small shadow of the prior splendor, with very few structures remaining.","regDate":"2022-07-22","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Palaces"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-22-1658472507467/1946565_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-07-22-1658472507467"},{"id":"2022-07-22-1658468566302","title":"Daraenamu Tree in Changdeokgung Palace (Ï∞ΩÎçïÍ∂Å Îã§ÎûòÎÇòÎ¨¥)","description":"Daraenamu Tree in Changdeokgung Palace is estimated to be 600 years old, meaning it had likely been planted before the palace was built.
