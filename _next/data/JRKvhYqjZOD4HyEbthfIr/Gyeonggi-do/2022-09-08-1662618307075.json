This structure was built on the western side of Namhansanseong Fortress as one of the four command posts. During the Manchu Invasion of 1636, King Injo personally commanded and encouraged the troops from here. They held out for 45 days against a Qing force of 120,000, before finally being forced to surrender and accept vassal status to the Manchu Empire.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-31-760-4821|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-09-08-1662618307075/1957745_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-08-1662618307075/1957745_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-08-1662618307075/1957749_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-08-1662618307075/1957749_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-08-1662618307075/1957750_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-08-1662618307075/1957750_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-08-1662618307075/1957751_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-08-1662618307075/1957751_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-08-1662618307075/1957752_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-08-1662618307075/1957752_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-08-1662618307075/1957744_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-08-1662618307075/1957744_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-08-1662618307075/1957748_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-08-1662618307075/1957748_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-31-760-4821](tel:+82317604821)\n- [üè†www.gjcity.go.kr</a> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br><a title=\"new page popup\" href=\"http://www.cha.go.kr\" target=\"_blank\">www.cha.go.kr](http://www.gjcity.go.kr/tour/main.do)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.4798539882\nlongitude: 127.1765554537\ntitle: 107-65, Namhansanseong-ro 780beon-gil, Gwangju-si, Gyeonggi-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nSanseong Station (Seoul Subway Line 8), Exit 1<br>\nWalk straight, following the main road at the intersection.<br>\nFrom Korea Polytech University Bus Stop, take Bus No. 9 or 52.<br>\nGet off at Namhansanseong Fortress Bus Stop.<br>\nTake the trail to reach Sueojangdae Post.\n","data":{"id":"2022-09-08-1662618307075","title":"Sueojangdae Post (ÏàòÏñ¥Ïû•ÎåÄ)","description":"Sueojangdae Post (Defense Commander's Post) is a two-story military facility used as a lookout post as well as for directing battles.

The trail that starts from Yangpyeong leads to an expansive and open grassland. The hiking trails are also connected to those of Mount Daebusan and Mount Sogunisan.
