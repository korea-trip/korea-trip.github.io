Located just south of Seongsan Ilchulbong Tuff Cone, the cape is a popular tourist attraction. The tuff cone along with a beautiful vista of the ocean and fields of canola flowers can easily be seen from the peak of Seopjikoji. On top of the hill stands a beacon fire station, reaching 4 meters in x_height with a diameter of 9 meters, built using volcanic rocks. Behind the beacon fire station is Bulgeunoreum Volcanic Cone, vibrant with red soil. The white lighthouse atop the cone stands out in contrast. Seopjikoji has been used as a filming site for many Korean movies and dramas.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ Jeju Travel Hotline: +82-64-740-6000|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Film Locations:|Various Korean dramas & movies|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-02-12-1676198173474/2513477_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-12-1676198173474/2513477_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-12-1676198173474/2513483_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-12-1676198173474/2513483_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-12-1676198173474/2513484_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-12-1676198173474/2513484_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-12-1676198173474/2513485_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-12-1676198173474/2513485_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-64-740-6000](tel:+82647406000)\n- [üè†www.visitjeju.net](http://www.visitjeju.net/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.4302500880\nlongitude: 126.9280674087\ntitle: 107, Seopjikoji-ro, Seogwipo-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus + Taxi]<br>\n From Seogwipo Intercity Bus Terminal, take Bus No. 910 and get off at Seopjikoji Bus Stop.<br> <br>\nFrom the bus stop, take a taxi for approx. 5 min to Seopjikoji Entrance.\n","data":{"id":"2023-02-12-1676198173474","title":"Seopjikoji (ÏÑ≠ÏßÄÏΩîÏßÄ)","description":"Seopjikoji gets its name from its shape, jutting out to sea, with koji being the Jeju dialect for a cape.
