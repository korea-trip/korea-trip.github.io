Cultural properties in the folk village have been handed down from generation to generation and include treasures such as residential houses, Confucian shrines and schools, ancient government offices, stone statues, large millstones (pulled by horses or ox), fortress ruins, and stone monuments. Among the cultural gems of the folk village are intangible cultural assets such as folk plays, native foods, local folk craftsmanship, and local dialect. Even the trees are an important part of the area’s heritage. Several zelkova and nettle trees that are hundreds of years old stand at the center of the village, preserving the dignified atmosphere of a bygone era. <br><br> The Seongeup Folk Village shows the unique culture of Jeju Island. The local tongsi (traditional Jeju restroom) are especially well-known characteristics of Jeju folk culture.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-64-710-6797|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Tour Course Information:|South Gate → Yeonjamae (ox-pulled millstone) & Gopyeongo’s old house → Gosangeun’s old house → Bangjuk → Jeongeuihyeon → zelkova tree & hackberry tree → lgwanheon (ancient administration building) → Leeyeongsuk’s old house → Jeongui Hyanggyo→ Hanbongil’s old house → South Gate|\n|Available Facilities:|Accomodation, restaurants etc.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-02-12-1676191105346/898566_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-12-1676191105346/898566_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-12-1676191105346/898575_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-12-1676191105346/898575_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-12-1676191105346/2364389_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-12-1676191105346/2364389_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-12-1676191105346/2364393_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-12-1676191105346/2364393_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-12-1676191105346/2455556_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-12-1676191105346/2455556_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-12-1676191105346/2455561_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-12-1676191105346/2455561_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-12-1676191105346/2455562_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-12-1676191105346/2455562_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-12-1676191105346/2455564_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-12-1676191105346/2455564_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-12-1676191105346/2455570_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-12-1676191105346/2455570_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-12-1676191105346/898556_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-12-1676191105346/898556_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-64-710-6797](tel:+82647106797)\n- [🏠www.visitjeju.net](http://www.visitjeju.net/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.3845391870\nlongitude: 126.8003906281\ntitle: 19, Seongeupjeonguihyeon-ro, Seogwipo-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Jeju Intercity Bus Terminal take an Intercity Bus to Beonnyeong-ro.<br>\nGet off at Seongeup 1(il)-ri Office Bus Stop. <br>\nGo around the corner and walk along the road for about 200m.\n","data":{"id":"2023-02-12-1676191105346","title":"Seongeup Folk Village (성읍민속마을)","description":"Located at the foot of Halla Mountain on Jeju Island, Seongeup Folk Village is a small town that holds a vast amount of culture over a wide period of time from 1410 to 1914.

Each hole is separated from the other holes by a few meters.<br><br> Legend has it that Samseonghyeol is the place where three demigods, the founding fathers of Tamna (the former name of Jeju), first appeared. They lived by hunting and gathering until&nbsp;they married three princesses from Byeokrangguk, whom came to shore in a wooden box. The three princesses brought with them a calf, pony, and five different seeds that eventually helped to establish agriculture in Jeju.<br><br> Curiously, the three holes are not percolated by rain or snow.  The ancient trees surrounding the holes look as if they are bowing to them, often surprising visitors.
