Seogwipo Submarine offers safe undersea tours in its recently acquired state of the art submarine from Finland. Munseom, where the submarine travels, is home to outstanding coral reefs, colorful schools of fish, and rich seaweed. The exquisite landscape makes it one of the most beautiful places to dive as well. Going deep into the 40 meter sea-bed, visitors can see countless fish, rare iridescent coral reefs, and a surreal-looking shipwreck with schools of fish surrounding it. Over 20 years of technical knowhow and safe operation (in fact, the longest submarine tour without a single accident on record) make Seogwipo Submarine a must-see attraction on Jeju Island.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-64-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-64-732-6060|\n|parking:|Available (buses 15 parking spaces, cars 70 parking spaces)|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|07:20 - 18:40 (Operates 18 times a day in 40 min intervals)<br>November-February operates until 16:00 <BR>July-August 07:45-18:50 (operates every 35 min.) <BR>* Operation subject to change|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Tour Course Information:|Route<br>Seogwipo Port (Boarding a Passenger Ferry) ‚Äì Munseom (Board the Submarine) ‚Äì Diver Show ‚Äì Coral Garden ‚Äì Getting off the Submarine ‚Äì Tour in Munseom ‚Äì Seogwipo Port|\n|Facility Utilization Fees:|Adults (ages 14 and older)&nbsp;55,000  won&nbsp;<br>Children (ages 3-13)&nbsp;&nbsp;36,000  won&nbsp; <br><br> *&nbsp;Please refer to the website for discount information|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-02-12-1676180133673/1618773_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-12-1676180133673/1618773_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-12-1676180133673/1618774_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-12-1676180133673/1618774_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-12-1676180133673/1618775_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-12-1676180133673/1618775_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-64-732-6060](tel:+82647326060)\n- [üè†www.submarine.co.kr](http://www.submarine.co.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.2392291431\nlongitude: 126.5587093030\ntitle: 40, Namseongjung-ro, Seogwipo-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>\nFrom Jeju International Airport, take the Airport Limousine Bus No. 600 and get off at Seogwipo Wharf Bus Stop.<br>Transfer to a bus bound for Seobugwangwang road and get off at Seogwipo Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2023-02-12-1676180133673","title":"Seogwipo Submarine (ÏÑúÍ∑ÄÌè¨Ïû†ÏàòÌï®)","description":"When it opened in 1988, Seogwipo Submarine was the first of its kind in Asia and the third in the world.

Each hole is separated from the other holes by a few meters.<br><br> Legend has it that Samseonghyeol is the place where three demigods, the founding fathers of Tamna (the former name of Jeju), first appeared. They lived by hunting and gathering until&nbsp;they married three princesses from Byeokrangguk, whom came to shore in a wooden box. The three princesses brought with them a calf, pony, and five different seeds that eventually helped to establish agriculture in Jeju.<br><br> Curiously, the three holes are not percolated by rain or snow.
