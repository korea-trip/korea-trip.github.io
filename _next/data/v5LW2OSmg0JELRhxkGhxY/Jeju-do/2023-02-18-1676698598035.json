The word “Samseonghyeol” means “three clans holes”, referring to the three 品 shaped holes in the middle of the forest. Each hole is separated from the other holes by a few meters.<br><br> Legend has it that Samseonghyeol is the place where three demigods, the founding fathers of Tamna (the former name of Jeju), first appeared. They lived by hunting and gathering until&nbsp;they married three princesses from Byeokrangguk, whom came to shore in a wooden box. The three princesses brought with them a calf, pony, and five different seeds that eventually helped to establish agriculture in Jeju.<br><br> Curiously, the three holes are not percolated by rain or snow.  The ancient trees surrounding the holes look as if they are bowing to them, often surprising visitors. It takes just about 30 minutes to look around Samseonghyeol and its vicinity.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-64-722-3315|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00 * Open at 10:00 on New Year's Day, Seollal (Lunar New Year's Day) and Chuseok (Korean Thanksgiving Day)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Parking Fees:|Daytime: 09:00-18:00<br /><br>Free for first 5 min.<br /><br>Between 5-30 min. 1,000 won<br /><br>500 won per every 15 min. after<br /><br><br /><br>Nighttime: 18:00-09:00<br /><br>Free for first 5 min.<br /><br>Between 5-30 min. 500 won<br /><br>250 won per every 15 min after<br /><br><br /><br>* Long-term parking: 1 day 10,000 won<br /><br>* Visitors to Samseonghyeol: 1 hr. 30 min. free|\n|Admission Fees:|Adults (ages 19-64) 2,500 won (2,000 won for group)<br>Teenagers (ages 13-18) 1,700 won (1,100 won for group)<br>Children (ages 7-12) 1,000 won (600 won for group)<BR>Senior citizens over 65 years old 1,000 won<BR>* Groups - 30 or more people|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Animation, Paphlet (English, Japanese, Chinese)|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-02-18-1676698598035/1618334_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-18-1676698598035/1618334_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-18-1676698598035/1618340_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-18-1676698598035/1618340_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-18-1676698598035/1618328_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-18-1676698598035/1618328_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-18-1676698598035/1618343_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-18-1676698598035/1618343_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-18-1676698598035/1618349_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-18-1676698598035/1618349_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-18-1676698598035/1618352_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-18-1676698598035/1618352_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-18-1676698598035/1618353_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-18-1676698598035/1618353_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-64-722-3315](tel:+82647223315)\n- [🏠www.samsunghyeol.or.kr](http://www.samsunghyeol.or.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.5041771692\nlongitude: 126.5289586809\ntitle: 22, Samseong-ro, Jeju-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\n From Jeju International Airport, take Bus No. 500 or 36 and get off at Samseong Elementary School Bus Stop.<br>\n - Cross Jungang-ro street and walk along the Gwangyang1-gil street. <br>\n <br>\n<br>\n From Jeju Coast Ferry Terminal, take Bus No. 92 in front of the terminal and get off at Samseong Elementary School Bus Stop.<br> Cross Jungang-ro street and walk along the Gwangyang1-gil street.\n","data":{"id":"2023-02-18-1676698598035","title":"Samseonghyeol (제주 삼성혈)","description":"Designated as Historic Site No.134, Samseonghyeol is located in the pine forest between Kal Hotel and Jeju Folklore & Natural History Museum.
