It was originally a separate island, but a build-up of sand and soil has connected it to the main island.  A large crater, formed by the hot lava mixing with cold ocean water, is located at the top of Seongsan Ilchulbong Tuff Cone. The crater is about 600 meters in diameter and 90 meters deep. It has been featured in films, and was originally used for agriculture, but has now been given over to a field of silver grass. From the summit, visitors can see Udo Island, as well as take in the magnificent sunrise. The tuff cone area was designated as a natural reserve on July 19, 2000.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <BR>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-64-710-7923|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|First Monday of every month|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00<BR>* Hours subject to change|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Shop, pergola, etc.|\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 5,000 won / Teenagers & Children 2,500 won<br />Groups - Adults 4,000 won / Teenagers & Children 2,000 won<br />* Free admission: Senior citizens (ages 65 and older), preschoolers (ages 6 and younger)<BR> * Groups: 10 people or more<br />* Adults (ages 25-64), Teenagers (ages 13-24), Children (ages 7-12)|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Available in Chinese|\n  \n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-64-710-7923](tel:+82647107923)\n- [🏠www.jeju.go.kr](http://www.jeju.go.kr/jejuwnh/index.htm)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.4581111174\nlongitude: 126.9415156012\ntitle: 284-12, Ilchul-ro, Seogwipo-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\n From Jeju Intercity Bus Terminal, take a Direct Bus bound for Seongsan and get off at Seongsalliipgu Bus Stop. <br>\nWalk for approx. 1 km.\n","data":{"id":"2023-02-12-1676194558158","title":"Seongsan Ilchulbong Tuff Cone [UNESCO World Heritage] (성산일출봉 [유네스코 세계문화유산])","description":"Seongsan Ilchulbong Tuff Cone rose 180 meters above sea level due to a magma flow under the sea over 5,000 years ago.

Each hole is separated from the other holes by a few meters.<br><br> Legend has it that Samseonghyeol is the place where three demigods, the founding fathers of Tamna (the former name of Jeju), first appeared. They lived by hunting and gathering until&nbsp;they married three princesses from Byeokrangguk, whom came to shore in a wooden box. The three princesses brought with them a calf, pony, and five different seeds that eventually helped to establish agriculture in Jeju.<br><br> Curiously, the three holes are not percolated by rain or snow.  The ancient trees surrounding the holes look as if they are bowing to them, often surprising visitors.
