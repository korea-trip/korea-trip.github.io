Each hole is separated from the other holes by a few meters.<br><br> Legend has it that Samseonghyeol is the place where three demigods, the founding fathers of Tamna (the former name of Jeju), first appeared. They lived by hunting and gathering until&nbsp;they married three princesses from Byeokrangguk, whom came to shore in a wooden box. The three princesses brought with them a calf, pony, and five different seeds that eventually helped to establish agriculture in Jeju.<br><br> Curiously, the three holes are not percolated by rain or snow.  The ancient trees surrounding the holes look as if they are bowing to them, often surprising visitors. It takes just about 30 minutes to look around Samseonghyeol and its vicinity.","regDate":"2023-02-18","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-18-1676698598035/1618334_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-18-1676698598035"},{"id":"2023-02-18-1676695893214","title":"Saeseom Island Saeyeongyo Bridge (ÏÉàÏÑ¨ ÏÉàÏó∞Íµê)","description":"Saeyeongyo Bridge is the longest pedestrian overpass created in the southern-most area of the country.
