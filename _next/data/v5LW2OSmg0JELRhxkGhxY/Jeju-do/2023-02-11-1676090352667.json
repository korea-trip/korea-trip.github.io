{"pageProps":{"content":"![Sanbangsan Mountain (산방산)](/2023-02-11-1676090352667/2648186_image2_1.webp)\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> Sanbangsan Mountain is the result of violent volcanic activity some 700,000 to 800,000 years ago and is in fact a huge body of lava. The cliffs on the southern side of the lava dome are marked with a rich variety of curious formations such as weathering pits and talus scree slopes, some of which are as high as 200 meters. As its name ‘sanbang’ – literally meaning ‘a cave inside a mountain’ – suggests, this mountain contains a cave, which is located about 150 meters above sea level and has a spectacular view out over the ocean. Due to its close location to the sea and its high elevation, the peak is often ringed with clouds. The upper slopes of the mountain have their own distinct climatic conditions and are protected for their value for botanical research. <br><br>The Sanbangsa Temple and  Bomunsa Temple, which holds the relics of Buddha, are both located on the mountain. Walk along the stone-steps between the two temples and you will find the Sanbanggulsa Grotto. A signal beacon called ‘Yeondae’ in Korean stands at the roadside in front of the mountain, which, in the past, used to fire and smoke to relay urgent messages. Regarding function, it is similar to the more well-known ‘Bongsudae’ signal beacons; but ‘Yeondae’ beacons were built around hilly or coastal areas while ‘Bongsudae’ beacons were built on mountain tops. During the daytime, smoke was used to send warning signals, while fire was used at night. <br><br>*x_height above sea level  395.2m/ x_height above ground-level  345m/ Circumference  3,780m / Area  988,332㎡/ Diameter 1,314m\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-64-794-2940|\n|parking:|Available (Public parking lot (free) / Paid parking lot)|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)<br>* Subject to change depending on the weather conditions|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-02-11-1676090352667/191911_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-11-1676090352667/191911_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-11-1676090352667/2648187_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-11-1676090352667/2648187_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-64-794-2940](tel:+82647942940)\n- [🏠www.visitjeju.net](http://www.visitjeju.net/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.2362672397\nlongitude: 126.3115002498\ntitle: 218-10, Sanbang-ro, Seogwipo-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>\nTake Bus No. 202 or 251 and get off at Sanbangsan Mountain Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2023-02-11-1676090352667","title":"Sanbangsan Mountain (산방산)","description":"Sanbangsan Mountain is the result of violent volcanic activity some 700,000 to 800,000 years ago and is in fact a huge body of lava.

The word “Samseonghyeol” means “three clans holes”, referring to the three 品 shaped holes in the middle of the forest. Each hole is separated from the other holes by a few meters.<br><br> Legend has it that Samseonghyeol is the place where three demigods, the founding fathers of Tamna (the former name of Jeju), first appeared. They lived by hunting and gathering until&nbsp;they married three princesses from Byeokrangguk, whom came to shore in a wooden box. The three princesses brought with them a calf, pony, and five different seeds that eventually helped to establish agriculture in Jeju.<br><br> Curiously, the three holes are not percolated by rain or snow.  The ancient trees surrounding the holes look as if they are bowing to them, often surprising visitors. It takes just about 30 minutes to look around Samseonghyeol and its vicinity.","regDate":"2023-02-18","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-18-1676698598035/1618334_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-18-1676698598035"},{"id":"2023-02-18-1676695893214","title":"Saeseom Island Saeyeongyo Bridge (새섬 새연교)","description":"Saeyeongyo Bridge is the longest pedestrian overpass created in the southern-most area of the country.
