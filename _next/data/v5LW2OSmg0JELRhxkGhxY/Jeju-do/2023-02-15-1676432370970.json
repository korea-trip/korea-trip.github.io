This area is made of sandstone stacks, built up over millions of years. There are coastal caves here which are depressed into the shape of rooms, and wide rocks stacking up on one another along the seashore cliffs which create a majestic scenery by the sea.  Along the road down to the seashore, there is the Hamel Castaway Memorial, in remembrance of Hamel who drifted to this place in 1653. The coastal walking path is a popular date course, and haenyeo (female sea-divers) often sell freshly caught sea cucumbers and other seafood in the area.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-64-794-2940|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|09:00-19:00 (Last ticketing 18:00)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|[Sanbangsan Mountain & Yongmeori Beach Combined Ticket] <br>Individuals: Adults 2,500 won / Children 1,500 won<br>Groups: Adults 2,000 won / Children 1,000 won<br><br>[Yongmeori Beach]<br>Individuals: Adults 2,000 won / Children 1,000 won<br>Groups: Adults 1,600 won / Children 600 won<br><br>* Adults (ages 13 and older) / Children (ages 7-12)|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Public parking lot - free<br />Private parking lot - paid|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-02-15-1676432370970/286952_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-15-1676432370970/286952_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-15-1676432370970/286954_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-15-1676432370970/286954_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-15-1676432370970/286956_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-15-1676432370970/286956_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-15-1676432370970/286965_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-15-1676432370970/286965_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-15-1676432370970/492111_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-15-1676432370970/492111_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-15-1676432370970/2369545_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-15-1676432370970/2369545_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-15-1676432370970/2370831_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-15-1676432370970/2370831_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-64-794-2940](tel:+82647942940)\n- [🏠www.visitjeju.net](https://www.visitjeju.net/kr/detail/view?contentsid=CONT_000000000500471)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.2322593962\nlongitude: 126.3145222990\ntitle: 218-10, Sanbang-ro, Seogwipo-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2023-02-15-1676432370970","title":"Yongmeori Beach (용머리해안)","description":"Yongmeori Beach is where Sanbangsan Mountain stretches into the ocean and it looks as if a dragon’s head is going underwater.

Each hole is separated from the other holes by a few meters.<br><br> Legend has it that Samseonghyeol is the place where three demigods, the founding fathers of Tamna (the former name of Jeju), first appeared. They lived by hunting and gathering until&nbsp;they married three princesses from Byeokrangguk, whom came to shore in a wooden box. The three princesses brought with them a calf, pony, and five different seeds that eventually helped to establish agriculture in Jeju.<br><br> Curiously, the three holes are not percolated by rain or snow.  The ancient trees surrounding the holes look as if they are bowing to them, often surprising visitors.
