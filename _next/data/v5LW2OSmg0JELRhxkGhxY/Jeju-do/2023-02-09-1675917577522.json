The park as a whole looks like a piece of land art.<br><br>Jeju Loveland is open every day and it usually takes 30-40 minutes to look around the park. Jeju Loveland houses a glass-dome restaurant, an outdoor café, an art shop, and various works which visitors can touch. Jeju Loveland is an attractive place where eroticism is approached in an artistic and witty manner.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-64-712-6988|\n|parking:|Available (120 parking spaces)|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|09:00-22:00 (Last ticketing: 21:30)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Adults  12,000 won / Group 11,000 won<br>Senior citizens (age 65 or older) 10,000 won / Group 9,000 won<br> * Group: 30 people or more <BR>* No minors permitted (rest area available)|\n|Available Facilities:|Baengnok art gallery 1 & 2, guest house, gallery cafe, multipurpose theater, children rest area|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-02-09-1675917577522/1618530_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-09-1675917577522/1618530_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-09-1675917577522/1618531_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-09-1675917577522/1618531_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-09-1675917577522/1618532_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-09-1675917577522/1618532_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-09-1675917577522/1618533_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-09-1675917577522/1618533_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-09-1675917577522/1618535_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-09-1675917577522/1618535_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-09-1675917577522/1618536_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-09-1675917577522/1618536_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-64-712-6988](tel:+82647126988)\n- [🏠www.jejuloveland.com](http://www.jejuloveland.com)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.4521072871\nlongitude: 126.4883911640\ntitle: 2894-72, 1100-ro, Jeju-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2023-02-09-1675917577522","title":"Jeju Loveland (제주러브랜드)","description":"Jeju Loveland is a sculpture theme park based on sensuality and eroticism.

Each hole is separated from the other holes by a few meters.<br><br> Legend has it that Samseonghyeol is the place where three demigods, the founding fathers of Tamna (the former name of Jeju), first appeared. They lived by hunting and gathering until&nbsp;they married three princesses from Byeokrangguk, whom came to shore in a wooden box. The three princesses brought with them a calf, pony, and five different seeds that eventually helped to establish agriculture in Jeju.<br><br> Curiously, the three holes are not percolated by rain or snow.  The ancient trees surrounding the holes look as if they are bowing to them, often surprising visitors. It takes just about 30 minutes to look around Samseonghyeol and its vicinity.","regDate":"2023-02-18","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-18-1676698598035/1618334_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-18-1676698598035"},{"id":"2023-02-18-1676695893214","title":"Saeseom Island Saeyeongyo Bridge (새섬 새연교)","description":"Saeyeongyo Bridge is the longest pedestrian overpass created in the southern-most area of the country.
