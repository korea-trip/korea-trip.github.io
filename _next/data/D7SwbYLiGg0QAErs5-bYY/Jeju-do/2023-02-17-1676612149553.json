In May 2004, it was designated a site for protection as a hot springs source (Jeju Notice No. 2004-12). The hot springs opened in 2005 with Gumyeongsu, a hot springs public bath, spanning 11,111 square meters, housed in a 3,300-square-meter building with an estimated 1,000-person capacity. Sanggoji is the on-site restaurant, and means rainbow in the local dialect. Carbon hot springs are known to have health benefits for the heart, as carbonic acid gas is absorbed in the skin, stimulating capillary vessels and expanding blood vessels. This enhances blood circulation, lowering blood pressure and reducing the burden on the heart.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-64-792-8300|\n|opendate:|March 5, 2005|\n|parking:|Availabe (500 parking spaces)|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|[Indoor hot springs] 06:00-22:00<br>[Jjimjilbang, Korean sauna] 06:00-21:00<br>[Open-air bath (Swimming pool)] 11:00-21:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Facility Utilization Fees:|Open-air bath: 3,000 won<br>Jjimjilbang: 2,000 won<br>Swimsuit rental: 2,000 won|\n|Available Facilities:|Sauna, Jjimjilbang, Open-air bath, Guestroom, Restaurant, Sleeping room, Resting area, Swimming pool, Guest house, Massage room, Cafe|\n|Admission Fees:|Adults 12,000 won / Children 5,000 won <BR>* Children (ages 2 to elementary school students)|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-02-17-1676612149553/1620176_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-17-1676612149553/1620176_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-17-1676612149553/1620177_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-17-1676612149553/1620177_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-17-1676612149553/1620178_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-17-1676612149553/1620178_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-17-1676612149553/1620179_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-17-1676612149553/1620179_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-64-792-8300](tel:+82647928300)\n- [🏠tansanhot.com](http://tansanhot.com/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.2489628616\nlongitude: 126.2988482889\ntitle: 192, Sagyebuk-ro 41beon-gil, Seogwipo-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>\nFrom Seogwipo Intercity Bus Terminal, take an intercity bus to \nthe Western Coast Line bound for Seogwi, Daejeong, Gosan and get off at Deoksu Elementary School Bus Stop.<br>\nWalk for approx. 7 min. from the bus stop. <br><br>\nOr, take Bus No. 37 or 500 from Jeju International Airport and get off at Deoksu-ri Bus Stop. <br>\nWalk for approx. 678m to the venue.\n","data":{"id":"2023-02-17-1676612149553","title":"Jeju Sanbangsan Carbonate Hot Springs (제주 산방산탄산온천)","description":"Jeju Sanbangsan Carbonate Hot Springs is a rare carbon hot spring, and the first public hot spring in Jeju.

Each hole is separated from the other holes by a few meters.<br><br> Legend has it that Samseonghyeol is the place where three demigods, the founding fathers of Tamna (the former name of Jeju), first appeared. They lived by hunting and gathering until&nbsp;they married three princesses from Byeokrangguk, whom came to shore in a wooden box. The three princesses brought with them a calf, pony, and five different seeds that eventually helped to establish agriculture in Jeju.<br><br> Curiously, the three holes are not percolated by rain or snow.  The ancient trees surrounding the holes look as if they are bowing to them, often surprising visitors.
