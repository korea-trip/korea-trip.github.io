The king and queen are enshrined separately. The tomb on the left is King Sejo‚Äôs and the one on the right is Queen Jeonhui‚Äôs with a pavilion standing between the two tombs. Requested by King Sejo on his will, the simple design of the tomb and the surrounding compare to the past tombs saved cost and manpower required to finish the work, which became the model for future royal tomb design. Gwangneung is surrounded by forests where an abundance of wild plants grow. It is famous for being the habitat of the Korean redheaded woodpecker (Natural Monument No. 11).\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-31-527-7105|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|Mondays|\n|usetime:|November-January 09:00-17:30<BR>February-May, September-October 09:00-18:00<br>June-August 09:00-18:30<br>* Last admission is 1 hour before closing.|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Gwangneung Historical Museum, mineral spring, drinking fountain, benches, etc.|\n|Admission Fees:|[General admission]<br /> Individuals: Adults 1,000 won / Children & Teenagers 500 won<br /> Groups: Adults 800 won / Children & Teenagers 400 won<br /> <br />  * Groups: 10 or more people <br />* Adults (ages 19-64) / Children & Teenagers (ages 7-18) <br />* Free admission: Preschoolers (ages 6 & under) and senior citizens (ages 65 & over)<br />* ID must be presented at the ticket box. <br /> <br />[Other passes]<br />Hourly pass: 30,000 won<br />* Viewing hours 12:00-13:00 <br />* Valid for 1 year <br /><br />Lunch pass: 3,000 won<br />* Viewing hours12:00-14:00 (last admission is at 13:00)<br />* Limited to 10 times <br /><br />Monthly pass: 10,000 won<br /> * Visitors may enter freely within operating hours<br />* Valid for 1 month<br /><br /> [Free entry]<br /> * All visitors on the last Wednesday of each month (Culture Day). <br /> * Visitors wearing hanbok.|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Unavailable|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-25-1661417236103/2364478_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-25-1661417236103/2364478_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-25-1661417236103/2364480_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-25-1661417236103/2364480_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-25-1661417236103/2364481_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-25-1661417236103/2364481_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-31-527-7105](tel:+82315277105)\n- [üè†royaltombs.cha.go.kr](http://royaltombs.cha.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.7528333807\nlongitude: 127.1767420667\ntitle: 354, Gwangneungsumogwon-ro, Namyangju-si, Gyeonggi-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nCheongnyangni Station (Seoul Subway Line 1), Exit 4. <br>\nTake Bus No. 707 and get off at Gwangneungnae Terminal Bus Stop.<br> Transfer to Bus No. 21 and get off at Gwangneung Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-25-1661417236103","title":"Gwangneung Royal Tomb [UNESCO World Heritage] (ÎÇ®ÏñëÏ£º Í¥ëÎ¶â(ÏÑ∏Ï°∞, Ï†ïÌù¨ÏôïÌõÑ) [Ïú†ÎÑ§Ïä§ÏΩî ÏÑ∏Í≥ÑÎ¨∏ÌôîÏú†ÏÇ∞])","description":"Gwangneung, located in Namyangju in Gyeonggi-do is the royal tomb of King Sejo (1417-1468, reign 1455-1468) and Queen Jeonghui (1418-1483).
