Before reaching the valley, the water joins the currents from Sinbatgol, Jogaegol, and Bambatgol Valleys. The volume of water increases as it passes Saejae and Oegok Village and reaches Yupyeong-ri where Daewonsa Temple is located. The incessant sound of running water fills the silence of the forest as if Buddhist nuns were chanting blessings.","regDate":"2022-07-30","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Valleys"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-30-1659206633447/2671386_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-07-30-1659206633447"},{"id":"2022-07-30-1659202733749","title":"Chungnyeolsa Shrine (Ï∂©Î†¨ÏÇ¨)","description":"Chungnyeolsa Shrine was built in 1606 upon the order of King Seonjo to commemorate Admiral Yi Sun-sin's loyalty and brilliant exploits.

Chokseongnu (historically known as ‚ÄòJangwollu‚Äô) has undergone eight renovations since its establishment in the 28th year of King Gojong (1241, Goryeo dynasty) and was once used as a commanding post for defending Jinju Palace in times of war. During times of peace, it was used for holding state examinations. <br><br>Although the structure was burnt down during the Korean War, it was restored in 1960 through the efforts of the Jinju Historical Site Preservation Society. The roof design features a mix of hipped and gabled styles and the stone pillars were built with rocks collected from Chokseoksan Mountain, located in Changwon-si. The wood used for the structure was brought from Odaesan Mountain, situated in Gangwon-do. Noticeable features of Chokseongnu are the four engraved signboards and a board that holds the works of renowned poets and calligraphers. Jinju Namgang Yudeung (Lantern) Festival is held every fall at the Jinjuseong Fortress.","regDate":"2022-07-30","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-30-1659199947652/2367499_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangnam-do/2022-07-30-1659199947652"},{"id":"2022-07-30-1659191859787","title":"Changwon Garosu-gil (Ï∞ΩÏõê Í∞ÄÎ°úÏàòÍ∏∏)","description":"Like Seoul, the city of Changwon also has a romantic promenade called \"Garosu-gil,\" lined with metasequoia trees on each side.
