Furthermore, every valley is decorated with an exquisite rock face and lush forest adding to the mountains reputation. Palgongsan Mountain was designated as a provincial park in May 1980. The mountain has many ancient temples and historical sites such as the Gatbawi Stone Buddha, Wonhyosa Temple, Cheonseongsa Temple and Bulgulsa Temple.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-54-880-8300|\n|restdate:|* Subject to closure due to adverse weather conditions.|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Hiking Course:|Palgongsan Mountain main course: 27.2 kilometers, 14 hours<br>Eunhaesa Temple Course 1: 15.4 kilometers, 8 hours<br>Gatbawi Course 1: 11.5 kilometers, 6 hours<br>Gatbawi Course 2-1: 2.1 kilometers, 1 hour 10 min<br>Gatbawi Course 2-1: 2 kilometers, 1 hour<br>Chisangyegok Course 1: 8.5 kilometers, 6 hours<br>Gasansanseong Course 1: 4.7 kilometers, 2 hour 10 min|\n|Areas Open to the Public:|Gyeongsan-si to Chilgok-gun: Gwanbong - Seonbonjae - Neupaejae - Domajae - Yeombulbong Peak - Dongbong Peak - Birobong Peak - Gasanbawibong Peak - Mulbulsan - Hantijae - Chikibong Peak - Gasanbong Peak - Gasanbawi Rock<br>Chilgok-gun: Jinnammun Gate - Cheonjusateo - Yongbawi Rock<br>Yeongcheon-si: Sudosa Temple- Gongsanpokpo Falls - Jinbulam - Dongbong Peak, Baekheungam - Jungangam - Neupaejae<br>Gyeonsan-si: Seonbosa Temple - Yaksaam - Yongdeoksa Temple- Gwanbong Peak|\n|Mountain Not Access Period:|Seasonal Forest Fire Prevention Period<br>Spring: March 2 - April 30 <br>Autumn: November 1 - December 15<br>* Subject to change based on weather advisories, snow/precipitation levels, and other local conditions.|\n|Restricted Mountain Areas :|Chilgok-gun: Witsandang - Gasansanseong Fortress, Morajae - Gasanbawi Rock, Hakmyeong-dong (Dumusil) - Gasansanseong Fortress (Namporu), Yeorijae - Namporu - East Gate<br>Yeongcheon-si: Sudosa Temple- Palgongpokpo Falls - Domajae<br> Gyeongsan-si: Peokjeong (Gatbawi parking lot) - Neupaejae|\n|Tour Course Information:|Tour Course (1 day)<br>1.
