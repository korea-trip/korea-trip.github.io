One day, the maid took her husband‚Äôs boat out to sea to harvest seaweed. Her husband dropped her off at a site  that was at a distance from the beach. After promising to pick her up later, he returned to the beach to do his work. However, the weather turned bad as strong winds and pummeing waves begun. The husband failed to rescue his wife on time and she ultimately drowned. Since then, the villagers were unable to catch any fishes and some claimed that it wasbecause of the dead maid.
