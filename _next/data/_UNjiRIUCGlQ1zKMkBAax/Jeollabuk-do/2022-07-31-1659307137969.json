The origin of the name \"Gaeam\" goes back to 282 BC, when King Mun from the Byeonhan confederacy took refuge here during the revolt of the Jinhan and Mahan confederacies. Under King Mun's command, temples for the new fortress were built on east and west sides of the valley; the western temple was called Gaeam. In 676, the temple was expanded and in 1276, thirty more buildings were raised, expanding it to a grand temple.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|accomcount:|No limit|\n|expagerange:|Open to visitors age 5 & over|\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<BR> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-63-581-0080|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604186_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604186_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604187_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604187_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604188_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604188_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604189_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604189_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604190_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604190_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604191_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604191_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604192_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604192_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604306_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604306_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604307_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604307_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604308_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659307137969/1604308_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-63-581-0080](tel:+82635810080)\n- [üè†www.gaeamsa.org</a><br /><a href=\"http://gaeamsa.templestay.com\" target=\"_blank\">gaeamsa.templestay.com](http://www.gaeamsa.org)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.6628507594\nlongitude: 126.6498267208\ntitle: 248, Gaeam-ro, Buan-gun, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-31-1659307137969","title":"Gaeamsa Temple (Í∞úÏïîÏÇ¨)","description":"Gaeamsa Temple is a small, quiet temple built in 634 during the Baekje dynasty.

The temple was destroyed at one point in time, but Master Monk Jinul prayed that it be rebuilt. In accordance with his fervent hopes, in the 1600s the monk‚Äôs followers rebuilt a number of the temple‚Äôs halls and buildings, many of which can still be seen today.
