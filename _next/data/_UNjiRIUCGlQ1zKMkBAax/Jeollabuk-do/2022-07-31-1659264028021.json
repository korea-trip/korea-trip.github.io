The name Chaeseokgang was adapted as it resembles an attraction of the same name in China. Chaeseokgang Cliff was formed from many layers of rocks stratified by the sea, and the blue sea and the rock cliffs together create quite a lovely picture. It is nature’s masterpiece of stratification, and visitors can observe interesting structures and shapes that cannot be seen elsewhere.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|expagerange:|Open to visitors of all ages|\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-63-580-4331|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Sunrise-Sunset|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Tour Course Information:|* Nearby attractions: Jeokbyeokgang Cliff - Chaeseokgang Cliff - Film Theme Park - Jeolla Jwasu Filming Set - Nue Town<br />* Masil-gil Course 3|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Parking Fees:|Accommodations, pavilion, cafe, drinking fountain, visitors information center|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Geopark guide available<br />* Reservation required<br>* Inquiries: +82-63-581-5114, +82-63-584-2114|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-31-1659264028021/252454_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659264028021/252454_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659264028021/252455_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659264028021/252455_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659264028021/252456_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659264028021/252456_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659264028021/252457_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659264028021/252457_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659264028021/252458_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659264028021/252458_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659264028021/252459_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659264028021/252459_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659264028021/689387_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659264028021/689387_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659264028021/689389_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659264028021/689389_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659264028021/689390_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659264028021/689390_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659264028021/689392_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659264028021/689392_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-63-580-4331](tel:+82635804331)\n- [🏠www.jbgeopark.kr](http://www.jbgeopark.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.6279822530\nlongitude: 126.4700297445\ntitle: Gyeokpo-ri, Buan-gun, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Express/Intercity Bus]<br>\nFrom Dong Seoul Bus Terminal or Seoul Central City Bus Terminal, take a bus to Buan Bus Terminal.<br>\nFrom Buan Terminal, take a bus to Gyeokpo Terminal.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-31-1659264028021","title":"Chaeseokgang Cliff (Jeonbuk National Geopark) (채석강 (전북 서해안권 국가지질공원))","description":"Chaeseokgang Cliff refers to a rocky cliff and the sea around it near the Gyeokpohang Port and Dagibong areas on Byeonsanbando Peninsula.

For many years the temple lay incomplete until Monk Bojo Chejing began reconstruction in the 7th year of King Gyeongmun of Silla (AD 867). The temple was destroyed at one point in time, but Master Monk Jinul prayed that it be rebuilt. In accordance with his fervent hopes, in the 1600s the monk’s followers rebuilt a number of the temple’s halls and buildings, many of which can still be seen today. The temple is also remembered as the temple that King Injo helped rebuild with the hope that his two sons, who had been taken hostage by the Qing dynasty during the Byeongjahoran War (Chinese invasion of Korea in 1636), would be returned safely and that Buddha would heal the nation.<br><br> One of the Korea’s four major temples, Songgwangsa is home to Jijangbosal and Siwangsang statues (found in Jijangjeon Hall), a Seokgayeorae statue, and 500 Nahansang statues (found in Nahanjeon Hall). The temple is also home to eight Tangible Cultural Assets and four Treasured Cultural Assets  Daeungjeon Hall, the Samsebulsang statues, the bell-tower, and the Sacheonwangsang statue.<br><br>Beloved for its historical significance as well as its beauty, the temple draws throngs of worshipers throughout the year.

A worthwhile attraction for visitors of all ages, the temple is particularly well-suited for those with mobility problems since it is located on ground level.","regDate":"2023-01-10","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-10-1673343382073/215448_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-10-1673343382073"},{"id":"2023-01-10-1673339945737","title":"Wanggung Five-story Stone Pagoda (익산 왕궁리 오층석탑)","description":"The Wanggung Five-story Stone Pagoda is located on a hill about 2 kilometers south of Wanggung-myeon in Iksan, which is believed to have been the capital of the nation during the Mahan Era.
