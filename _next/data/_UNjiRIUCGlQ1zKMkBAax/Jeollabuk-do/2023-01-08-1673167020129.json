The tunnel is approximately 3 meters in x_height and 10 meters in length, and divides the villages of Sindu Maeul into Dugil-ri, Seolcheon-myeon and Inam Maeul in Socheon-ri. During the Three Kingdoms Period, the rocky ridges of Seokgyeonsan Mountain drew the boundary of Sillas Mupung in the east with Baekjes Seolcheo to the west. <br>Tracing the history from the Three Kingdoms Period to the Goryeo dynasty, the cultures and traditions of the two regions were markedly different. If curious about the difference, one could simply stop by Seolcheon on market day, where the Muju and Mupung local dialects and customs can easily be distinguished. <br><br>People used to cross Seokgyeonsan Mountain by a footpath along the rocky ridge to travel between Seolcheon and Mupung. During the Japanese occupation, a new road was created by turning a cave into a tunnel through the mountain so cows and horse carts could freely pass from Muju to Gimcheon. <br><br>General Kim Yoo Shin from the Silla Kingdom, the hero of unification of the Three Kingdoms, often passed by the gate, later giving rise to the gates nickname, Tongilmun (literally Unification Gate). The gate is number one on the list of 33 scenic sites in Gucheon-dong.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-63-322-2905|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-08-1673167020129/711236_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-08-1673167020129/711236_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-08-1673167020129/1246777_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-08-1673167020129/1246777_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-08-1673167020129/1246782_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-08-1673167020129/1246782_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-08-1673167020129/1246807_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-08-1673167020129/1246807_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-08-1673167020129/1929666_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-08-1673167020129/1929666_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-08-1673167020129/2366377_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-08-1673167020129/2366377_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-08-1673167020129/2366379_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-08-1673167020129/2366379_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-63-322-2905](tel:+82633222905)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.9956856242\nlongitude: 127.7952077662\ntitle: Rajetongmun-ro, Muju-gun, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Seoul Nambu Bus Terminal, take a bus to Gucheon-dong Bus Stop. <br>\nWalk for approx. 135m to Seolcheon Gucheon-dong Stop and take a local bus to Seolcheon and get off at Sindu Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-08-1673167020129","title":"Rajetongmun Gate (라제통문)","description":"The historical border of the Silla and Baekje Kingdoms, Rajetongmun Gate of Seolcheon-myeon, Muju was formed from a rock cave in Seokgyeonsan Mountain.

For many years the temple lay incomplete until Monk Bojo Chejing began reconstruction in the 7th year of King Gyeongmun of Silla (AD 867). The temple was destroyed at one point in time, but Master Monk Jinul prayed that it be rebuilt. In accordance with his fervent hopes, in the 1600s the monk’s followers rebuilt a number of the temple’s halls and buildings, many of which can still be seen today. The temple is also remembered as the temple that King Injo helped rebuild with the hope that his two sons, who had been taken hostage by the Qing dynasty during the Byeongjahoran War (Chinese invasion of Korea in 1636), would be returned safely and that Buddha would heal the nation.<br><br> One of the Korea’s four major temples, Songgwangsa is home to Jijangbosal and Siwangsang statues (found in Jijangjeon Hall), a Seokgayeorae statue, and 500 Nahansang statues (found in Nahanjeon Hall). The temple is also home to eight Tangible Cultural Assets and four Treasured Cultural Assets  Daeungjeon Hall, the Samsebulsang statues, the bell-tower, and the Sacheonwangsang statue.<br><br>Beloved for its historical significance as well as its beauty, the temple draws throngs of worshipers throughout the year.

A worthwhile attraction for visitors of all ages, the temple is particularly well-suited for those with mobility problems since it is located on ground level.","regDate":"2023-01-10","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-10-1673343382073/215448_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-10-1673343382073"},{"id":"2023-01-10-1673339945737","title":"Wanggung Five-story Stone Pagoda (익산 왕궁리 오층석탑)","description":"The Wanggung Five-story Stone Pagoda is located on a hill about 2 kilometers south of Wanggung-myeon in Iksan, which is believed to have been the capital of the nation during the Mahan Era.
