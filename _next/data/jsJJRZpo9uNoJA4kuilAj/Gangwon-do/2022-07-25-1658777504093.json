However, it is now known that the temple was built after King Sukjong, the 19th King of the Joseon dynasty (1392-1910), who reigned from 1674 to 1720, because of the architectural style of Daeungjeon Hall. There is a legend that the Guryongsa Temple site was originally a lake where nine dragons lived. The name Guryong comes from the story that the lake was filled up to build the temple on it. There are many buildings such as Daeungjeon Hall, Bogwangnu Pavilion, Samseonggak Pavilion, Simgeomdang Hall and Seolseondang Hall. Daeungjeon Hall has maintained its original shape though it was repaired many times.","regDate":"2022-09-25","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-25-1664091631316/2391453_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-09-25-1664091631316"},{"id":"2022-09-25-1664088775156","title":"Gugokpokpo Falls (Íµ¨Í≥°Ìè≠Ìè¨)","description":"Located at the foot of Bonghwasan Mountain in Chuncheon, Gugok Falls with a x_height of 50 m is one of the representative tourist destinations in the Gangchon area.

Many tourists visit the falls every year to enjoy cool, refreshing water to overcome the heat wave in summer and to admire a majestic view of the giant ice wall in winter. The road from the ticket booth to the falls is gentle and requires about 20 min walk. It is an easy walking path surrounded by woods and the valley. Visitors can also try to find the nine wooden panels inspired by the spirit of Gugok and designed with Hangeul alphabet ‚Äú„Ñ≤‚Äù letters (such as Íøà, ÎÅº, ÍæÄ, Íπ°, etc.). If you go up for about 40 min along the Kkalttak Pass, which is on the right side of the Gugok Falls entrance, you will find Munbae Village, nestled in a basin.

The crystal clear waters of the Hantangang River wind around Goseokbawi Rock, a peculiarly shaped rock of about 10 meters tall that stands dominantly in the middle of the river. Goseokjeong Pavilion is a two-story tower-style pavilion that has an area of about 33 square meters, built halfway up the Hantangang River during the reign of King Jinpyeong (r. AD 579-632) of the Silla Kingdom. Today, Goseokjeong refers to the entire area around Goseokjeong Pavilion and the valley surrounding Goseok Rock. Designated as a Monument of Gangwon-do, the pavilion is known to have been one of the most favored places by King Jinpyeong of Silla Kingdom, and King Chungsuk of Goryeo dynasty. The area became all the more famous as the arena of Im Kkeok-jeong (?-1562), who was a legendary leader of a peasant rebellion in the early Joseon dynasty. <br><br>The pavilion was destroyed during the Korean War and restored in 1971 by community leaders in Cheorwon. Unfortunately, it was damaged once again by flood in 1996 and reconstructed the year after. There is a natural stone chamber inside Goseokbawi Rock that Im Kkeok-jeong used as a hiding place. On the opposite side, there are remains of a stone castle. Jiktang Waterfall is located about 2 kilometers up from this site, while Sundam Valley is situated about 2 kilometers in the downstream. Goseokjeong is a year-round tourist attraction with an extensive grass square and recreational facilities. It is also the starting point for DMZ tours as the Iron Triangle Battlefield Conservation Office is located here and in winter, visitors can enjoy migratory bird tour.","regDate":"2022-09-24","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Tourist Complexes"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-24-1664012586092/2567099_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-09-24-1664012586092"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
