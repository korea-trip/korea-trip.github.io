Although the exact date of construction is uncertain, it is estimated that the building was built around the same time as Daejeonghyeon in 1416.<br>\n <br> The school was originally located inside Bukseong but it was once moved outside of Dongmun and then again to the site of Seoseong. It was finally moved to Dansan Oreum where it remains to this day. At present, Daejeonghyanggyo Confucian School  consists of Daeseongjeon, Myeongryundang, Dongjae, Seojae Shinsammun, Daeseongmun, Dongmalmun and Dongjeongmun. Daeseongjeon was remodeled in 1669, 1688, and 1752. Myeongryundang was rebuilt in 1772. After several instances of remodeling and rebuilding, Daeseongjeon was remodeled again in 1993.

At the base of this cliff is the Jisatgae Coast along with the imposing stone pillars. Jusangjeolli are stone pillars piled up along the coast and is a designated cultural monument of Jeju Island. Jusangjeolli Cliff was formed when the lava from Hallasan Mountain erupted into the sea of Jungmun. They are rock pillars shaped like cubes or hexagons of various sizes and almost seem as if stone masons had carved them out. The administration of the district named them 'Jisatgae Rocks' from their old name 'Jisatgae'. The 20m cliff makes it a popular spot for high tide and sea angling. The waves of the high tide crashing into the side of the cliff provide a breathtaking view of the ocean surrounding the pillars.","regDate":"2022-07-19","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-19-1658238893407/197693_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2022-07-19-1658238893407"},{"id":"2022-07-19-1658230401587","title":"Cheonjiyeonpokpo Falls [UNESCO Global Geopark] (Ï≤úÏßÄÏó∞Ìè≠Ìè¨ (Ï†úÏ£ºÎèÑ Íµ≠Í∞ÄÏßÄÏßàÍ≥µÏõê))","description":"The water of Cheonjiyeonpokpo Falls appears to fall from the heavens, giving it its name, meaning \"sky connected with land.\" The wooded area around the falls is home to the wild dampalsu trees, designated as Natural Monument No. 163, as well as a great variety of rare plants such as brambles, and songyeopnan as well as gusiljappam trees, sanyuja trees (Chinese lemon trees), and camellias.
