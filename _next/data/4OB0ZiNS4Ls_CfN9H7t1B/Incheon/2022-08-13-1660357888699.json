After  a little street started specializing in serving&nbsp;baendaengi some 30 years ago,  the fish&nbsp;has continued to grow in popularity. <br> <br> Located in Guwol-dong, across from the Incheon Culture & Arts Center, Baendaengi  Street has expanded, and so has the variety of dishes served. Visitors can try baendaengi prepared sashimi-style,   roasted, or  in a spicy soup. For this particular species of herring, locals believe the flavor is best in March and April when they grow to their largest size. Salted Baendaengi also makes an excellent side-dish for Korean meals. <br> <br>* Baendaengi is one of many types of small prey fish referred to as ‘Soeo’ for their fierce struggle in fishing nets. Soeo have internal organs that are proportionally smaller than other species of fish and are known for their feisty nature.  These attributes are thought to signify a stress-filled life,  which  is why many Koreans refer to narrow-minded or hot-tempered people as ‘baendaengi.’","regDate":"2022-08-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Culture/Art/History","Experience Programs","Cultural Districts"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-08-13-1660395563205"},{"id":"2022-08-13-1660390528798","title":"Hanagae Beach (하나개해수욕장)","description":"Hanagae Beach, the biggest tideland on Muuido Island, features a one-kilometer-long beach covered by fine, powder-like sands. Unique bungalows on the shore become floating houses when the tide comes in. When the tide goes out, the beach expands into a vast stretch of tidal flats. A large number of clams, sea snails, and crabs dwell in these tidal flats, and can be dug out with bare hands. The beach also offers splendid views of the glowing red sunset, and is popular among tourists as the filming location of the TV drama Stairway to Heaven (2003).","regDate":"2022-08-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-08-13-1660390528798"},{"id":"2022-08-13-1660387217022","title":"Ganghwa Seodo Central Church (강화 서도 중앙교회)","description":"By the late Joseon dynasty, Ganghwado Island had already been attacked many times by foreign invaders. During the Byeonginyangyo (the French invasion in 1866), the French fleet stayed in Ganghwado for about a month until they withdrew their forces after losing during the Jeongjoksanseong Battle. During the Sinmiyangyo (the United States expedition to Korea in 1981), the American fleet attacked Chojijin Fortress, Deokjinjin Fortress and Gwangseongbo Fortress. Hence, Ganghwado played a big part in South Korea opening its doors to the West in the 19th century. Ganghwado also became the Western Christian missionaries' center of activity for their missionary works.<br><br>There are three remaining churches that were built in that time that were  influenced or built by the Western Christian Missionaries  Ganghwa Anglican Church established in 1900, Ganghwa St. Andrew's Church established in 1906, and Ganghwa Seodo Central Church established in 1923. <br><br>Ganghwa Seodo Central Church started contruction in February 1923 and was completed as a Korean-architecture chapel in July 1923. The original name was Jumun Church and it was renamed as Seodo Central (Jungang) Church in 1978. The church belongs to The Korean Methodist Church.<br><br>Even though the building of the church doesn't reflect outstanding building techniques and aesthetic qualities, a Western church with a Korean-style wooden structure such as Ganghwa Seodo Central Church is still worth a visit.","regDate":"2022-08-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Holy Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-08-13-1660387217022"},{"id":"2022-08-13-1660368996299","title":"Ganghwa Gyodongdo Island (교동도(강화))","description":"Gyodongdo Island is located northwest of the larger Ganghwado Island, and was made more accessible with the opening of Gyodongdaegyo Bridge in July 2014. The name changed with different dynasties, being Gomokgeunhyeon during the Goguryeo Era and Gyodonghyeon under the reign of Silla King Gyeongdeok. The island served as an important stopover point for ambassadors and envoys heading to China. Popular attractions on the island now include Daeryong Market, an alleyway market decorated with colorful murals and statues, and Manghyangdae Memorial, a gathering place for refugees who fled from the nearby Hwanghaedo Island during the Korean War. Many of the houses on Gyodongdo Island have swallow nests under the eaves. The refugees consider the swallows as guests from their hometowns. As such, the island is home to the peace & reunion themed Gyodong Swallow House, Peace Trail, and Gyodong Studio. Gyodong Swallow House serves as an exhibition and performance space. The Peace Trail is a biking path around the island. At Gyodong Studio, visitors can put on old school uniforms and take black-and-white photographs.","regDate":"2022-08-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-13-1660368996299/1890654_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-08-13-1660368996299"},{"id":"2022-08-12-1660347497659","title":"Yongyudo Island (용유도)","description":"With 48.2 kilometers long coastline and a total area of 13.603 kilometer square, Yongyudo Island is located near other islands such as Sinbuldo Island, Sammokdo Island, Yeongjongdo Island, Daemuuido Island, Jangbongdo Island, Modo Island, Sido Island, and Sindo Island.

The chief of Ganghwa County, Jeong Gi-se, enlarged the original residence and named it Yongheunggung (meaning palace of the rising dragon) in the 4th year of King Cheoljong’s reign. Its architectural features include a paljak (traditional Korean half-hipped roof) and supporting columns  rendered in Jusimpo style, the column brackets  placed only on top of the columns. The palace was built in the tradition of dwelling houses such as the Yeongyeongdang and Nakseonjae houses in Changdeokgung Palace, so the palace buildings give off a simple and plain atmosphere. Within the precincts of the palace are a memorial stone and a monument house indicating that the palace used to be the old home of King Cheoljong.","regDate":"2022-08-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Old Houses"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-12-1660343994183/1575640_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-08-12-1660343994183","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Incheon/2022-08-12-1660343994183"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
