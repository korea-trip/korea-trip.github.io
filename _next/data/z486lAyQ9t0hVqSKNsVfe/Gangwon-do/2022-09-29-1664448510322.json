This unique formation and the ecosystem that came to live on the sand bar are highly valued. The water in the lagoon was a mix of fresh and salt water, creating a special environment for aquatic animals of both types to live together. The lake is in the shape of a figure eight, with the southern lake being larger than the northern lake, although the northern lake is still connected with the ocean through a small stream.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-33-249-3881|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Film Locations:|Drama \"Autumn in My Heart (2000)\"<br>Film \"Failan (2001)\"|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-09-29-1664448510322/1581490_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-29-1664448510322/1581490_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-29-1664448510322/1581492_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-29-1664448510322/1581492_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-29-1664448510322/1581493_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-29-1664448510322/1581493_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-29-1664448510322/1813110_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-29-1664448510322/1813110_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-29-1664448510322/1813113_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-29-1664448510322/1813113_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-29-1664448510322/1906630_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-29-1664448510322/1906630_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-33-249-3881](tel:+82332493881)\n- [🏠www.koreadmz.kr</a><br><a href=\"http://hwajinpobeach.co.kr/\" target=\"_blank\">hwajinpobeach.co.kr](http://www.koreadmz.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 38.4788446862\nlongitude: 128.4391216433\ntitle: Hyeonnae-myeon, Goseong-gun, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-09-29-1664448510322","title":"Hwajinpo Beach [National Geopark] (화진포 (강원평화지역 국가지질공원))","description":"Hwajinpo Lake is the largest lagoon in Korea, created by a section of the ocean being closed off when two opposing sand spits merged.
