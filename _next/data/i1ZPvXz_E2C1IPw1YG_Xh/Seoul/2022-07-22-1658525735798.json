Nevertheless, reconstruction efforts were started in 1711 (37th year of King Sukjong) and the gate was restored together with the gate's watchtower. Gwanghuimun Gate remained intact even when the fortress walls were demolished to build tram tracks during the Japanese occupation, but it was later damaged during the Korean War and left neglected. In 1975, restoration work was carried out to relocate Gwanghuimun Gate to a site 15 meters south of its original location since it stood in the middle of the road.","regDate":"2022-07-23","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Gates"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-23-1658575967064/1568502_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-07-23-1658575967064"},{"id":"2022-07-23-1658572742393","title":"Gwanaksan Mountain Nakseongdae Park (관악산 낙성대공원)","description":"Nakseongdae Park was built as a tribute to General Kang Gam-chan (948-1031) of the Goryeo dynasty.

The various rocky peaks and the deep valleys give the mountain a rugged feel. The mountain's size and close proximity to Seoul make it easy for Seoul residents to make a day-trip. <br> <br>In the spring, cherry blossoms are in full bloom near the entrance to the mountain, and a Rhododendron Festival is held when the rhododendrons are in full bloom. At the mountain's summit are Wongaksa Temple and Yeonjuam Hermitage, which were built by Taejo Yi Seong-gye (the founder of the Joseon dynasty) to ward off misfortune when he decided to move the capital to Seoul. There are also other temples and hermitages, and a ground radar observation post.

It is said that after retirement, Heo Jun came to Heogabawi Rock to compile the famous medical book Dongui Bogam. <br><br> A part of the Hangang River here was turned into a lake due to the construction of the Olympic Expressway and high-rise apartments surrounding the park. There is a statue of Heo Jun treating a patient and in the lake, there is a purple-colored rock with holes called Gwangju Rock. Before the construction of the Yanghwadaegyo Bridge, this area used to be where visitors would take a ferry (Gongam Ferry) to cross the other side. <br><br>Heogabawi Rock, which is wide enough to accommodate about 20 men, is said to be where people took refuge during wars. Gwangju Rock and Heogabawi Rock is the site of Jechapaeui (the rock where rituals were offered to the God of the Earth and the God of Crops during the Hanseong Baekje period). This was also the first historical name given to this area.","regDate":"2022-07-23","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-23-1658561652403/566492_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-07-23-1658561652403"},{"id":"2022-07-23-1658558608736","title":"Gold Spa (황금온천)","description":"Visitors can enjoy hot springs in the middle of the city at Gold Spa in Gangnam, Seoul.
