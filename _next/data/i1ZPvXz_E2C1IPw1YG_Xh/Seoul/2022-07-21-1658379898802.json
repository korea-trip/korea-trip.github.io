The Bukhansan National Park covers both Bukhansan and Dobongsan Mountains, and spans the total area of 80.699 „é¢. At the top of Bukhansan Mountain are Baegundae Terrace (835.6 m), Insubong Peak (810.5 m) and Mangyeongdae Terrace (799.5 m), which gave the mountain the nickname \"Samgaksan\" or the \"three-horned mountain.\" The mountain had other names: Sambongsan (mountain with three peaks), Hwasan (flower mountain), and Buaak (mountain shaped like a person giving a baby a piggyback ride). The current name, Bukhansan, was given after the Bukhansanseong Fortress was built under King Sukjong of the Joseon dynasty.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-2-909-0498|\n|parking:|Available (Bukhansanseong Parking Lots 1 & 2, Jeongneung Parking Lot)|\n|restdate:|* Subject to abrupt closure due to adverse weather conditions.|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Mountain Not Access Period:|Period of restricted access for fire-prevention and natural scenery maintenance, natural environment protection, and forest protection<br>[Hiking Trails]<br>Spring: March 2-April 30 / Fall: November 1-December 15<br>[National Park]<br>November 15-December 15 (Except Gyeongju & Taean shoreline)<br>* TBD by park directors based on fire weather advisories, precipitation levels, and other local conditions.

Gwanghuimun Gate remained intact even when the fortress walls were demolished to build tram tracks during the Japanese occupation, but it was later damaged during the Korean War and left neglected.
