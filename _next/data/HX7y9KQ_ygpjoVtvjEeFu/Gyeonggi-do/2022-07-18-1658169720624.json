Water jets located in the bade pool shoot out water, which massages various parts of the body and at the same time revitalizes the skin. In addition, you can walk, swim, or exercise in the water stream pool, which has a depth of 120 centimeters. <br><br>Icheon Termeden started as a hot spring spa, but it plans to expand further into a multi-resort complex, which will include hotel and condominium facilities, an arboretum, a golf driving range, and horseback riding.","regDate":"2022-09-09","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Hot Springs & Spa"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-09-1662706944231/2041309_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-09-09-1662706944231"},{"id":"2022-09-09-1662703678782","title":"Temporary Palace at Hwaseong Fortress (Hwaseong Haenggung Palace) (ÌôîÏÑ±ÌñâÍ∂Å)","description":"A <em>haenggung</em> is a temporary palace where the king and royal family retreated to during a war.

In addition to being used as a shelter during war, King Jeongjo also stayed here during trips to worship at his father's tomb. The palace was the location of a splendid feast held on the 60th birthday of his mother, Hyegyeonggung Hong, and many other events, including award certificates for successful candidates of special national exams.

The temple used to be larger, maintaining 36 buildings on the premises and 132 hermitages spread over the mountain, but these facilities were completely destroyed during the Japanese invasions of Korea from 1592-1598 and the Korean War from 1950-1953. The temple that stands today was reconstructed in 1955. The road leading to the entrance of Surisa Temple offers gorgeous scenery with a beautiful forest and valley lining its sides; it is as if the mountain itself surrounds the temple like a painted screen.","regDate":"2022-09-08","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-08-1662626904896/1252700_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-09-08-1662626904896"},{"id":"2022-09-08-1662623445837","title":"Supullo Unsimni (ÏàòÌíÄÎ°ú Ïö¥Ïã¨Î¶¨)","description":"Opened in 2004, Supullo Unsimni is situated on the Namhangang Riverside.

This has contributed to an improvement in the water quality of the Hangang River. The center was built to restore the Namhangang Riverside area, which was destroyed due to sand extraction, and to restore its natural ecology of willow trees, reeds, and birds.
