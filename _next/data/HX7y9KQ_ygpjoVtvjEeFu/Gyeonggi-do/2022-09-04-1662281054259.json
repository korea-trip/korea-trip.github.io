The temple used to be larger, maintaining 36 buildings on the premises and 132 hermitages spread over the mountain, but these facilities were completely destroyed during the Japanese invasions of Korea from 1592-1598 and the Korean War from 1950-1953.

This has contributed to an improvement in the water quality of the Hangang River. The center was built to restore the Namhangang Riverside area, which was destroyed due to sand extraction, and to restore its natural ecology of willow trees, reeds, and birds.
