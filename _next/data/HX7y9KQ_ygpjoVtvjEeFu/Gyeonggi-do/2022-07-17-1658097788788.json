In addition, you can walk, swim, or exercise in the water stream pool, which has a depth of 120 centimeters. <br><br>Icheon Termeden started as a hot spring spa, but it plans to expand further into a multi-resort complex, which will include hotel and condominium facilities, an arboretum, a golf driving range, and horseback riding.","regDate":"2022-09-09","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Hot Springs & Spa"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-09-1662706944231/2041309_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-09-09-1662706944231"},{"id":"2022-09-09-1662703678782","title":"Temporary Palace at Hwaseong Fortress (Hwaseong Haenggung Palace) (화성행궁)","description":"A <em>haenggung</em> is a temporary palace where the king and royal family retreated to during a war.

The temple used to be larger, maintaining 36 buildings on the premises and 132 hermitages spread over the mountain, but these facilities were completely destroyed during the Japanese invasions of Korea from 1592-1598 and the Korean War from 1950-1953. The temple that stands today was reconstructed in 1955. The road leading to the entrance of Surisa Temple offers gorgeous scenery with a beautiful forest and valley lining its sides; it is as if the mountain itself surrounds the temple like a painted screen.","regDate":"2022-09-08","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-08-1662626904896/1252700_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-09-08-1662626904896"},{"id":"2022-09-08-1662623445837","title":"Supullo Unsimni (수풀로 운심리)","description":"Opened in 2004, Supullo Unsimni is situated on the Namhangang Riverside.

This has contributed to an improvement in the water quality of the Hangang River. The center was built to restore the Namhangang Riverside area, which was destroyed due to sand extraction, and to restore its natural ecology of willow trees, reeds, and birds. The center organizes a number of ecological excursion programs for children.","regDate":"2022-09-08","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Eco-Tourism Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-08-1662623445837/1099393_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-09-08-1662623445837"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
