The name of the mountain comes from the fact that the ridgeline looks like a dragon wearing a chickens crest on its head. The topographical features are what make this mountain stand out and its mysterious folklore is what makes it so interesting. The park features many peaks, including the main peak Cheonhwangbong (alt. 845.1 m), as well as Sambulbong, Yeoncheonbong, and Gwaneumbong Peaks. This mountain is famous for its many interesting sites, with its fantastic rock structures and Yongmunpokpo Falls on the west, Eunseonpokpo Falls to the east, and Amyongchu and Sutyongchupokpo Falls in the south. <br><Br>In spring, cherry blossoms bloom along the path to Donghaksa Temple, and during summer the lush green of the valley is very beautiful. During fall, the maple trees reveal their crimson colored leaves around Gapsa Temple and Yongmunpokpo Falls. The snowcapped peak of Sambulbong in winter is simply breathtaking. Gyeryongsan is full of rare animals and plants, beautiful waterfalls and a rich history with mysterious legends and cultural treasures. To the east is Donghaksa Temple; northwest, Gapsa Temple; southwest, Sinwonsa Temple; and southeast, Yonghwasa Temple.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-42-825-3002|\n|parking:|Available (Donghaksa Temple Parking Lot 1/2, Gapsa Temple Parking Lot 1/2)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Night-time Hike Restriction Notice:|To protect the environment and ensure the safety of hikers, hiking is prohibited at night (from sunset until two hours before sunrise).|\n|Available Facilities:|Donghaksa Information Center, Donghaksa Campground, Visitors Center|\n|Parking Fees:|Light-weight vehicles (less than 1,000cc): 2,000 won <br> Sedans (more than 1,000cc): 4,000 won (peak season: 5,000 won) <br>Buses: 6,000 won (peak season: 7,500 won)|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-08-1667886221428/780730_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-08-1667886221428/780730_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-08-1667886221428/1600076_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-08-1667886221428/1600076_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-08-1667886221428/1598626_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-08-1667886221428/1598626_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-08-1667886221428/1600078_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-08-1667886221428/1600078_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-08-1667886221428/1600079_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-08-1667886221428/1600079_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-08-1667886221428/1600080_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-08-1667886221428/1600080_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-08-1667886221428/1600081_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-08-1667886221428/1600081_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-08-1667886221428/1600082_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-08-1667886221428/1600082_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-42-825-3002](tel:+82428253002)\n- [üè†gyeryong.knps.or.kr](http://gyeryong.knps.or.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.3568732990\nlongitude: 127.2324620609\ntitle: 327-6, Donghaksa 1-ro, Gongju-si, Chungcheongnam-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-08-1667886221428","title":"Gyeryongsan National Park (Í≥ÑÎ£°ÏÇ∞Íµ≠Î¶ΩÍ≥µÏõê)","description":"Gyeryongsan National Park stretches across the cities of Daejeon, Gongju, and Nonsan in Chungcheongnam-do and was made a national park on December 31, 1968.
