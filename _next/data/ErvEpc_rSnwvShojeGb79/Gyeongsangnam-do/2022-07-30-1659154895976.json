Unlike his predecessors, Lee listens to the story of the ghost and finds the low-ranked officer who had killed her and punishes him.

Aranggak was also built in her memory. <br><br>\n\nEvery year, an event called Arangje is held on April 16 by the lunar calendar in Aranggak Pavilion. Young maidens dressed in white hanbok perform a religious ceremony to soothe the sorrow of Arang.
