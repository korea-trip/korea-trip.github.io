Naejangsan Mountain has been referred to as the “Geumgang of Honam” since the Joseon dynasty.<br><br>Naejangsan Mountain is about 11 kilometers away from downtown Jeongeup, and its name means many secrets in the mountains. The highest peak of Naejangsan Mountain is Sinseonbong Peak, which is 763 meters above sea level. The nine peaks of the mountain stand in a circle, similar to the shape of a horse’s hoof.

The length of each course varies from 1.5 to 14 kilometers. For those who are not able to trek long distances, walking the 3.6 kilometer-long nature trail that leads to the flatland is a good option.

The land was purchased by French Priest Baudenet in 1891 (28th year of King Gojong), but construction of the church did not begin until 1908. The church was designed by Priest Poinel, who also designed the famous Myeongdong Cathedral in Seoul. Construction was completed in 1914, a time during which Korea was under Japanese rule. Though originally built just outside of Pungnammun Gate, the site of the martyrs, the church was later moved to its current location for expansion.  <br><br>The first Romanesque building in the Honam region, Jeondong Catholic Cathedral is made of gray and red bricks and bears a striking resemblance to the Myeongdong Cathedral in Seoul. Not only considered one of the most beautiful Catholic churches in Korea, some even go so far as to say it is one of the most beautiful structures in all of Korea, citing the church’s unique combination of Byzantine and Romanesque architectural styles. The rectangular building is topped with three Byzantine bell towers (to the right, center, and left) and boasts arched ceilings, several of which meet in the form of a cross. <br><br>It is interesting to note that some of the bricks used in construction of the church were made using materials from the Jeonjueupseong Walled Town, which was torn down by the Japanese. It is also said that the cornerstone of the church came from a wall of Jeonjueupseong Walled Town near Pungnammun Gate.","regDate":"2023-01-04","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Holy Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-04-1672810566980/2641989_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-04-1672810566980"},{"id":"2023-01-04-1672807110323","title":"Jeoksangsanseong Fortress (무주 적상산성)","description":"Jeoksangsan Mountain (elevation 1,034m) in Muju, Jeollabuk-do, is surrounded by precipitous walls of stratified rocks.

The mountain boasts a variety of attractions from Hyangnobong Peak (1,029 meters), Cheonilpokpo Falls, Songdaepokpo Falls, Jangdobawi Rock, Janggunbawi Rock, and Allyeomdae Cliff.<br><br>The rugged shape of the mountain was considered ideal for building a fortress. And after Jeoksangsan became a designated site for storing Joseonwangjo Sillok (annals of the Joseon Dynasty), the fortress surrounding it was further rebuilt. The mountain is also home to Anguksa Temple, an ancient temple built in 1227 (during the 3rd year of King Chungryeol’s reign) by Monk Wolin. The mountain can easily be climbed by hiking or by vehicle; there is a paved road stretching over 15 kilometers that leads to the top of the mountain thanks to the construction of Muju Power Plant, letting tourists visit Sanjeong Lake and Anguksa Temple conveniently.","regDate":"2023-01-03","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-03-1672742201681/2719978_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-03-1672742201681"},{"id":"2023-01-03-1672738548256","title":"Jeokbyeokgang Cliffs [National Geopark] (적벽강 (전북 서해안 국가지질공원))","description":"The area around Jeokbyeokgang Cliffs features great plant distribution value, including a population of Machilus, a designated natural monument.
