The lush forest covers an area of 8,265 ㎡ with the trees being nearly 500 years old. The best time to enjoy the camellias is from late March to early May. Dongbaekjeong Pavilion at the peak of the hill offers a beautiful view of the nearby Oryeokdo Island in the blue sea and is also a prime spot for taking in the sunset. <br><br>The western side of the forest has few remaining trees, but the eastern side is still lush with over 70 trees. While camellia trees typically grow to be 7 meters tall, the strong sea breeze has caused the trees in this forest to have a stunted growth of just 2 meters, as well as growing at a slant.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-41-952-7999|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|January 1, the day of Seolllal (Lunar New Year’s Day) & Chuseok (Korean Thanksgiving Day)|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00 (Winter season 09:00-17:00)<br>* Last admission 30 min before closing|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 1,000 won / Teenagers 700 won / Children 500 won<br>Groups - Adults 800 won / Teenagers 500 won / Children 400 won<br><br>* Groups: 30 people or more<br>* Free admission: Preschoolers (ages 6 & younger), senior citizens (ages 65 & older)|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Dongbaekjeong Pavilion, Maryangdangjip House, drinking fountain, etc.|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-12-1668245960737/2026502_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-12-1668245960737/2026502_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-12-1668245960737/2026503_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-12-1668245960737/2026503_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-12-1668245960737/2026504_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-12-1668245960737/2026504_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-12-1668245960737/2482719_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-12-1668245960737/2482719_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-41-952-7999](tel:+82419527999)\n- [🏠www.seocheon.go.kr](http://www.seocheon.go.kr/tour/sub01_01_01.do)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.1379050125\nlongitude: 126.4935201987\ntitle: 103, Seoin-ro 235beon-gil, Seocheon-gun, Chungcheongnam-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-12-1668245960737","title":"Seocheon Maryang-ri Camellia Forest (서천 마량리 동백나무 숲)","description":"One of the eight scenic views of Seocheon, Maryang-ri Camellia Forest is designated as Natural Monument No. 169.

The temple is easily accessble from downtown despite its location deep within a valley at the foot of Geumosan Mountain, serving as a landmark for visitors enjoying a light stroll or a hike up to the mountain. Serving as a home to several relics and a nine-story stone pagoda, the temple site and buildings are well maintained and neatly cleaned on a daily basis.  <br><br>According to legends, Monk Euigak originally had planned on building a temple in Sinam-myeon in Yesan. He went to China and brought a Buddha statue, praying earnestly on his way back aboard a boat. Upon his arrival, he sighted a pair of golden crows flying above the boat and followed the birds before they disappeared. He found the birds at the temples current location, drinking from a puddle of water that had an aromatic smell. From then on the mountain was called Geumosan, meaning the mountain of golden crow, and the temple was named Hyangcheonsa, meaning the temple of fragrant water.","regDate":"2022-11-18","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-18-1668768128450/1962103_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Chungcheongnam-do/2022-11-18-1668768128450"},{"id":"2022-11-18-1668764409764","title":"Yeonpo Beach (연포해수욕장)","description":"Located on the Taean Coast, Yeonpo Beach has been a popular vacation spot since 1972.
