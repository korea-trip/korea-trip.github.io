The pine trees surrounding the beach are protected areas, and visitors are prohibited from entering. Surfing is another draw of the beach, and the surf shop offers lessons and equipment rentals. Scuba diving is also available on site.

This experience is offered free of charge during the opening of the beach, and requires payment for periods outside the vacation season. Prior reservation is required through the official website.

When Taejo of Goryeo was surrounded by the army of Gyeon Hwon (founder of Later Baekje) at the Palgongsan Battle in Daegu, Sin exchanged armor with Taejo‚Äôs armor to disguise himself as the king and died. The enemy thought that he was Taejo and beheaded him, and Taejo made his head with gold in sorrow and held a funeral for him. The Tomb of Sin Sung-gyeom consists of three mounds, which are said to have been a measure that Taejo took lest the golden head should be stolen. The location of the tomb is regarded as one of the best propitious sites for a grave in Korea, based on geomancy. Surrounded by pine trees, this site overlooks downtown Chuncheon.

According to a legend, Monks Yeongseo, Hyewon, and Yeonok all had envisioned the location in their dreams in which a white-haired heavenly man appeared and indicated them the place of the temple. Thus, the temple was re-constructed at the current location and renamed as ‚ÄúSinheungsa,‚Äù meaning ‚Äúthe temple was blessed by God (sin) and became prosper (heung). However, the Chinese character sin of the temple‚Äôs name was changed in 1995 from sin meaning god to sin meaning ‚Äúnew,‚Äù wishing that the temple will revive Buddhism again in the Yeongdong area (eastern part of the Taebaek Mountain Range). Sinheungsa Temple is home to many cultural heritages including the Geungnakbojeon Hall at Sinheungsa Temple (Treasure) and the Three-story Stone Pagoda at Hyangseongsa Temple Site (Treasure), which is standing on the opposite side of Kensington Star Hotel .
