To the northwest of the Huirisan Pine Tree Recreational Forest is Saindae. Legend goes that four generals used to play there. Indeed, there is a cliff (140m in x_height) just below Saindae where they were believed to do chin-ups. Naturally, people call the area Teokgeolijang (Chin-Up Spot). Traces of Munsusa Temple still remain below Munsubong although it was said to have been destroyed by a huge number of bedbugs. 500m from Munsubong to the south, horse riding trails of the four generals are dotted along the ridge; Malttongbawi (Horse Dung Rock), resembling horse droppings, is 500m from the peak to the southeast.<br><br>Below Munsubong are four large peaks where the four generals lived and 100 small rocks beneath them that were home to low ranking men commanded by the generals. Because of their unique shapes, those rocks form a scenic sight while hiking in Huirisan.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-41-953-2230|\n|opendate:|1999|\n|parking:|Available (60 parking spaces)|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00<BR>* Accommodations: 15:00-13:00 (the following day)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Adults (ages 19-64): Adults 1,000 won / Groups 800 won <br>Teenagers (ages 13-18): Adults 600 won / Groups 500 won <br>Children (ages 7-12): Adults 300 won / Groups 200 won<br>* Groups of 20 people or more<BR>* Free admission during winter season (December-March)|\n|Facility Utilization Fees:|Forest Cabin: Low Season & Weekdays 40,000-110,000 won / Peak Season & Weekends 73,000-185,000 won<br><br>Lodging Complex:  Low Season & Weekdays 52,000-110,000 won / Peak Season & Weekends 94,000-185,000 won <br><br>Forest Training Center: Low Season & Weekdays 402,000 won / Peak Season & Weekends 550,000 won<br><br>Camping Deck: Low Season & Weekdays 7,000 won / Peak Season & Weekends 8,500 won<br>Camping site with camping cars (80 ㎡ and under): Low Season & Weekdays 16,000 won / Peak Season & Weekends 28,000 won <br>* Peak Season: July 15 - August 24 / Weekends: Friday, Saturday, Public Holidays<BR>* Parking fee for vehicle camping site, cabins and camping car sites will be waived. |\n|Parking Fees:|Compact cars: 1,500 won<br>Small & Mid-sized cars: 3,000 won<br>Large-sized vehicles: 5,000 won|\n|Available Facilities:|* Services and facilities: Parking lot, camping deck, hiking course, walking path, pavilion, grass field, etc.<br>* Amenities: Cooking site, shower booth, forest house<br>* Sports facility: Multi-purpose sports facility|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-09-1667970473433/217650_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-09-1667970473433/217650_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-09-1667970473433/2032733_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-09-1667970473433/2032733_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-09-1667970473433/2032734_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-09-1667970473433/2032734_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-09-1667970473433/2032735_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-09-1667970473433/2032735_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-09-1667970473433/2032736_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-09-1667970473433/2032736_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-09-1667970473433/2032737_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-09-1667970473433/2032737_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-09-1667970473433/2032738_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-09-1667970473433/2032738_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-09-1667970473433/2032739_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-09-1667970473433/2032739_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-09-1667970473433/2032740_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-09-1667970473433/2032740_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-09-1667970473433/217660_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-09-1667970473433/217660_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-41-953-2230](tel:+82419532230)\n- [🏠www.huyang.go.kr](http://www.huyang.go.kr)\n\n\n\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus + Taxi]<BR>\nFrom  Seoul Nambu Terminal, take a bus to Seocheon Intercity Bus Terminal.<br><br>From Seocheon Intercity Bus \nTerminal Bus Stop, take a bus bound for Chunjangdae Beach and get off at Jongcheon-myeon Bus Stop.<br>Take a taxi for approx. 10 min.\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-09-1667970473433","title":"Huirisan Pine Tree National Recreational Forest (국립 희리산해송자연휴양림)","description":"Surrounded by majestic pine trees, Huirisan Mountain boasts an outstanding landscape; there is a reservoir at the foot of the mountain.
