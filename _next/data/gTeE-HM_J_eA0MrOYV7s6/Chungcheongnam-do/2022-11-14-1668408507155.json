Originally, the temple was called Samseonam, or Three Hermitages, for there had been three hermitages in the upper, middle, and lower part of Buchunsan Mountain. During the late Joseon dynasty, the hermitages in the upper and middle part were closed and only the one at the bottom survived.  In 1987, the name was changed to Seogwangsa Temple.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<Br>• For more info: +82-41-664-2002|\n|parking:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-14-1668408507155/2401980_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-14-1668408507155/2401980_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-14-1668408507155/2401995_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-14-1668408507155/2401995_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-41-664-2002](tel:+82416642002)\n- [🏠www.seogwangsa.or.kr</a><br><a href=\"http://www.templestay.com\"target=\"_blank\">www.templestay.com](http://www.seogwangsa.or.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.7917318231\nlongitude: 126.4454185006\ntitle: 44, Buchunsan 1-ro, Seosan-si, Chungcheongnam-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-14-1668408507155","title":"Seosan Seogwangsa Temple (서광사(서산))","description":"Seongwangsa Temple is located in the quiet downtown area of Eupnae-dong, Seosan in Chungcheongnam-do.
