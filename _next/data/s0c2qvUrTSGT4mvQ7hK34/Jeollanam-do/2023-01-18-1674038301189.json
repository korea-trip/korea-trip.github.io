The island has rough mountain ridges and consists of cliffs, making a magnificent scenery. With Doksilsan Mountain (alt. 639 m, the highest peak in Sinan-gun) standing in the middle, the island is surrounded by cliffs, creating a mysterious aura. The area is loved by fishers as various fish like anchovy, croaker, hairtail, horse mackerel, sea bream, and others can be found in the surrounding waters, as well as a paradise of unusual migratory birds like the fork-tailed petrel, shearwater, and teal.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<BR>• For more info: +82-61-275-9300|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Film Locations:|Variety Show \"2 Days & 1 Night\"|\n|Tour Course Information:|1) Route 1: Daltteulmok – No. 1 Bunker – No. 2 Bunker – Saetgaejae Pass<br>2) Route 2: Saetgaejae Pass – Hoeryongsan Mountain – 1-gu Village<br>3) Route 3: No. 1 Bunker – Samgeori Intersection – Doksilsan Mountain<br>4) Route 4: Doksilsan Mountain – Gageodo Lighthouse<br>5) Route 5: Gageodo Lighthouse – 3-gu Village – Samgeori Intersection<br>6) Route 6: 2-gu Village – Gageodo Lighthouse <br>7) Route 7: Doksilsan Mountain – 2-gu Village|\n|Available Facilities:|Accommodations, Songnyeon Post Box, lighthouse, restaurants, etc.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-18-1674038301189/2026830_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-18-1674038301189/2026830_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-18-1674038301189/2026833_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-18-1674038301189/2026833_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-18-1674038301189/2026836_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-18-1674038301189/2026836_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-18-1674038301189/2026840_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-18-1674038301189/2026840_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-18-1674038301189/2026831_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-18-1674038301189/2026831_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-18-1674038301189/2026835_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-18-1674038301189/2026835_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-18-1674038301189/2026838_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-18-1674038301189/2026838_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-61-275-9300](tel:+82612759300)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 34.0740166502\nlongitude: 125.1125145360\ntitle: 38-2, Gageodo-gil, Sinan-gun, Jeollanam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Ferry]<br>\nTake a ferry from Mokpo Port Coastal Terminal to Gageodo Island.\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-18-1674038301189","title":"Gageodo Island (Soheuksando Island) (가거도(소흑산도))","description":"Gageodo Island is the southwesternmost island in Korea, located rather close to China.
