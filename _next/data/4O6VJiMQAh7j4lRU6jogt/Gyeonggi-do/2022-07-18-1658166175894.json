Attractions include an artificial wave pool with a x_width of 120 meters and a length of 104 meters, a lazy river that passes through indoor and outdoor pools, and various slides that maximize adventure and thrill. Indoor facilities include a wave pool, slides, spas, and saunas. One of the park's best attractions is Mega Storm, a super large complex water slide. The circular tube starts from the boarding platform 37 meters above the ground and travels 355 meters rotating in all directions going up and down three rapid descents. The last part of the ride is a large 18 meter funnel shaped tornado that gives riders a zero gravity experience for about 55 to 60 seconds.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-31-320-5000|\n|opendate:|July 1996|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|* Refer to the official website|\n|usetime:|[Indoor facilities] 10:00-18:00<br>[Outdoor facilities] 10:00-17:00<br>* Subject to change; check before visiting|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Please refer to the official website|\n|Available Facilities:|[Outdoor facilities]<br> Tower Raft, Tower Boomerang Go, Wild Blaster, Wild River Pool, Adventure Pool, Water Bobsleigh, Wave Pool, Mega Storm, etc.<br><br> [Indoor facilities]<br> Indoor Wave Pool, Indoor Kids‚Äô Pool, Spa, Sauna<br><br> [Convenience facilities]<br> Baby service center, food storage and picnic area, lockers, medical office, family shower room, etc.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Reservation Info. for Foreigners:|Advance reservation required|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-18-1658166175894/1590015_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-18-1658166175894/1590015_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-18-1658166175894/2504502_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-18-1658166175894/2504502_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-18-1658166175894/2504503_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-18-1658166175894/2504503_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-18-1658166175894/2504506_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-18-1658166175894/2504506_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-31-320-5000](tel:+82313205000)\n- [üè†www.everland.com](http://www.everland.com/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.2933788242\nlongitude: 127.2013390401\ntitle: 199, Everland-ro, Cheoin-gu, Yongin-si, Gyeonggi-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-18-1658166175894","title":"Caribbean Bay (Ï∫êÎ¶¨ÎπÑÏïàÎ≤†Ïù¥)","description":"Caribbean Bay is a world-class water park with various attractions and health facilities based on the theme of the Caribbean coast.

The island was revealed when seawaters were blocked during a land reclamation project. As the sedimentary layer formed during the Cretaceous period of the Mesozoic Era (dated around 83 million to 85 million years ago) was eroded by weathering, roughly 200 dinosaur eggs in thirty nests were discovered at twelve dig sites. It is anticipated that more fossils will be discovered once a thorough investigation is carried out and more land is reclaimed.<br><be>Most dinosaur eggs are oval shaped and dark red. Considering the properties of the fossilized shells, the eggs that have been discovered so far are assumed to belong to four-legged herbivorous dinosaurs with a long neck and tail, and two-legged herbivorous dinosaurs, including the hadrosaur. A wide range of plant fossils were also discovered alongside the fossilized eggs, leading to expectations that the formerly lush environment may yet be restored.<br><br>The discovery of the Fossilized Dinosaur Egg Site in Hwaseong has greatly expanded the scope of Korean paleontology; previous paleontological discoveries were exclusively limited to fossilized dinosaur footprints. This significant discovery has attracted many internationally renowned scholars who have visited the site in Hwaseong.","regDate":"2022-08-27","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Eco-Tourism Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-27-1661582774696/2040876_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-08-27-1661582774696"},{"id":"2022-08-27-1661579189055","title":"Hwaseomun Gate (ÌôîÏÑúÎ¨∏)","description":"Hwaseomun Gate is the western gate of Hwaseong Fortress, Treasure No. 403.
