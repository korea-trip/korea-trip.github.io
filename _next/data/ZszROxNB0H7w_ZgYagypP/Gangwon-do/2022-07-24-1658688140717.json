Its name reflects its dedication to the value of rest by freedom from the troubles of mundane life. The temple was built in 1997 by the monk Hongbeop as a small Buddha hall named Myojeokjeon Hall, but the discovery of a large rock shaped like a reclining Avalokiteshvara in 1999 made the temple a popular site for prayers. A large rock named Yeonhwadae, named after its shape of a lotus flower in bloom, is located below the Myojeokjeon Hall near the sea. Yeonhwadae is a great place to see the reclining Avalokiteshvara and turtle-shaped rock in the area, and many other tourists flock to see the interesting rock formations of the area, like toe rocks, foot rock, and fist rock. Lucky visitors can catch a glimpse of schools of big-scaled redfin surfacing to feed at the beach. Hyuhyuam Hermitage is also home to Myojeokjeon Hall, Darani Cave Buddha Hall, Gwaneum Buddhist Bell, and a statue of the Avalokiteshvara. The Avalokiteshvara statue, in particular, enjoys great popularity from its hilltop vantage point, having the blue seas of the East Sea to its back.","regDate":"2022-09-23","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-23-1663914439662/2711354_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-09-23-1663914439662"},{"id":"2022-09-23-1663909574042","title":"Gangneung Gyeongpo Beach (Í∞ïÎ¶â Í≤ΩÌè¨ÏàòÏöïÏû•)","description":"Located 1 kilometer away from Gyeongpodae Pavilion and 6 kilometers from downtown Gangneung, Gyeongpo Beach is a sand bank formed between Gyeongpoho Lake and the ocean.

However, along with the opening of the double-track railway on the Gyeongchun Line in 2010, the Gangchon Station building was relocated and consequently, the number of visitors has decreased and the local business experienced depression. Therefore, there has been a campaign to revitalize Gangchon. Near the former Gangchon Station, the large sculpture ‚ÄúDdo-ori Gangchon‚Äù has been installed, and the reduced-size model of the Deungseongyo Bridge (suspension bridge), which was a famous tourist attraction in the past, has been reproduced. In particular, ‚ÄúDdo-ori Gangchon,‚Äù which is a popular photo zone, was built by embodying the Scaly-side Merganser (Mergus squamatus, Natural Monument No. 448), which come the area of Gangchon in winter. Additionally, the Deungseongyo Bridge, which was Korea‚Äôs first suspension bridge, but demolished in 1985, was reproduced as a tourist pedestrian bridge with a length of 58 m.
