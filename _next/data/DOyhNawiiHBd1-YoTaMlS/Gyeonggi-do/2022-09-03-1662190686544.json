The gate has an entrance wide enough to let the king's palanquin pass through and a watchtower over the entrance.  Outside of the gate is a crescent-shaped protection wall called <em>ongseong</em>. <br><br>Among the ongseong walls found across the country, Paldalmun Gate's ongseong wall stands out in terms of size and form. The hip roof and decorations seen on Paldalmun Gate's watchtower resemble that of fortress watchtowers, and are recognized as representation of late Joseon dynasty's watchtower architecture.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-31-228-2765|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|March-October 09:00-18:00 <br />November-February 09:00-17:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:| [Suwon Hwaseong Fortress]<br> Individuals: Adults 1,000 won / Teenagers 700 won / Children 500 won<br> Groups: Adults 700 won / Teenagers 500 won / Children 300 won<br><br> [Temporary Palace at Hwaseong Fortress] <br> Individuals: Adults 1,500 won / Teenagers 1,000 won / Children 700 won<br> Groups: Adults 1,200 won / Teenagers 800 won / Children 500 won<br><br> * Groups: 20 people or more<br> * Free admission for children age 6 and under & senior citizens age 65 and older|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Available (English, Japanese)|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-09-03-1662190686544/734418_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-03-1662190686544/734418_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-03-1662190686544/734422_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-03-1662190686544/734422_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-03-1662190686544/734425_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-03-1662190686544/734425_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-03-1662190686544/2482974_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-03-1662190686544/2482974_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-03-1662190686544/2482975_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-03-1662190686544/2482975_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-03-1662190686544/2482977_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-03-1662190686544/2482977_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-03-1662190686544/2482980_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-03-1662190686544/2482980_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-03-1662190686544/2482982_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-03-1662190686544/2482982_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-03-1662190686544/2482985_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-03-1662190686544/2482985_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-03-1662190686544/734421_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-03-1662190686544/734421_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-31-228-2765](tel:+82312282765)\n- [üè†www.swcf.or.kr](http://www.swcf.or.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.2775356819\nlongitude: 127.0167173433\ntitle: 780, Jeongjo-ro, Paldal-gu, Suwon-si, Gyeonggi-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway + Bus]<br>\nFrom Suwon Station (Seoul Subway Line 1), take Bus No. 11, 13, 36, 38, 39, 46, 24, or 46-1 and get off at Paldalmun Gate Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-09-03-1662190686544","title":"Paldalmun Gate (ÌåîÎã¨Î¨∏)","description":"Paldalmun Gate is the southern gate of Hwaseong Fortress, and its name means a gate opening to a road that leads to all directions.
