It was identified as an Acheulean Paleolithic stone implement by an expert, and gained the attention of paleontologists from around the world. The Jeongok-ri Prehistoric Site is situated on a basalt deposit that was likely formed during the Precambrian era. With the discovery of soil wedge and tephra indicating the top layer to be estimated at least 20,000 years old,  the region is also considered highly valuable among geologists.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <BR>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info +82-839-2561~3|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|Mondays (next day if Monday is a public holiday), January 1|\n|usetime:|March-October 09:00-18:00<br> November-February 09:00-17:00<br /> * Last ticketing 30 min before closing|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Adults: 1,000 won / Students: 500 won <br> * Group tour: Group of 20 or more gets 20% off the regular ticket price <br>* Free admission: Senior citizens (ages 65 and older) and preschoolers (ages 6 and younger)|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Exhibition hall, bicycle rack, snack bar, etc.|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-29-1661762901742/2616261_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661762901742/2616261_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-29-1661762901742/2616262_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661762901742/2616262_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-29-1661762901742/2616263_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-29-1661762901742/2616263_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-31-839-2561](tel:+82318392561)\n- [üè†www.yeoncheon.go.kr</a><br><a href=\"http://www.cha.go.kr/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Î¨∏ÌôîÏû¨Ï≤≠ ÏÇ¨Ïù¥Ìä∏Î°ú Ïù¥Îèô\">www.cha.go.kr</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hantangeopark.kr/\" target=\"_blank\">www.hantangeopark.kr](https://www.yeoncheon.go.kr/seonsa/index.do)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 38.0141230215\nlongitude: 127.0601923844\ntitle: 1510, Yangyeon-ro, Yeoncheon-gun, Gyeonggi-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-29-1661762901742","title":"Jeongok-ri Prehistoric Site - Hantangang River Geopark (Ïó∞Ï≤ú Ï†ÑÍ≥°Î¶¨ Ïú†Ï†Å-ÌïúÌÉÑÍ∞ï Íµ≠Í∞ÄÏßÄÏßàÍ≥µÏõê)","description":"The Jeongok-ri Prehistoric Site is the prime site on the Korean peninsula for the study of Paleolithic relics, and was unearthed after the discovery of a stone implement by an American soldier who was visiting an amusement park near Hantangang River in the winter of 1978.
