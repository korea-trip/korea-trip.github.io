In 1846, the Nongae-saeng-jang-hyang-su-myeong-bi monument was put up in praise of Nongae‚Äôs patriotism. In 1955, a shrine was built and named Uiamsa, which was then moved to the current location in 1974. Within the precincts of the shrine are a memorial stone, the portrait of Nongae by artist Kim Eun-ho, and three gates Woesammun, Naesammun and Chunguimun erected one after another. At the memorial hall, the existing possessions of Nongae and her husband General Choi Gyeong-hoe are on display. The annual Nongae Festival takes places on September 3rd by the lunar calendar, during which memorial services and cultural events are held to commemorate Nongae.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-63-350-2326|\n|parking:|Available|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00 (Winter 09:00-17:00)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Memorial Hall, monument house, etc.|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798134_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798134_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798184_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798184_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798188_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798188_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798191_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798191_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798200_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798200_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798210_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798210_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798223_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798223_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798227_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798227_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798239_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798239_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798162_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-08-1673148955286/798162_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-63-350-2326](tel:+82633502326)\n- [üè†www.cha.go.kr](http://www.cha.go.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.6411181919\nlongitude: 127.5180751461\ntitle: 393, Hannuri-ro, Jangsu-gun, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>From Jangsu Intercity Bus Terminal, walk for approx. 10 min.\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-08-1673148955286","title":"Nongae Shrine (Uiamsa Shrine) (ÎÖºÍ∞úÏÇ¨Îãπ(ÏùòÏïîÏÇ¨))","description":"Uiamsa Shrine was built to the memory of Chu Nongae, who sacrificed her life during the Imjin War (Japanese Invasion of Korea).

The valley is also befittingly named Baniram since it is so deep that it only receives direct sunlight for half the day. There are many strangely-shaped rocks like Jjokduri Rock, Cheollyeop Rock, and Daebul Rock scattered throughout the lush valley. At the peak of summer, the area is crowded with vacationers and is also popular for its autumn leaves.","regDate":"2023-01-10","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Valleys"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-10-1673332804228/219600_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-10-1673332804228"},{"id":"2023-01-10-1673328964294","title":"Uhwajeong Pavilion (Ïö∞ÌôîÏ†ï(ÎÇ¥Ïû•ÏÇ∞))","description":"Uhwajeong Pavilion takes its name from the legend that the pavilion once grew wings and ascended into the heavens.

Tapsa Temple is famous for the over 80 stone pagodas built by Lee Gapyong, a retired scholar. Those stone pagodas have different sizes and shapes from cone-shaped to straight-shaped. Behind Daeungjeon, Cheonjitap tower is located. It is the largest tower, with a x_height 3 times as high as the average adult‚Äôs x_height. How this tall tower was built is still unclear, drawing much attention from people. It is said that those stone pagodas were made in the late 1800s entirely by Lee Gapyong alone. He collected stones in daytime and built the pagodas at night. Even though the pagodas have been around for more than 100 years, they have never collapsed nor even moved through strong winds, making them truly amazing.<br>Tapsa Temple is also well known for cherry blossoms in spring, covering an area of 1.9km from Nambu (south) parking lot of Maisan Mountain to the entrance (a 30min walk). This road is the venue for Maisan Cherry Blossom Festival as well. <br><br>* Cheonjitap is comprised of two twin pagodas with x_heights of 13.5m and placed in the south and north directions. Cheonjitap is the main pagoda, making the other pagodas at Tapsa Temple look well-balanced. It is believed that 120 towers originally existed, but only 80 of them remain today. The two towers at the very front are named Ilgwangtap and Wolgwangtap. These groups of towers are strong enough to stand up to typhoon winds, something quite hard to believe, giving the towers a certain mystery. Also, towers are tilted slightly in both directions, showing that Lee Gapyong erected the towers with the direction of the wind in mind.","regDate":"2023-01-10","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-10-1673325568605/1605767_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-10-1673325568605"},{"id":"2023-01-10-1673321782101","title":"Taekwondowon Observatory (ÌÉúÍ∂åÎèÑÍ≥µÏõê Ï†ÑÎßùÎåÄ)","description":"Taekwondowon located in Muju-gun, Jeollabuk-do, serves as a main center for the 60 million taekwondo practitioners in 182 countries worldwide.

In the third year of King Chungsuk of Goryeo (1316), the temple saw the addition of a five-story stone pagoda, built by Monk Deokhyeon. At its peak, the temple was said to have had 12 hermitages and housed 1,000 monks. It was burned down during the Imjin War (1592-1598), leaving only the pagoda, but was rebuilt a few years later by Monk Soyo during the 37th year of King Seonjo (1604). Unfortunately, the temple was burned down again in the Korean War, but was once again restored to its original state in 1959. <br><br>Cultural assets found at the temple include Stone Guardian Post of Chungsin-ri & Namgye-ri, Sunchang Guesthouse, and the Three-story Stone Pagoda of Sunhwa-ri.
