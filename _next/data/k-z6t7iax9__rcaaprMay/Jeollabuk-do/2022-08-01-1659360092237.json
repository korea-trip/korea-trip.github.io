Full of thick groves of larch trees, Korean white pines, rigida pines, and plenty of broad-leaved trees, the forest and its streams offer a cool and refreshing retreat. In spring, the forest is beautiful with wildflowers, azaleas and wild cherry blossom trees. In summer, families flock to the streams shaded by the thick forest canopy. As summer turns into fall, the whole area transforms into a rainbow of bright yellow, red, and orange. With the coming of winter, the snow covers the trees and blankets the ground, turning the forest in a winter dreamland.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|accomcount:|Up to 5,000 people|\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-63-263-8680|\n|opendate:|July 23, 1998|\n|parking:|Available (600 spaces)|\n|usetime:|[Accommodations] Check in 15:00 / Check out 11:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 2,000 won / Teenagers 1,500 won / Children 1,000 won<br>Groups - Adults 1,500 won / Teenagers 1,000 won / Children 500 won<br /><br />* Group: 30 people or more|\n|Available Facilities:|* Accommodations: Forest House, Hyuyanggwan, camping site<br>* Grass plaza, restaurants, snack bar<br>* Other facilities: Fitness facilities, playgrounds, water play area, hiking path (29 km), multi-purpose plaza, campfire area, outdoor stage, outdoor classrooms, etc.|\n|Facility Utilization Fees:|[Forest House & Recreation Hall]<br>Peak Season 60,000-200,000 won / Low Season 40,000-160,000 won<br><br>[Seminar Room]<br>120,000 won (4 hours / 30,000 won per hour)<br>* Admission fee charged separately.<br><br>[Caravan]<br>Peak Season 60,000 won / Low Season 40,000 won<br><br>[Dome House]<br>Peak Season 70,000 won / Low Season 50,000 won[Adventure Facilities]<br>- Sonogong Course: Individuals 5,000 won / Groups 4,000 won<br>- Jeopalgye Course: Individuals 7,000 won / Groups 6,000 won<br>- Super Board Course: Individuals 7,000 won / Groups 6,000 won|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-01-1659360092237/609004_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659360092237/609004_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659360092237/609006_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659360092237/609006_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659360092237/609008_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659360092237/609008_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659360092237/609010_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659360092237/609010_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659360092237/609011_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659360092237/609011_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659360092237/609013_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659360092237/609013_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659360092237/609016_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659360092237/609016_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659360092237/609019_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659360092237/609019_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659360092237/609022_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659360092237/609022_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-01-1659360092237/609024_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-01-1659360092237/609024_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-63-263-8680](tel:+82632638680)\n- [üè†www.foresttrip.go.kr](https://www.foresttrip.go.kr/indvz/main.do?hmpgId=ID02030025)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.9598381103\nlongitude: 127.2340169664\ntitle: 246, Gosanhyuyangnim-ro, Wanju-gun, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Taxi]<br>\nFrom Gosan Bus Terminal, take a taxi for approx. 5 min to Gosan Recreational Forest.\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-01-1659360092237","title":"Gosan Recreational Forest (Í≥†ÏÇ∞ÏûêÏó∞Ìú¥ÏñëÎ¶º)","description":"Located in Osan-ri, Gosan Recreational Forest is a popular family destination throughout all four seasons.

The valley is also befittingly named Baniram since it is so deep that it only receives direct sunlight for half the day. There are many strangely-shaped rocks like Jjokduri Rock, Cheollyeop Rock, and Daebul Rock scattered throughout the lush valley. At the peak of summer, the area is crowded with vacationers and is also popular for its autumn leaves.","regDate":"2023-01-10","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Valleys"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-10-1673332804228/219600_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-10-1673332804228"},{"id":"2023-01-10-1673328964294","title":"Uhwajeong Pavilion (Ïö∞ÌôîÏ†ï(ÎÇ¥Ïû•ÏÇ∞))","description":"Uhwajeong Pavilion takes its name from the legend that the pavilion once grew wings and ascended into the heavens.

Tapsa Temple is famous for the over 80 stone pagodas built by Lee Gapyong, a retired scholar. Those stone pagodas have different sizes and shapes from cone-shaped to straight-shaped. Behind Daeungjeon, Cheonjitap tower is located. It is the largest tower, with a x_height 3 times as high as the average adult‚Äôs x_height. How this tall tower was built is still unclear, drawing much attention from people. It is said that those stone pagodas were made in the late 1800s entirely by Lee Gapyong alone. He collected stones in daytime and built the pagodas at night. Even though the pagodas have been around for more than 100 years, they have never collapsed nor even moved through strong winds, making them truly amazing.<br>Tapsa Temple is also well known for cherry blossoms in spring, covering an area of 1.9km from Nambu (south) parking lot of Maisan Mountain to the entrance (a 30min walk). This road is the venue for Maisan Cherry Blossom Festival as well. <br><br>* Cheonjitap is comprised of two twin pagodas with x_heights of 13.5m and placed in the south and north directions. Cheonjitap is the main pagoda, making the other pagodas at Tapsa Temple look well-balanced. It is believed that 120 towers originally existed, but only 80 of them remain today. The two towers at the very front are named Ilgwangtap and Wolgwangtap. These groups of towers are strong enough to stand up to typhoon winds, something quite hard to believe, giving the towers a certain mystery. Also, towers are tilted slightly in both directions, showing that Lee Gapyong erected the towers with the direction of the wind in mind.","regDate":"2023-01-10","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-10-1673325568605/1605767_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-10-1673325568605"},{"id":"2023-01-10-1673321782101","title":"Taekwondowon Observatory (ÌÉúÍ∂åÎèÑÍ≥µÏõê Ï†ÑÎßùÎåÄ)","description":"Taekwondowon located in Muju-gun, Jeollabuk-do, serves as a main center for the 60 million taekwondo practitioners in 182 countries worldwide.

In the third year of King Chungsuk of Goryeo (1316), the temple saw the addition of a five-story stone pagoda, built by Monk Deokhyeon. At its peak, the temple was said to have had 12 hermitages and housed 1,000 monks. It was burned down during the Imjin War (1592-1598), leaving only the pagoda, but was rebuilt a few years later by Monk Soyo during the 37th year of King Seonjo (1604). Unfortunately, the temple was burned down again in the Korean War, but was once again restored to its original state in 1959. <br><br>Cultural assets found at the temple include Stone Guardian Post of Chungsin-ri & Namgye-ri, Sunchang Guesthouse, and the Three-story Stone Pagoda of Sunhwa-ri. Nearby tourist attractions include Geumseongsanseong Fortress, Yongsopokpo Falls, Gangcheonho Lake, Damyangho Lake, Chuwolsan Mountain, Huimunsan Mountain, and Naejangsan National Park.","regDate":"2023-01-09","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-09-1673256950962/1954560_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-09-1673256950962"},{"id":"2023-01-09-1673253606161","title":"Sono Belle Byeonsan Ocean Play (ÏÜåÎÖ∏Î≤® Î≥ÄÏÇ∞ Ïò§ÏÖòÌîåÎ†àÏù¥)","description":"Sono Belle Byeonsan Ocean Play is located next to Gyeokpo Beach on Byeonsan Peninsula.
