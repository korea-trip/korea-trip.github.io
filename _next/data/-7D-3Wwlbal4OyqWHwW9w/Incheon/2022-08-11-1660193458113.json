The island is mostly covered in trees and lacks manmade facilities. As a result, the island still has most of its natural environment, a gift of nature. In summer, the area around Gaemeori Hill is a popular camping site because of its beautiful view of the Milky Way at night.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-32-899-3710|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-11-1660193458113/2661885_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660193458113/2661885_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660193458113/2661886_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660193458113/2661886_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-11-1660193458113/2661887_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-11-1660193458113/2661887_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-32-899-3710](tel:+82328993710)\n- [üè†www.ongjin.go.kr](https://www.ongjin.go.kr/open_content/tour/information/island_guleop.jsp?cate1=deokjeok&cate2=09)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.1973520849\nlongitude: 125.9908073720\ntitle: Gureop-ri, Ongjin-gun, Incheon\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-11-1660193458113","title":"Gureopdo Island (Íµ¥ÏóÖÎèÑ)","description":"Gureopdo Island is considered the Galapagos of Korea.
