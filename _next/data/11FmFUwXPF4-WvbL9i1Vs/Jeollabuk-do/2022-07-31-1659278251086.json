The park is nestled in Deogyusan Mountain, Korea's 4th tallest mountain with the summit reaching an elevation of 1,614 meters. The mountain is blessed with a 36-kilometer valley dotted with several scenic points, ponds, and waterfalls. <br><br>\nThe mountain contains prestigious cultural heritages, such as Jeoksangsanseong Fortress (Historic Site No. 146) and the Hanging Painting of Anguksa Temple (Treasure No. 1267) to name a few. It is also home to diverse wildlife animals and plants. The mountain's beauty can be enjoyed all year round, with royal azaleas in spring, a colony of daylilies in summer, colorful autumn foliage in fall, and a white snowy mountain vista in winter.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|expagerange:|Elementary to high school students|\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-63-322-3174|\n|parking:|Available <Br>- Samgong Parking Lot, Jeoksang Parking Lot, Pahoe Parking Lot|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Open 24 hr|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Natural Preservation Areas (closed to public):|National Park Protected Areas<br>* San-6 Gongjeong-ri, Anseong-myeon, Muju-gun (until 2026)<br>* San-109 Samgong-ri, Seolcheon-myeon, Muju-gun (whole area, until 2026)<br>* San-6 Gongjeong-ri, Anseong-myeon, Muju-gun (until 2028)<br>* San-1 Samgeo-ri, Mupung-myeon, Muju-gun (until 2029)<br>* San-109 Samgong-ri, Seolcheon-myeon, Muju-gun (whole area except trails, until 2031)<br>* San-282 Weolseong-ri, Buksang-myeon, Geochang-gun, Gyeongsangnam-do (until 2032)<br>* San-177 Jukcheon-ri, Anseong-myeon, Muju-gun (until 2032)<br>* San-1 Deoksan-ri, Anseong-myeon, Muju-gun (until 2033)|\n|Mountain Not Access Period:|Seasonal Forest Fire Watches<br>Spring: March 1 ‚Äì April 30<br>Fall: November 15 ‚Äì December 15<br>* To be decided by park directors based on fire weather advisories, snow/precipitation levels, and other local conditions.|\n|Available Facilities:|Park Visitor's Information Center, shelters, campsites, cabin and caravan accommodations|\n|Facility Utilization Fees:|Accommodations (Medium):  Low season 5,000 won / Peak season 7,000 won<br />Accommodations (Large): Low season 7,000 won / Peak season 9,000 won<br />Auto-camping site: Low season 15,000 won / Peak season 19,000 won|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Compact cars 2,000 won<BR>Small to Mid-sized cars: Low season 4,000 won / Peak season 5,000 won<BR>Large-sized cars: Low season 6,000 won / Peak season 7,500 won|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-31-1659278251086/1246526_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659278251086/1246526_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659278251086/1246534_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659278251086/1246534_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659278251086/1246538_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659278251086/1246538_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659278251086/1246552_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659278251086/1246552_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659278251086/1246555_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659278251086/1246555_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659278251086/1246573_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659278251086/1246573_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659278251086/1246578_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659278251086/1246578_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659278251086/1246593_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659278251086/1246593_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659278251086/1246603_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659278251086/1246603_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659278251086/1246632_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659278251086/1246632_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-63-322-3174](tel:+82633223174)\n- [üè†deogyu.knps.or.kr](http://deogyu.knps.or.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.9007210596\nlongitude: 127.7751204501\ntitle: 159, Gucheondong 1-ro, Muju-gun, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-31-1659278251086","title":"Deogyusan National Park (Main, Jeoksang Section) (ÎçïÏú†ÏÇ∞Íµ≠Î¶ΩÍ≥µÏõê (Î≥∏ÏÜå,Ï†ÅÏÉÅÎ∂ÑÏÜå))","description":"The area of Deogyusan National Park stretches out from the southern ridges of Sobaeksan Mountain, covering regions within four different counties in Gyeongsangnam-do and Jeollabuk-do.

The land was purchased by French Priest Baudenet in 1891 (28th year of King Gojong), but construction of the church did not begin until 1908. The church was designed by Priest Poinel, who also designed the famous Myeongdong Cathedral in Seoul. Construction was completed in 1914, a time during which Korea was under Japanese rule. Though originally built just outside of Pungnammun Gate, the site of the martyrs, the church was later moved to its current location for expansion.  <br><br>The first Romanesque building in the Honam region, Jeondong Catholic Cathedral is made of gray and red bricks and bears a striking resemblance to the Myeongdong Cathedral in Seoul. Not only considered one of the most beautiful Catholic churches in Korea, some even go so far as to say it is one of the most beautiful structures in all of Korea, citing the church‚Äôs unique combination of Byzantine and Romanesque architectural styles. The rectangular building is topped with three Byzantine bell towers (to the right, center, and left) and boasts arched ceilings, several of which meet in the form of a cross. <br><br>It is interesting to note that some of the bricks used in construction of the church were made using materials from the Jeonjueupseong Walled Town, which was torn down by the Japanese. It is also said that the cornerstone of the church came from a wall of Jeonjueupseong Walled Town near Pungnammun Gate.","regDate":"2023-01-04","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Holy Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-04-1672810566980/2641989_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-04-1672810566980"},{"id":"2023-01-04-1672807110323","title":"Jeoksangsanseong Fortress (Î¨¥Ï£º Ï†ÅÏÉÅÏÇ∞ÏÑ±)","description":"Jeoksangsan Mountain (elevation 1,034m) in Muju, Jeollabuk-do, is surrounded by precipitous walls of stratified rocks.

And after Jeoksangsan became a designated site for storing Joseonwangjo Sillok (annals of the Joseon Dynasty), the fortress surrounding it was further rebuilt. The mountain is also home to Anguksa Temple, an ancient temple built in 1227 (during the 3rd year of King Chungryeol‚Äôs reign) by Monk Wolin. The mountain can easily be climbed by hiking or by vehicle; there is a paved road stretching over 15 kilometers that leads to the top of the mountain thanks to the construction of Muju Power Plant, letting tourists visit Sanjeong Lake and Anguksa Temple conveniently.","regDate":"2023-01-03","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-03-1672742201681/2719978_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-03-1672742201681"},{"id":"2023-01-03-1672738548256","title":"Jeokbyeokgang Cliffs [National Geopark] (Ï†ÅÎ≤ΩÍ∞ï (Ï†ÑÎ∂Å ÏÑúÌï¥Ïïà Íµ≠Í∞ÄÏßÄÏßàÍ≥µÏõê))","description":"The area around Jeokbyeokgang Cliffs features great plant distribution value, including a population of Machilus, a designated natural monument.

At the time of the survey it was discovered the tombs had already been illegally excavated, most likely during the reign of King Chungsukwang of the Goryeo dynasty. Though looters had stripped the tombs of any burial accessories, the wooden coffins were found to be relatively intact. <br><br>The coffins were severely damaged in the aftermath of the Korean War, but were later restored by the Jeonju National Museum. When they were first found, the twin tombs measured 3.1 meters high and 0.5 kilometers wide, but some of the original wood was lost during the tombs‚Äô tumultuous history and the restoration that followed. The larger of the restored tombs now measures 30 meters in diameter and 5 meters in x_height while the smaller tomb measures 24 meters in diameter and 3.5 meters in x_height. On January 21, 1963 the tombs were designated Historic Site No. 87. <br><br>The Twin Tombs are roughly 200 meters apart, with the tomb in the east called Daewangmyo (big royal tomb) and the one in the west Sowangmyo (small royal tomb). The interiors of the tombs are done in the same style as the stone chamber tombs found in the tomb cluster of Neungsan-ri, Buyeo. Considering that the nearby Mireuksaji Temple Site was built during the reign of King Mu of Baekje dynasty, it is highly likely that the Twin Tombs are those of King Mu and his wife, Queen Seonhwa.","regDate":"2023-01-03","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-03-1672731345521/1308535_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-03-1672731345521"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
