A stone sculpture and a statue of Granny Samsin (a goddess that looks after babies’ births and keeps them healthy) also stand at the temple. However, the temple’s most treasured assets are its two Natural Monuments: Emerald Gaiety (a climbing vine, Natural Monument No. 380) and the Cheongsil Pear Tree (Natural Monument No. 386). Reverse icicles, though found all over the mountainsides, are most readily and abundantly found in the Eunsusa Temple area.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-63-433-2502|\n|parking:|Maisan Provincial Park Parking Lot|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|[Cultural Assets (Maisan Tapgun & Geumdangsa)]<br>Individuals - Adults 3,000 won / Teenagers 2,000 won / Children 1,000 won<br />Groups - Adults 2,800 won / Teenagers 1,600 won / Children 800 won<br /<br><br>* Group: 30 or more people|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Not available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-31-1659303488502/1605747_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659303488502/1605747_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659303488502/1605748_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659303488502/1605748_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659303488502/1605749_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659303488502/1605749_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659303488502/1605750_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659303488502/1605750_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659303488502/1605751_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659303488502/1605751_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-31-1659303488502/1605753_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-31-1659303488502/1605753_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-63-433-2502](tel:+82634332502)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.7594668368\nlongitude: 127.4144950983\ntitle: 406, Maisannam-ro, Jinan-gun, Jeollabuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Jeonju Intercity Bus Terminal, take an intercity bus to Jinan Bus Terminal. <br>\nFrom Jinan Bus Terminal, take a bus bound for Maisan.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-31-1659303488502","title":"Eunsusa Temple (은수사)","description":"The temple located upon Maisan Mountain was called Sangwonsa Temple during the early Joseon dynasty and was later known as Jeongmyeongam Hermitage.

The land was purchased by French Priest Baudenet in 1891 (28th year of King Gojong), but construction of the church did not begin until 1908. The church was designed by Priest Poinel, who also designed the famous Myeongdong Cathedral in Seoul. Construction was completed in 1914, a time during which Korea was under Japanese rule. Though originally built just outside of Pungnammun Gate, the site of the martyrs, the church was later moved to its current location for expansion.  <br><br>The first Romanesque building in the Honam region, Jeondong Catholic Cathedral is made of gray and red bricks and bears a striking resemblance to the Myeongdong Cathedral in Seoul. Not only considered one of the most beautiful Catholic churches in Korea, some even go so far as to say it is one of the most beautiful structures in all of Korea, citing the church’s unique combination of Byzantine and Romanesque architectural styles. The rectangular building is topped with three Byzantine bell towers (to the right, center, and left) and boasts arched ceilings, several of which meet in the form of a cross. <br><br>It is interesting to note that some of the bricks used in construction of the church were made using materials from the Jeonjueupseong Walled Town, which was torn down by the Japanese. It is also said that the cornerstone of the church came from a wall of Jeonjueupseong Walled Town near Pungnammun Gate.","regDate":"2023-01-04","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Holy Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-04-1672810566980/2641989_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-04-1672810566980"},{"id":"2023-01-04-1672807110323","title":"Jeoksangsanseong Fortress (무주 적상산성)","description":"Jeoksangsan Mountain (elevation 1,034m) in Muju, Jeollabuk-do, is surrounded by precipitous walls of stratified rocks.

Jeoksangsan, also called Red Skirt Mountain, got its name from the view of red maple trees around cliffs in fall that makes the mountain look like a giant red skirt. The mountain boasts a variety of attractions from Hyangnobong Peak (1,029 meters), Cheonilpokpo Falls, Songdaepokpo Falls, Jangdobawi Rock, Janggunbawi Rock, and Allyeomdae Cliff.<br><br>The rugged shape of the mountain was considered ideal for building a fortress. And after Jeoksangsan became a designated site for storing Joseonwangjo Sillok (annals of the Joseon Dynasty), the fortress surrounding it was further rebuilt. The mountain is also home to Anguksa Temple, an ancient temple built in 1227 (during the 3rd year of King Chungryeol’s reign) by Monk Wolin. The mountain can easily be climbed by hiking or by vehicle; there is a paved road stretching over 15 kilometers that leads to the top of the mountain thanks to the construction of Muju Power Plant, letting tourists visit Sanjeong Lake and Anguksa Temple conveniently.","regDate":"2023-01-03","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-03-1672742201681/2719978_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-03-1672742201681"},{"id":"2023-01-03-1672738548256","title":"Jeokbyeokgang Cliffs [National Geopark] (적벽강 (전북 서해안 국가지질공원))","description":"The area around Jeokbyeokgang Cliffs features great plant distribution value, including a population of Machilus, a designated natural monument.

At the time of the survey it was discovered the tombs had already been illegally excavated, most likely during the reign of King Chungsukwang of the Goryeo dynasty. Though looters had stripped the tombs of any burial accessories, the wooden coffins were found to be relatively intact. <br><br>The coffins were severely damaged in the aftermath of the Korean War, but were later restored by the Jeonju National Museum. When they were first found, the twin tombs measured 3.1 meters high and 0.5 kilometers wide, but some of the original wood was lost during the tombs’ tumultuous history and the restoration that followed. The larger of the restored tombs now measures 30 meters in diameter and 5 meters in x_height while the smaller tomb measures 24 meters in diameter and 3.5 meters in x_height. On January 21, 1963 the tombs were designated Historic Site No. 87. <br><br>The Twin Tombs are roughly 200 meters apart, with the tomb in the east called Daewangmyo (big royal tomb) and the one in the west Sowangmyo (small royal tomb). The interiors of the tombs are done in the same style as the stone chamber tombs found in the tomb cluster of Neungsan-ri, Buyeo. Considering that the nearby Mireuksaji Temple Site was built during the reign of King Mu of Baekje dynasty, it is highly likely that the Twin Tombs are those of King Mu and his wife, Queen Seonhwa.","regDate":"2023-01-03","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeollabuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-01-03-1672731345521/1308535_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeollabuk-do/2023-01-03-1672731345521"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
