Bomunsan Mountain is located in the southern part of the city and was once called \"Bomulsan\" meaning \"treasure mountain\" because it was believed that treasure was buried in the mountain. Bomunsan Mountain was designated as a park in 1965. There are many mineral springs and the azaleas and cherry blossoms that bloom in spring. In autumn, the leaves change to a beautiful color in the maple forest. This park has the Bomunsanseong Fortress and Bomunsa Temple Site, an outdoor music hall, an observatory, amusement facilities, a cable car, and about 10 hiking trails, making it a great place to exercise. There are also recreational facilities such as mountain climbing as well as leisure facilities including an indoor roller skating rink in Sajeong Park, soccer field, outdoor music hall, Greenland, and Youth Square. <br><Br>The Bomunsan Forest Trail is a 13-kilometer walking trail that circles Bomunsan Mountain. The dense forest along the trail creats a cool shade to walk under and boasts beautiful fall foliage in autumn.","regDate":"2022-07-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Daejeon","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-12-1657626849586/2675750_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Daejeon/2022-07-12-1657626849586"}],"metaData":{"pageUrl":"https://mcdryad.com/Daejeon","nav":"Daejeon"},"navList":["Daejeon","Incheon","Seoul"]},"__N_SSG":true}
