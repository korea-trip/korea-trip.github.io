This site was originally the location of Garyangsa Temple, which was constructed in 854, during the 16th year of King Munseong of the Silla Kingdom. The temple was very famous as it was surrounded by beautiful mountains and crystal clear waters. However, the temple was destroyed by fire during the Manchu War of 1636.<br><br>\nDuring the Joseon dynasty, King Jeongjo moved the tomb of his father to this spot, and built Yongjusa Temple here to pray for the repose of his father‚Äôs soul. It is said that one night before the temple was completed, King Jeongjo dreamt of a dragon ascending to the sky holding a magic ball in its mouth. He therefore named the temple ‚ÄúYongjusa,‚Äù which means the temple of a dragon with a magic ball in Korean.\n<br><br>\nThe courtyard of the temple contains the Bronze Bell of Yongjusa Temple, a National Treasure; a stone pagoda; Daeungbojeon (the main hall); and Cheonboru Pavilion. Visitors to Yongjusa Temple can also find the ‚ÄúBumoeunjunggyeong‚Äù books, which were written by King Jeongjo on the subject of filial affection and respect for one‚Äôs parents. These days, Yongjusa Temple and the Yungneung and Geolleung Royal Tombs are highly valued for their cultural heritage.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-31-234-0040|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|[Filial Piety Museum] Closed on Mondays|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 1,500 won / Teenagers 1,000 won / Children 700 won<br>Groups - Adults 1,300 won / Teenagers 800 won / Children 500 won|\n|Available Facilities:|Filial Piety Museum|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-27-1661585850373/1593648_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-27-1661585850373/1593648_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-27-1661585850373/1593649_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-27-1661585850373/1593649_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-27-1661585850373/1593651_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-27-1661585850373/1593651_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-27-1661585850373/1593652_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-27-1661585850373/1593652_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-27-1661585850373/1593653_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-27-1661585850373/1593653_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-27-1661585850373/1593654_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-27-1661585850373/1593654_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-27-1661585850373/1593655_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-27-1661585850373/1593655_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-31-234-0040](tel:+82312340040)\n- [üè†www.yongjoosa.or.kr](http://www.yongjoosa.or.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.2121374903\nlongitude: 127.0050980005\ntitle: 136, Yongju-ro, Hwaseong-si, Gyeonggi-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-27-1661585850373","title":"Hwaseong Yongjusa Temple (Ïö©Ï£ºÏÇ¨(ÌôîÏÑ±))","description":"Yongjusa Temple is located near Yungneung and Geolleung Royal Tombs.
