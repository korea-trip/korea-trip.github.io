The village was formed by refugees of the Korean War from North Korea, mainly from Hamgyeong-do Province. The word ‚Äúabai‚Äù is a dialect of Hamgyeong-do that means a friendly old man like a grandfather. Visitors to Abai Village can get a sense of displaced people‚Äôs life and story, which fade away into a chapter of history. Although it has lost its original appearance now, old shacks without a gate still remain here and there. Mural paintings on the wall show the sentiment of nostalgia about their hometown and express sorrow and hard life of displaced people, who lived from hand to mouth by fishing and doing physical labor. The original houses built by refugees in the village were restored into the Refugee Village at the Sokcho Museum. Abai Village is also known as a filming location for the Korean TV drama Autumn in My Heart, attracting a lot of visitors and becoming a major attraction in Sokcho. The restaurant alley is packed with cafes and North Korean food restaurants serving local dishes such as Hamheung-style cold buckwheat noodles, stuffed squid, and North Korean-style sausage soup.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|expagerange:|Open to visitors of all ages|\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-33-639-2690|\n|parking:|Available (50 spaces)|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Open 24 hr|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Film Locations:|KBS drama \"Autumn in My Heart (2000)\"|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Available Facilities:|Abai Village, Abai Village Ferry|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Not available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-24-1658634210481/2657595_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658634210481/2657595_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658634210481/2657596_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658634210481/2657596_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658634210481/2657597_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658634210481/2657597_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658634210481/2657600_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658634210481/2657600_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658634210481/2657601_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658634210481/2657601_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658634210481/2711174_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658634210481/2711174_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658634210481/2711175_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658634210481/2711175_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658634210481/2711176_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658634210481/2711176_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658634210481/2711177_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658634210481/2711177_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-33-639-2690](tel:+82336392690)\n- [üè†www.abai.co.kr](http://www.abai.co.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 38.2007412589\nlongitude: 128.5949161776\ntitle: 122-1, Cheongho-ro, Sokcho-si, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>\nFrom Seoul Express Bus Terminal or Dong Seoul Bus Terminal, take a bus to Sokcho Bus Terminal.<BR>\nFrom Sokcho Express Bus Terminal Bus Stop, take Bus No. 1, 7, or 9  or from Sokcho Intercity Bus Terminal Bus Stop, take Bus No. 7-1 or 9-1 and get off at City Hall Bus Stop.<BR>\nWalk for approx. 5 min and take a boat to Cheongho-dong.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-24-1658634210481","title":"Abai Village (ÏïÑÎ∞îÏù¥ ÎßàÏùÑ)","description":"Located in Cheongho-dong, Abai Village bears a history of displaced people‚Äôs distress.

Its name reflects its dedication to the value of rest by freedom from the troubles of mundane life. The temple was built in 1997 by the monk Hongbeop as a small Buddha hall named Myojeokjeon Hall, but the discovery of a large rock shaped like a reclining Avalokiteshvara in 1999 made the temple a popular site for prayers. A large rock named Yeonhwadae, named after its shape of a lotus flower in bloom, is located below the Myojeokjeon Hall near the sea. Yeonhwadae is a great place to see the reclining Avalokiteshvara and turtle-shaped rock in the area, and many other tourists flock to see the interesting rock formations of the area, like toe rocks, foot rock, and fist rock. Lucky visitors can catch a glimpse of schools of big-scaled redfin surfacing to feed at the beach. Hyuhyuam Hermitage is also home to Myojeokjeon Hall, Darani Cave Buddha Hall, Gwaneum Buddhist Bell, and a statue of the Avalokiteshvara. The Avalokiteshvara statue, in particular, enjoys great popularity from its hilltop vantage point, having the blue seas of the East Sea to its back.","regDate":"2022-09-23","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-23-1663914439662/2711354_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-09-23-1663914439662"},{"id":"2022-09-23-1663909574042","title":"Gangneung Gyeongpo Beach (Í∞ïÎ¶â Í≤ΩÌè¨ÏàòÏöïÏû•)","description":"Located 1 kilometer away from Gyeongpodae Pavilion and 6 kilometers from downtown Gangneung, Gyeongpo Beach is a sand bank formed between Gyeongpoho Lake and the ocean.
