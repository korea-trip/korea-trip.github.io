Along Gangneung's most famous food street the beans are ground for Chodang dubu, then through several steps, salt water from the East Sea is used in the congealing process resulting in a soft and light tofu.  The name of this village, Chodang, originates from the name of a famous family that once lived here known as Chodang-Heoyeop.  Heoyeop was the father of son, writer/poet Heo-gyun [1569~1618] and daughter, poet Heonan-seolheon [1563~1589].  A traditional-style Korean house has been reconstructed on the site where the original house of Heo-gyun and Heonan-seolheon once stood.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(English, Korean, Japanese, Chinese)<br>• For more info: +82-33-640-4414|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-25-1658741907055/1022426_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658741907055/1022426_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658741907055/203503_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658741907055/203503_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658741907055/2365224_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658741907055/2365224_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658741907055/2365225_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658741907055/2365225_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658741907055/2365226_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658741907055/2365226_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658741907055/2365227_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658741907055/2365227_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658741907055/2365228_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658741907055/2365228_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-25-1658741907055/551894_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-25-1658741907055/551894_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-33-640-4414](tel:+82336404414)\n- [🏠gnchodangdubu.modoo.at](http://gnchodangdubu.modoo.at)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.7931115115\nlongitude: 128.9170802756\ntitle: 99, Chodangsundubu-gil, Gangneung-si, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n<b>Bus<br></b> From Gangneung Intercity Bus Terminal, take bus  206,  207 or 230.

Walking up along the wooden deck trail among the bamboo grove leads you to the observatory, which offers an open view of the deep blue East Sea, the Cheongchoho Lake, which is home to migratory birds, and the magnificent scenery of Seoraksan Mountain. Viewed from the high tower, the East Sea unfolds its boundless ocean and sometimes it looks like a calm lake but can become an energetic ocean full of vitality. Built in 1957, Sokcho Lighthouse still lights up for ships at night. The bright light and sound of the beacon, which has been in service since the lighthouse’s establishment, can show the waterway to a boat, which is about 35 km away from the lighthouse. Right next to the observatory, Yeonggeumjeong Pavilion is situated.","regDate":"2022-10-13","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-10-13-1665647612612/2711170_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-10-13-1665647612612"},{"id":"2022-10-13-1665645019170","title":"Sokcho Expo Tower (속초 엑스포타워)","description":"Sokcho Expo Tower in the area of Cheongchoho Lake, Joyang-dong, is an observatory tower set in a park surrounded by mountains and lakes. <br><br>The tower is 73.4m in x_height and can accommodate up to 100 visitors at once.
