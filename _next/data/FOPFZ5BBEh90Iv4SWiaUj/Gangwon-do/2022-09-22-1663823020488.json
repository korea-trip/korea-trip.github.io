Osaek (meaning ‚Äúfive colors‚Äù) was inspired by the five colors of Jujeongol‚Äôs rock formations, and the five-colored tree that is said to have lived in Osaekseoksa Temple of the past. A 3.2 km-long trail brings visitors along the rising rocks next to the valley, connecting Seongguksa Temple and Seonnyeotang Pothole to Yongso Falls Information Center. It is a relatively flat, 1 hr-long course with many wooden decks that help to make it more accessible for the visitors. The entrance to the trail is the location of the Osaek Mineral Spring, whose natural carbonation and iron content impart a unique flavor in the water.
