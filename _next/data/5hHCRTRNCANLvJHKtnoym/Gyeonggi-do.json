The mountain is where North and South Korea engaged in a fierce battle at the end of the Korean War; after the battle, Korea was divided into two nations. Since the peak is still a restricted area, visitors must present their passport in order to be admitted. From the peak, an open view of North Korean territory unfolds below and visitors can see South Korean territory as far as Songhaksan Mountain in Chungcheongnam-do.","regDate":"2022-07-18","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-18-1658097670373/1855979_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-07-18-1658097670373","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Gyeonggi-do/2022-07-18-1658097670373"},{"id":"2022-07-17-1658097788788","title":"Ansan Botanical Garden (안산식물원)","description":"Opened in 2001, the Ansan Botanical Garden has three halls.
