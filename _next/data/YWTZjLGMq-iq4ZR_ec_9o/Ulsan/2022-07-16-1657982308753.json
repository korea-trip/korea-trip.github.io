Cape Ganjeolgot is in the spotlight as a new tourist attraction along with Jinha Beach and Seosaengpo Japanese Fortress. The lighthouse is located 20 minutes away from the entrance to Ulsan Nambu Beltway. When acacias bloom along the coast from Ulsan to Haeundae Beach in Busan, the road is filled with its subtle perfume.

Enjoy the tremendous scenery of the invigorating sea and the misty view of the hills. Although it is only 20 minutes away from Ulsan Nambu Beltway, the scenic beauty contributes to the exotic look.","regDate":"2022-07-16","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Ulsan","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-16-1657953961681/2648694_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Ulsan/2022-07-16-1657953961681","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Ulsan/2022-07-16-1657953961681"},{"id":"2022-07-16-1657949924623","title":"Gangdong Pebble Beach (강동몽돌해변)","description":"For those hoping for a view of the winter sea, or those longing for the engulfing embrace of the clear dark-blue waves crashing into huge rocks, Gangdong Pebble Beach is the place to be.
