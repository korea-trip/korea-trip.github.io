Gaeseong, Suwon, Ganghwa and Gwangju are located in the north, south, west, and east direction respectively. Namhansanseong Fortress is located to the east in Gwangju. The park is situated on Namhansan Mountain, 24km southeast from Seoul and 6km northeast from Seongnam. The length of trails is a total of approximately 12.4 km (main fortress 8.9km, external fortress 3.2km, Sinnamsanseong Fortress 0.2km). The x_height is 7.3m.<br><br>\nThe fortress is alternately recorded as being the royal fortress of King Onjo of the Baekje Kingdom, whose father was King Dongmyeong during Goguryeo period or a fortress built in 673 during the reign of King Munmu (the 13th year) of Silla period during the heat of the Silla and Tang War. The old site was rebuilt several times, with its current style of construction being built in 1621 during King Gwanghae’s reign. <br><br> Namhansanseong’s circumference is approximately 12km, stacking small natural stones over big stones. The fortress includes Sueocheong (Namhansan Mountain Fortress Defense Command), Gwana (government office), storage, and a haenggung (temporary palace), as well as 80 wells and 45 springs. Also, administration was moved from Gwangju-eup to inside of the fortress, clearly showing the importance of Namhansanseong Fortress in that period. 12,700 people participated in a field exercise carried out for the first time after building the fortress by command of King Injo (17th year, 1639). These days, only a few buildings remain inside of the fortress including East and South Gate, Seojangdae, Hyeonjeolsa Temple, Yeonmu Hall, Janggyeongsa Temple, Jisudang, Yeongwoljeong, and Chimgwaejeong. Among these remaining buildings, four gates, Sueojangdae, and some parts of the fortress in the middle of West Gate still maintain their original forms. Namhansanseong Fortress is designated as Historical Site No. 57 and a provincial park.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-31-746-1088|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|Mondays|\n|usetime:|[Namhansanseong Haenggung]<br>April-October 10:00-18:00<br>November-March 10:00-17:00<br><br>* Last admission 30 minutes before closing.|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Hiking Course:|[Course 1] Sanseong Rotary – North Gate – West Gate – Sueojangdae – Yeongchunjeong – South Gate – Sanseong Rotary<br>[Course 2 ] Sangseong Rotary – Yeongwoljeong – Sungyeoljeon – West Gate – Sueojangdae – Sanseong Rotary <br>[Course 3 ] Namhansanseong Fortress UNESCO Heritage Center – Hyeonjeolsa Temple – Beolbong Peak  – Janggyeongsa Temple – Mangwolsa Temple – East Gate – Namhansanseong Fortress UNESCO Heritage Center<br>[Course 4] Sanseong Rotary – South Gate – Namjangdaeteo – East Gate – Jisudang Altar – Gaewonsa Temple – Sanseong Rotary<br>[Course 5] Namhansanseong Fortress UNESCO Heritage Center – East Gate – Dongjangdaeteo – North Gate – West Gate – Sueojangdae – Yeongchunjeong – South Gate – East Gate - Namhansanseong Fortress UNESCO Heritage Center|\n|Mountain Not Access Period:|Seasonal Forest Fire Watch<br>February 1-May 15, November 1-December 15<br><br>* TBD by park directors based on fire weather advisories, snow/precipitation levels, and other local conditions.|\n|Parking Fees:|Two-wheel vehicles: 500 won / Cars 1,000 won <BR>Buses: Under 12 seats 1,000 won / Over 12 seats 2,000 won<BR>Trucks: Under 4.5 ton 1,000 won / Over 4.5 ton 2,000 won|\n|Admission Fees:|[Namhansanseong Provincial Park]<br>Free<br><br> [Namhansanseong Haenggung] <br> Individual: Adults 2,000 won / Children 1,000 won <br> Group: Adults 1,600 won / Children 800 won<br> <br> * Group: 30 people or more<br> * Adults (ages 19-64), Children (ages 7-18)<br> * Free (ID required): Senior citizens (ages 65 & over)|\n|Available Facilities:|Benches, water supply systems, restrooms, cultural relics, Namhansanseong Fortress History Museum, memorial site, valley, etc.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|* Reservation: Namhansanseong Fortress Visitor's Center +82-31-745-2845<br>* Available languages: English, Japanese, Chinese|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-09-01-1662018070165/1589317_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-01-1662018070165/1589317_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-01-1662018070165/1589318_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-01-1662018070165/1589318_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-01-1662018070165/1589320_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-01-1662018070165/1589320_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-01-1662018070165/2612850_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-01-1662018070165/2612850_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-01-1662018070165/2612851_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-01-1662018070165/2612851_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-01-1662018070165/2612852_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-01-1662018070165/2612852_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-01-1662018070165/2612855_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-01-1662018070165/2612855_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-01-1662018070165/2612857_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-01-1662018070165/2612857_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-01-1662018070165/2652509_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-01-1662018070165/2652509_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-01-1662018070165/2612853_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-01-1662018070165/2612853_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-31-746-1088](tel:+82317461088)\n- [🏠www.gg.go.kr](http://www.gg.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.4766684605\nlongitude: 127.1883850251\ntitle: 731, Namhansanseong-ro, Gwangju-si, Gyeonggi-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway]<br>\nSanseong Station (Seoul Subway Line 8), Exit 2.<br>Take Bus No. 9 and get off at Namhansanseong Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-09-01-1662018070165","title":"Namhansanseong Provincial Park [UNESCO World Heritage] (남한산성도립공원 [유네스코 세계문화유산])","description":"Namhansanseong Provincial Park surrounds Namhansanseong Fortress, one of four forts built to protect Hanyang (the former name of Seoul).

This was the first joint royal tomb of the Joseon dynasty.<br><br> King Sejong was the third son of the third ruler, King Taejong, and his wife Queen Wongyeong. He came to the throne at the age of 22. During his 32-year reign, he was very influential in the development of Korean culture. For example, King Sejong created the Korean alphabet, which he called Hunminjeongeum, and set up the Hall of Worthies (Jiphyeonjeon), an association of the kingdom’s brightest scholars. He also used Confucian principles to administer state affairs. Under the reign of King Sejong, therefore, many sectors including politics, economy, society and culture flourished. In fact, King Sejong the Great is regarded as making some of the most brilliant achievements in Korean history. <br><br> Yeongneung is currently located in Neungseo-myeon in Yeoju-si in Gyeonggi-do, but the tomb was originally located in Seogang, Gwangju. When it was constructed following Queen Soheon’s death in 1446, it was decided it should be a joint tomb, and the space on the right side was reserved for King Sejong. In 1450 when King Sejong died, he was buried together with the dead queen. Later, the tomb was moved to its current place, as it was thought that the original location was not an auspicious place according to geomantic traditions.<br><br> Various items that were originally buried in the tomb were excavated in 1973 and now are exhibited in the King Sejong the Great Memorial Hall, which is located in Cheongnyangni, Seoul. <br><br> Nyeongneung is the royal tomb of the 17th ruler of the Joseon dynasty, King Hyojong (1619-1659, reign 1649-1659), and of his wife Queen Inseon (1618-1674).<br><br> The tomb was originally located to the west of Geonwolleung (the tomb of King Taejo, the first ruler of the Joseon dynasty), but in 1673 cracks appeared on the tomb’s “Byeongpungseok” (stone border), and it was moved to its current location, which is to the east of Yeongneung (the tomb of King Sejong).<br><br> King Hyojong was the second son of King Injo, Joseon dynasty’s 16th ruler, and Queen Illyeol. Upon ascending to the throne, he devised a plan to conquer the northern region of Asia, including the Qing dynasty (part of China). As part of the plan, he reformed the military system and strengthened the army and military enforcements. King Hyojong had spent time in northern China when he was taken hostage by the Manchus. During that time he became exposed to many different cultures and technological advancements. When a group of Dutch sailors were shipwrecked on the Korean shore, King Hyojong ordered them to build the Korean army’s first muskets. <br><br> King Hyojong also implemented “Daedongbeop,” a tax system under which people had to pay taxes with rice, and circulated “Sangpyeongtongbo,” the coinage of the Joseon dynasty.","regDate":"2022-09-20","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-20-1663660086765/2482766_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-09-20-1663660086765"},{"id":"2022-09-20-1663655587484","title":"Yeoju Silleuksa Temple (신륵사 (여주))","description":"Silleuksa Temple is located along the upper section of the Namhangang River as it flows from Bongmisan Mountain in Yeoju.
