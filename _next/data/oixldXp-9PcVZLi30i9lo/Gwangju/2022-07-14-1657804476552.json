The Jusangjeolli cliffs of Mudeungsan Mountain consist of Seoseokdae, Ipseokdae, and Gyubong Rocks formed about 70 million years ago. Ipseokdae and Gyubong Rocks are both of a distinct pillar shape as they have been heavily weathered, and Seoseokdae, which was less weathered, looks like a folding screen. The Neodeolgeong (cluster of rocks), which sit on the mountain slope, were made when stone pillars collapsed. The standing rocks and Neodolgeong have been designated as Natural Monuments due to their rarity and uniqueness.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-62-227-1187|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Available Facilities:|Cheongpum Rest Area|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|[For detail info](http://mudeungsan.gwangju.go.kr/contents.do?S=S21&M=010500000000)|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-14-1657804476552/1558929_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-14-1657804476552/1558929_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-14-1657804476552/1558930_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-14-1657804476552/1558930_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-14-1657804476552/1558932_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-14-1657804476552/1558932_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-14-1657804476552/1558935_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-14-1657804476552/1558935_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-14-1657804476552/1558936_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-14-1657804476552/1558936_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-14-1657804476552/1558940_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-14-1657804476552/1558940_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-14-1657804476552/1558941_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-14-1657804476552/1558941_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-14-1657804476552/1558945_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-14-1657804476552/1558945_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-14-1657804476552/1558949_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-14-1657804476552/1558949_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-14-1657804476552/1558950_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-14-1657804476552/1558950_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-62-227-1187](tel:+82622271187)\n- [üè†mudeung.knps.or.kr</a> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br /><a href=\"http://www.cha.go.kr/\" target=\"_blank\">www.cha.go.kr](http://mudeung.knps.or.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.1200598333\nlongitude: 126.9989650099\ntitle: San 354-1, Yongyeon-dong, Dong-gu, Gwangju\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>\nFrom Gwangju Bus Terminal (U-Square) Bus Stop, take Bus No. 09 and get off at the Entrance of Jeungsimsa Temple Bus Stop. <br>\nWalk towards Mudeungsan Provincial Park.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-14-1657804476552","title":"Jusangjeolli Cliff of Mudeungsan Mountain (Î¨¥Îì±ÏÇ∞ Ï£ºÏÉÅÏ†àÎ¶¨ÎåÄ)","description":"The Jueangjeolli cliffs are rock pillars of various hexagonal shapes that seem as if they were hand carved.

Owen had hoped to build a memorial hospital in honor of his grandfather, but died before his plan was materialized. The plaque hanging in the hall honors both men in English and Chinese, reading, ‚ÄúIn Memory of William L. and Clement C.

Known as the oldest surviving Western-style house in Gwangju, the house is an icon of modern culture and architecture in Korea. The house was built by an American missionary named Wilson in the 1920s (exact date unknown) and was the home of the Wilson family while they stayed in Korea. When the family completed their work in Korea, they sold the house for a very cheap price with the stipulation that the house continued to be used for missionary purposes. The house fell into the possession of the General Assembly of Chonnam Presbyterian Church of Korea in 1986 and now serves as the home office for the Presbyterian Church of Korea. <br><br>The square-shaped house consists of a living room, a family room, a kitchen, and a bathroom (1F), several bedrooms (2F), and storage areas and a boiler room (B1). The fact that the entrance of the house faces east is said to be a result of the prevailing architectural culture of Korea at that time. A Netherland-style house built with 55-milimeter thick, gray bricks, the first and second stories are delineated on the exterior with an eye-catching band of bricks.","regDate":"2022-07-14","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gwangju","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Old Houses"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-14-1657818014893/2493617_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gwangju/2022-07-14-1657818014893"},{"id":"2022-07-14-1657813318676","title":"May 18th National Cemetery (Íµ≠Î¶Ω 5.18 ÎØºÏ£ºÎ¨òÏßÄ)","description":"The May 18th National Cemetery in Gwangju is a symbol of freedom and democracy.
