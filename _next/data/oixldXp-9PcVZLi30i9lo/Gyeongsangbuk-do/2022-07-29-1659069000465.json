During the Goryeo dynasty, the temple was referred to Seondalsa Temple or Heunggyosa Temple. During excavation work in 1916, records of the temple's repair work were discovered. According to these findings, it was learned that Muryangsujeon Hall and other buildings were rebuilt in the early part of the Goryeo dynasty. The hall burned down during war in 1358, and was later rebuilt in 1376.

Some of the most unique of these outcroppings are black and white stripes like that of a zebra, and eye structures. The striped structures were formed when the white and black components of the rock were separated by high heat and then pressed together under strong pressure. The eye-shaped structures were made by the white components combining.","regDate":"2022-07-29","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Valleys"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-29-1659100524331/183272_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-07-29-1659100524331"},{"id":"2022-07-29-1659094611502","title":"Bunhwangsa Temple (Î∂ÑÌô©ÏÇ¨)","description":"Bunhwangsa Temple is located next to Hwangnyongsa Temple Site in Gyeongju, and is famous for Stone Brick Pagoda, National Treasure No. 30.
