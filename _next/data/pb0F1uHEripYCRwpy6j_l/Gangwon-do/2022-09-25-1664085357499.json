Located on the eastern outskirts of downtown Chuncheon, Gubongsan Mountain (441 m) with nine peaks, commands a panoramic view of the city. When the road passing halfway up the mountain was opened in the 1990s, many cafes and restaurants were established and became Chuncheon’s representative cafe street. All the cafes here have glass windows or outdoor terraces in order to offer the best scenic view for customers. Each cafe has its own characteristic feature  a building that recalls Santorini in Greece, the skywalk observatory decorated with transparent glass in all directions, and distinctive photo zones. The service area, which sells canned coffee and banquet noodles, is also situated among stylish coffee shops. Visitors will enjoy its fantastic scenic views from day to night, including the sunny scenery, the beautiful sunset, and the nighttime view of the Soyang i(2)gyo Bridge.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-33-250-4312|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|Open year round|\n|usetime:|00:00–24:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Observatory service area, cafe, and restaurant|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Free of charge|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-09-25-1664085357499/1804421_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664085357499/1804421_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664085357499/1804423_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664085357499/1804423_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664085357499/1804426_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664085357499/1804426_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664085357499/1804494_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664085357499/1804494_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664085357499/1988569_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664085357499/1988569_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664085357499/1988571_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664085357499/1988571_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664085357499/1988572_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664085357499/1988572_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664085357499/2622268_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664085357499/2622268_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664085357499/2622269_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664085357499/2622269_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-25-1664085357499/1804483_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-25-1664085357499/1804483_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-33-250-4312](tel:+82332504312)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.8928170392\nlongitude: 127.7766999636\ntitle: 1154-113, Sunhwan-daero, Dong-myeon, Chuncheon-si, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway + Taxi]<br>\nNamchuncheon Station (Seoul Subway Gyeongchun Line).<br>\nFrom the station, take a taxi for approx. 20 min.\n","data":{"id":"2022-09-25-1664085357499","title":"Gubongsan Observatory Cafe Street (구봉산 전망대 카페거리)","description":"Gubongsan Observatory Cafe Street is a well-known scenic spot for its beautiful landscape of Chuncheon with the background of mountains, lake, and river.

Their powerful water streams pouring into the narrow and rough valley look like a legendary dragon. There is another tale associated with Biryongpokpo Falls. A dragon lived here, and one day villagers offered a maiden to the dragon to break the drought. Then, the dragon flew up to the sky, and there were no more droughts in the village. The waterfalls drop 16 m to the ground and their loud sound resonates in the valley. In winter, the waterfalls freeze and the frozen water columns offer another magnificent view. A clear pond is formed beneath the falls and around which there is a wooden observation deck. Biryongpokpo Falls and Surroundings in Seoraksan Mountain were designated as the Scenic Site No. 95.
