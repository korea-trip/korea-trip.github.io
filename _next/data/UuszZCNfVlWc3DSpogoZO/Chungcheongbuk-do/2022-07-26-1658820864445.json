Mrs. Yuk Young-soo was born from  the house and raised, \nuntil to later stage the establishment&nbsp;to fall in disrepair. Luckily, the building was restored in May of 2011, \nand it became open to the public. The house was originally built in the 1600s by Kim Jeongseung, and subsequently lived in by  Song Jeongseung, and then Min Jeongseung, gaining the house the nickname of \"Samjeongseong House,\" meaning the house of three Jeongseong's. \n(The Jeongseong's rank is similiar to that of prime minister's today.)<br><br>\nBefore Mrs. Yuk Young-soo was born, the house was bought in 1918 from the sons of Min Jeongseung by Yuk Jong-gwan, and then repaired in the likeness of a typical Chungcheong <i>yangban</i> (noble \nclass) house from the late Joseon period. After entering through the main gate, the large site features a meeting room, outer room, inner room, backroom, servants quarters, annex, back garden, arbor, and lotus pond.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>• For more info: +82-43-730-3417|\n|parking:|Available (200m away)|\n|restdate:|Mondays, New Year's Day, Seollal (Lunar New Year's Day) and Chuseok (Korean Thanksgiving Day) holidays|\n|usetime:|Tues.-Sun. 09:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-26-1658820864445/1953557_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-26-1658820864445/1953557_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-26-1658820864445/1953558_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-26-1658820864445/1953558_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-26-1658820864445/1953559_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-26-1658820864445/1953559_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-26-1658820864445/1953560_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-26-1658820864445/1953560_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-26-1658820864445/1953561_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-26-1658820864445/1953561_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-26-1658820864445/1953562_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-26-1658820864445/1953562_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-26-1658820864445/1953563_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-26-1658820864445/1953563_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-26-1658820864445/1953567_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-26-1658820864445/1953567_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-26-1658820864445/1953569_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-26-1658820864445/1953569_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-43-730-3417](tel:+82437303417)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.3179146226\nlongitude: 127.5877785734\ntitle: 119 Hyangsu-gil, Okcheon-eup, Okcheon-gun, Chungcheongbuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \nFrom Dong Seoul Bus Terminal, take a bus to Okcheon Intercity Bus Terminal.

During the early years of Catholicism in Korea, Catholics fleeing from the Sinhae Persecution (1791) came to this place, formed a community, and made their faith deeper. Amid the persecution in 1801, A man named Hwang Sa-yeong (Alexander, 1775–1801) hid in a tunnel and wrote letters about the situation of the Joseon Catholic Church on silk fabrics, but was captured and martyred. Baeron is also a historic place where Joseon’s first theological school, St. Joseph Theological School, was founded, but the school was eventually shut down. The graves of Fr. Thomas Choe Yang-eop (1821–1861), Korea’s second Roman Catholic priest, and the Martyr Hwang Sa-yeong Memorial Tower can be seen at Baeron Holy Ground.<br> <br> Baeron Holy Ground is surrounded by rugged mountains such as Guhaksan Mountain, Baegunsan Mountain and Chiaksan Mountain. The mountain path from the holy ground eventually leads to Bakdaljae Natural Forest.","regDate":"2022-07-26","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Holy Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-26-1658810928103/2026149_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Chungcheongbuk-do/2022-07-26-1658810928103","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Chungcheongbuk-do/2022-07-26-1658810928103"},{"id":"2022-07-26-1658804661068","title":"Angseong Carbonate Hot Springs (앙성탄산온천)","description":"The water at Angseong Carbonate Hot Springs comes from 700 meters underground.
