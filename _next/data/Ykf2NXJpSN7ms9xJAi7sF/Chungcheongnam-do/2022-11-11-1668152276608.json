This temple enshrines a Seokjomireukbosalipsang Buddha (Treasure), which was built over the course of 38 years, beginning in 967 during the Goryeo period. According to legend, while a lady was picking fernbrake on Banyasan Mountain, she heard a baby crying. When she went&nbsp;over, there was no baby but instead was a large rock sticking out from the ground. Upon hearing this story, the government ordered a Buddha statue to be made from the rock. This Buddha statue, widely known as ‚ÄòEunjimireuk Buddha,‚Äô is the largest stone Buddha in Korea (18.12 meters in x_height, 9.9 meters in girth, 1.8 meters in the length of ears, 2.43 meters at the x_height of crown).
