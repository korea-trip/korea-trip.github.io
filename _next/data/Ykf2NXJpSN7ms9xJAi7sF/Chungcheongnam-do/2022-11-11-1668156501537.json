The island is 53 kilometers off the mainland coast and can only be reached by taking a two-and-a-half-hour boat ride from Daecheonhang Port. The history of the islands inhabitation dates back to 202 BC when a Chinese General named Jeonhoeng settled here with about 500 followers after fleeing his failing Je Kingdom. Every year the villagers have a ceremony to commemorate the General, and even pray to him for strength during childbirth.<br><br>The evergreen forest located behind the main village is designated Natural Monument No. 136, and is comprised of many tree species. The most famous attraction in the forest is called the Love Trees, two camellia trees that have grown entwined. The locals believe if a young couple passes between the two tree trunks, they will have eternal love. Another must-see attraction on Oeyeondo Island is the sun setting over the horizon. The scene is so beautiful, it has been classified as one of the Eight Scenic Views of Boryeong.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <BR>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-41-932-2023|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-11-1668156501537/2671536_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668156501537/2671536_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-11-1668156501537/2671537_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668156501537/2671537_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-11-1668156501537/2671538_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668156501537/2671538_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-11-1668156501537/2671539_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668156501537/2671539_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-11-1668156501537/2671540_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668156501537/2671540_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-11-1668156501537/2671541_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668156501537/2671541_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-11-1668156501537/2671542_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668156501537/2671542_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-11-1668156501537/2671543_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668156501537/2671543_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-11-1668156501537/2671544_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-11-1668156501537/2671544_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-41-932-2023](tel:+82419322023)\n- [üè†www.brcn.go.kr/tour.do](https://bit.ly/3xuopm9)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.2264434555\nlongitude: 126.0803884162\ntitle: 64, Oeyeondo 1-gil, Boryeong-si, Chungcheongnam-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-11-1668156501537","title":"Oeyeondo Island (Ïô∏Ïó∞ÎèÑ)","description":"Oeyeondo Islands name carries the meaning of being a far-distant island hidden in fog.
