Originally, the temple was called Samseonam, or Three Hermitages, for there had been three hermitages in the upper, middle, and lower part of Buchunsan Mountain. During the late Joseon dynasty, the hermitages in the upper and middle part were closed and only the one at the bottom survived.

The third peak is the highest, standing at 362 meters with a beautiful view and crisp air, making it ideal for hiking (3-hour course) and resting at the top.
