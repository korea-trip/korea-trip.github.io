The forest is composed of 100-year-old white pine trees brimming with pine nuts, along with pines and larches. In the forest, you can see the trees standing tall amidst the majestic rock formations. If you walk along the mountain trail, you will come to a suspension bridge, and after crossing, you will enter a section of forest that has maintained an old, almost primeval, feeling.\n<br><br>\nIn spring, beautiful wild flowers blossom throughout the forest, magnolias in particular, bloom within the valley. Cheongoksan National Recreational Forest features a variety of facilities such as a nearby water park, children‚Äôs playground, fitness center, campsite and an outdoor lecture field. The water in the water park is cold and very clean, using natural stream water. In nearby Baekcheongyegok Valley, you may also see Manchurian trout, which live in clean, fresh water streams. Hyeonbulsa Temple is also located in the valley.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|accomcount:|1,000 people a day|\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-54-672-1051|\n|opendate:|August 7, 1991|\n|parking:|Available|\n|usetime:|[Accommodations] Check in 15:00 / Check out 12:00<br>[General park hours] 09:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 1,000 won / Children 600 won / Preschoolers 300 won<br>Groups - Adults 800 won / Children 500 won / Preschoolers 200 won<br><br>* Adults (ages 19-64) / Children (ages 7-18) / Preschoolers (ages 6 and younger)<br>* Groups: 20 people or more<br>* Free admission December-March|\n|Available Facilities:|Accommodations, training facilities, outdoor facilities, etc.|\n|Facility Utilization Fees:|Varies by facility; please make an inquiry in advance.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Light-weight vehicles 1,500 won / Small & mid-sized vehicles 3,000 won / Large vehicles 5,000 won|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999491_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999491_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999492_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999492_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999493_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999493_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999495_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999495_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999497_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999497_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999498_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999498_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999499_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999499_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999500_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999500_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999502_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999502_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999503_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999503_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-54-672-1051](tel:+82546721051)\n- [üè†www.huyang.go.kr](http://www.huyang.go.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.0391887631\nlongitude: 128.9956517691\ntitle: 1552-163, Cheongok-ro, Bonghwa-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Train]<br>\nTake a train from Cheongnyangni Station to Taebaek Station.<br><br>\n\n[Taxi]<br>\nApprox. 25 min from Taebaek Station.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-29-1659130731634","title":"Cheongoksan National Recreational Forest (Íµ≠Î¶Ω Ï≤≠Ïò•ÏÇ∞ÏûêÏó∞Ìú¥ÏñëÎ¶º)","description":"Cheongoksan National Recreational Forest is located in Bonghwa-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do.

When Kim Jeongho made the Daedongyeojido Map, he visited this place seven times to confirm this area is in fact the easternmost part of Korea. Following the resources of Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute, the sunrise time of Homigot on January 1 is at 7 32 am, making it the earliest first sunrise of each year in Korea. The plaza was built to commemorate these research findings with the national Sunrise Festival. Nearby attractions include Koreas largest lighthouse, Homigot Lighthouse, established in 1908; Lighthouse Museum; Monument to Commemorate Lee Yuk-sa‚Äôs Patriotism; and Daebo Seawater Bath, using pure seawater of the East Sea. <br><br>When completed, Homigot Tourism Complex and Homigot Specialized Ocean Leisure Complex will be the largest tourism complex in the eastern coast district. It will include an ocean aquarium, Ocean Ecological Park, Youth Training facilities, beach dome, accommodation facilities, and other various stores as well. <br><br> Sangsaeng‚Äôs Hand, a two-part bronze sculpture shaped like a pair of hands, was constructed in December 1999. It is a signature symbol of the sunrise festival. The left hand is on the land and the right hand is in the ocean. It was built to give the message that all people are living together by helping one another like Sangsaeng, meaning coexistence in Korean. The base of the platform is an image of the sun and its two round rings refer to harmony. These two hands have memorial sprits of reconciliation and coexistence for celebrating a new millennium.","regDate":"2022-12-01","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-01-1669884185831/2527505_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-01-1669884185831"},{"id":"2022-12-01-1669880159629","title":"Homigot Lighthouse (Ìò∏ÎØ∏Í≥∂ Îì±ÎåÄ)","description":"Homigot Lighthouse is located at Homigot Cape, listed as one of the 10 most scenic sites during the Joseon dynasty.
