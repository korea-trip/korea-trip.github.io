His house is the oldest private residence in Korea, and was originally General Choi Yeong‚Äôs home, before he turned it over to his grand son-in-law, Maeng Sa-seong. The simple residence houses two 600-year-old gingko trees in the yard. Therefore it has been named ‚ÄòHaengdan‚Äô, meaning that Confucius taught on top of the gingko tree symbolizing a place of learning. For that reason it is inferred that Maeng Sa-seong intentionally planted gingko trees in the yard and taught junior scholars. The two gingko trees provide a cool shade and give out five sacks of gingko nuts each year.","regDate":"2022-07-28","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Old Houses"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-28-1658986913216/1495766_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Chungcheongnam-do/2022-07-28-1658986913216","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Chungcheongnam-do/2022-07-28-1658986913216"},{"id":"2022-07-28-1658984540847","title":"Archaeological Site in Seokjang-ri, Gongju (Í≥µÏ£º ÏÑùÏû•Î¶¨ Ïú†Ï†Å)","description":"The Archaeological Site in Seokjang-ri, Gongju is located approximately 6 kilometers out of the city of Gongju, on the northern banks of the Geumgang River.

The site was excavated 10 times between 1964 and 1974 by teams from Yonsei University Museum. The excavation of 27 layers of stratum produced relics proving people lived in the area through 11 cultural eras. The area was excavated again in 1990 and 1993, producing even more cultural artifacts and helping to create a clearer image of the people living in that time.","regDate":"2022-07-28","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-28-1658984540847/531206_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Chungcheongnam-do/2022-07-28-1658984540847","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Chungcheongnam-do/2022-07-28-1658984540847"},{"id":"2022-07-28-1658981694068","title":"Anmyeondo Island Recreational Forest (ÏïàÎ©¥ÎèÑÏûêÏó∞Ìú¥ÏñëÎ¶º)","description":"Anmyeondo in Taean is home to a 100 year old pine tree forest that is special in Korea.
