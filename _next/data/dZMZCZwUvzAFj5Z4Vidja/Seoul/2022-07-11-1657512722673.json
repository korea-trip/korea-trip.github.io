The preservation value of this area is especially high as the valley is home to a large colony of salamanders, which are indicator species of the clean water and a protected wildlife species of Seoul. <br><br>\n\nThe valley gets its name from the site of a villa of Yi Hangbok. The path along the area’s thick forest and natural valleys provides an excellent getaway. Since the area is a habitat to several protected species, visitors are asked to refrain from dipping their feet in the valley’s waters while exploring the scenery. The entrance to the valley is located past the Sanmotungi Café.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-2-2148-1114|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-11-1657512722673/1859941_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-11-1657512722673/1859941_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-11-1657512722673/1860160_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-11-1657512722673/1860160_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-11-1657512722673/1860161_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-11-1657512722673/1860161_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-2-2148-1114](tel:+82221481114)\n- [🏠tour.jongno.go.kr](http://tour.jongno.go.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.6004834158\nlongitude: 126.9663489448\ntitle: 115, Buam-dong, Jongno-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nTake Bus No. 7022 near Gyeongbokgung Station (Seoul Subwya Line 3), and get off at Segumjung Elementary School Bus Stop.<br>\nWalk in the opposite direction of the bus and take a left at the first three-way Intersection, continuing to walk for about 400 m. <br>There will be a sign for the valley ahead.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-11-1657512722673","title":"Baeksasilgyegok Valley (백사실계곡)","description":"Baeksasilgyegok Valley in Seoul is a well preserved cultural and natural site, being home to Baekseokdongcheon, Historic Site No. 462, as well as a habitat to diverse animals, including salamanders, frogs, minnows, and crayfish.
