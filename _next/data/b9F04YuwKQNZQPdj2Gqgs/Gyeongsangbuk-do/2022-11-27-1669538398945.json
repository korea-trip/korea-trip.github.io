Records are found describing that the area was visited by King Sukjong and other prominent figures in Korean history for the astounding views seen from the pavilion.<br><br>Mangyang Beach is shallow and narrow, but it is relatively warm among the beaches on the east coast. With a lush pine forest along the shore, the beach is quiet year-round, making it a pleasant attraction to walk and relax. When the waves are calm, visitors can see Turtle Rock protruding out from the ocean. The beach is a popular destination for summer travelers thanks to the numerous nearby attractions including Seongryugul Cave (Natural Monument No. 155) and Bulyeonggyegok Valley.","regDate":"2022-12-03","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-03-1670042423588/183243_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-03-1670042423588"},{"id":"2022-12-03-1670038628325","title":"Laseonjae (ÌïúÍµ≠Ïó≠ÏÇ¨Î¨∏ÌôîÏùåÏãùÌïôÍµê ÎùºÏÑ†Ïû¨)","description":"Housed in the Culinary School of Korea History and Culture in Gyeongju, the Laseonjae restaurant serves unique culinary delights that recreate the cuisine served in the royal courts of the Silla Kingdom.

Joseon-era Confucian scholar Toegye Yi Hwang (1501-1570) was inspired by the scenery of the valley and the enchanting sound of the flowing water, so he came up with names for each of the nine sections of the valley and collectively called them Jukgyegugok (nine bamboo valleys). The valley presents a splendid sight indeed with crystal clear waters, lush forest, and white rocks. In summer, vacationers from around the country flock to Jukgyegugok Valley to cool off from the sweltering heat by dipping their feet in the refreshing waters of the valley. Famous tourist attractions near the valley include Sosuseowon Confucian Academy, Buseoksa Temple, and Eupnaeri Mural Tomb.<br><br>* Choamsa Temple<br>On the path that ascends from Jukgyegugok Valley, there is a small temple located at the foot of Sobaeksan Mountain. The great monk Uisang Daesa of the Silla Kingdom reached this place during his search for an ideal site to build a Buddhist temple invoking national security. He set up a small thatched hut for a temporary stay until he found the most propitious spot, on which he built Buseoksa Temple. In the site where his thatched hut once stood, he built another temple and named it Choamsa Temple. The original structure was destroyed by fire during the Korean War (1950-1953). The temple has been restored to its present state by the Buddhist monk Lee Bo-won after years of arduous efforts.","regDate":"2022-12-02","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Valleys"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-02-1669973794677/2376704_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-02-1669973794677"},{"id":"2022-12-02-1669970358512","title":"Jukbyeonhang Port (Ï£ΩÎ≥ÄÌï≠)","description":"Jukbyeonhang Port is a fishing port in northern Uljin.
