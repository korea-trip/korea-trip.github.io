Its 135,000 m2 seaside is made up of the mysterious rock formations and rocky islands of the East Sea, a sight that has, along with the nearby pine forests, given the area a distinguished place among the Eight Sights. The name of the beach, Hajodae, is said to come from Ha Ryun and Jo Jun, two late Goryeo-era officials who plotted to overthrow the dynasty and would eventually become one of the founding officials of Joseon. A pavilion, also named Hajodae, can be found on top of the coastal cliff. Today‚Äôs pavilion is a restoration dating back to 1998, while the original was established during the reign of King Jeongjong of the Joseon Dynasty and underwent numerous renovations. The pavilion is the favored point of view for many visitors. An old pine tree standing upright on the rocky cliff was made famous for its appearance on the broadcasted screen for the national anthem of Korea. Following the decked walkways from the pavilion brings one to the white unmanned lighthouse, or the nearby Hajodae Trail and Observatory. Hajodae Beach can be found about 1 km to the northwest of the area. Its relatively shallow depth, reaching no more than 1.5 m, makes it ideal for families with small children.","regDate":"2022-09-26","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-26-1664185593717/2711324_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-09-26-1664185593717"},{"id":"2022-09-26-1664182522172","title":"Haegasa Site (Surobuin Park) (Ìï¥Í∞ÄÏÇ¨Ïùò ÌÑ∞(ÏàòÎ°úÎ∂ÄÏù∏Í≥µÏõê))","description":"Haegasa is a site named after the tale of Haega in The Heritage of the Three States.
