The crystal clear waters of the Hantangang River wind around Goseokbawi Rock, a peculiarly shaped rock of about 10 meters tall that stands dominantly in the middle of the river. Goseokjeong Pavilion is a two-story tower-style pavilion that has an area of about 33 square meters, built halfway up the Hantangang River during the reign of King Jinpyeong (r. AD 579-632) of the Silla Kingdom. Today, Goseokjeong refers to the entire area around Goseokjeong Pavilion and the valley surrounding Goseok Rock. Designated as a Monument of Gangwon-do, the pavilion is known to have been one of the most favored places by King Jinpyeong of Silla Kingdom, and King Chungsuk of Goryeo dynasty. The area became all the more famous as the arena of Im Kkeok-jeong (?-1562), who was a legendary leader of a peasant rebellion in the early Joseon dynasty. <br><br>The pavilion was destroyed during the Korean War and restored in 1971 by community leaders in Cheorwon. Unfortunately, it was damaged once again by flood in 1996 and reconstructed the year after. There is a natural stone chamber inside Goseokbawi Rock that Im Kkeok-jeong used as a hiding place. On the opposite side, there are remains of a stone castle. Jiktang Waterfall is located about 2 kilometers up from this site, while Sundam Valley is situated about 2 kilometers in the downstream. Goseokjeong is a year-round tourist attraction with an extensive grass square and recreational facilities. It is also the starting point for DMZ tours as the Iron Triangle Battlefield Conservation Office is located here and in winter, visitors can enjoy migratory bird tour.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-33-450-5558, 5559|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|Tuesdays, Seollal (Lunar New Year‚Äôs Day) & Chuseok (Korean Thanksgiving Day) holidays|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Tour Course Information:|[Safety Tour departing from Goseokjeong] Goseokjeong - The 2nd Underground Tunnel - Cheorwon Peace Observatory - Cheorwon Durumi Hall (Crane Pavilion) - Woljeong-ri Station|\n|Parking Fees:|Small cars: 2,000 won / Large vehicles: 5,000 won|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Goseokjeong Land, Iron Triangle Battlefield, Discontinued Plane Exhibition Hall, Boat, etc.|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-09-24-1664012586092/2385876_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-24-1664012586092/2385876_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-24-1664012586092/2567094_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-24-1664012586092/2567094_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-24-1664012586092/2567096_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-24-1664012586092/2567096_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-24-1664012586092/2567100_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-24-1664012586092/2567100_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-24-1664012586092/2567101_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-24-1664012586092/2567101_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-24-1664012586092/2615220_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-24-1664012586092/2615220_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-24-1664012586092/2385870_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-24-1664012586092/2385870_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-24-1664012586092/2385873_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-24-1664012586092/2385873_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-24-1664012586092/2385875_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-24-1664012586092/2385875_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-09-24-1664012586092/2385878_image2_1.webp](/2022-09-24-1664012586092/2385878_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-33-450-5558](tel:+82334505558)\n- [üè†www.cwg.go.kr](https://bit.ly/36cUYsF)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 38.1860265295\nlongitude: 127.2869221163\ntitle: 1825, Taebong-ro, Cheorwon-gun, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-09-24-1664012586092","title":"Goseokjeong National Tourist Area (Í≥†ÏÑùÏ†ïÍµ≠ÎØºÍ¥ÄÍ¥ëÏßÄ)","description":"Goseokjeong Pavilion is the most scenic spot among the eight scenic views of Cheorwon.

Its name, Jujeongol, is said to come from the Joseon-era bandits that are said to have settled in the area, making their living with counterfeit (ju) coins (jeon) while disguised as Buddhist monks. Osaek (meaning ‚Äúfive colors‚Äù) was inspired by the five colors of Jujeongol‚Äôs rock formations, and the five-colored tree that is said to have lived in Osaekseoksa Temple of the past.
