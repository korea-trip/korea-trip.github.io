After having the throne taken away by Suyang Daegun, his uncle, Danjong was condemned to exile in Yeongwol County, where he was later murdered and his remains were abandoned in the Donggang River. When no one else was brave enough to find his body, Eom Heung-do, the governor of Yeongwol Lake, found his body and buried him in the tomb that later became Jangneung, one of the royal tombs of the Joseon dynasty. Danjong had been stripped of his title at the time he was exiled. His title was later restored in year 1698, during the reign of King Sukjong, and received his posthumous name Danjong, and thereafter was referred to as King Danjong. <br><br>Jangneung houses such buildings as Jeongjagak, Baesikdansa, Jaesil, Yeongcheon, and Hongsammun, and a history hall with relics of Danjong. The area is surrounded by magnificent pine trees. Since 1967, a religious service called Danjongje is held every year on April 5th, according to the lunar calendar, in commemoration of Danjong.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-33-374-4215<br>+82-1577-0545|\n|parking:|Available (small-sized vehicles 100 / large vehicles 20)|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00 (Last admission 17:00)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Tour Course Information:|Jangneung - Bodeoksa Temple - Geummongam Rock - Cheongnyeong Falls - Gwangpungheon, Jaguryu - Geumgangjeong|\n|Admission Fees:|Individual - Adults 2,000 won / Teenagers 1,500 won / Children 1,000 won<br> Group - Adults 1,500 won / Teenagers 1,000 won / Children 800 won<br><br> * Group: 30 people or more<br>* Free for senior citizens aged 65 or over|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Guide in English, Japanese, Chinese available via QR code|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-10-01-1664600620874/564597_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-01-1664600620874/564597_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-01-1664600620874/564609_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-01-1664600620874/564609_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-01-1664600620874/564613_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-01-1664600620874/564613_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-01-1664600620874/1692344_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-01-1664600620874/1692344_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-01-1664600620874/1692346_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-01-1664600620874/1692346_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-01-1664600620874/1692361_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-01-1664600620874/1692361_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-01-1664600620874/1692367_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-01-1664600620874/1692367_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-01-1664600620874/1692372_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-01-1664600620874/1692372_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-01-1664600620874/2517632_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-01-1664600620874/2517632_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-10-01-1664600620874/564584_image2_1.webp](/2022-10-01-1664600620874/564584_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-33-374-4215](tel:+82333744215)\n- [üè†www.yw.go.kr</a> <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br> <a title=\"new window popup\" href=\"http://www.cha.go.kr/\" target=\"_blank\">www.cha.go.kr](http://www.yw.go.kr/tour)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.1973824361\nlongitude: 128.4519679070\ntitle: 190, Danjong-ro, Yeongwol-gun, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\n From Seoul Express Bus Terminal, take a bus to Yeongwol Bus Terminal. <br>\n In front of the bus terminal, take a city bus in the direction of Jojeolli.<br>\n Get off at Jangneung Bus Stop (approx. 15 min).<br>\n","data":{"id":"2022-10-01-1664600620874","title":"Jangneung Royal Tomb [UNESCO World Heritage] (ÏòÅÏõî Ïû•Î¶â(Îã®Ï¢Ö) [Ïú†ÎÑ§Ïä§ÏΩî ÏÑ∏Í≥ÑÎ¨∏ÌôîÏú†ÏÇ∞])","description":"Jangneung is the tomb of Danjong, the 6th king of the Joseon dynasty (r. 1441-1457).

Its name, Jujeongol, is said to come from the Joseon-era bandits that are said to have settled in the area, making their living with counterfeit (ju) coins (jeon) while disguised as Buddhist monks. Osaek (meaning ‚Äúfive colors‚Äù) was inspired by the five colors of Jujeongol‚Äôs rock formations, and the five-colored tree that is said to have lived in Osaekseoksa Temple of the past. A 3.2 km-long trail brings visitors along the rising rocks next to the valley, connecting Seongguksa Temple and Seonnyeotang Pothole to Yongso Falls Information Center. It is a relatively flat, 1 hr-long course with many wooden decks that help to make it more accessible for the visitors. The entrance to the trail is the location of the Osaek Mineral Spring, whose natural carbonation and iron content impart a unique flavor in the water.
