This site was originally the location of Garyangsa Temple, which was constructed in 854, during the 16th year of King Munseong of the Silla Kingdom. The temple was very famous as it was surrounded by beautiful mountains and crystal clear waters. However, the temple was destroyed by fire during the Manchu War of 1636.<br><br>During the Joseon dynasty, King Jeongjo moved the tomb of his father to this spot, and built Yongjusa Temple here to pray for the repose of his father’s soul. It is said that one night before the temple was completed, King Jeongjo dreamt of a dragon ascending to the sky holding a magic ball in its mouth. He therefore named the temple “Yongjusa,” which means the temple of a dragon with a magic ball in Korean.<br><br>The courtyard of the temple contains the Bronze Bell of Yongjusa Temple, a National Treasure; a stone pagoda; Daeungbojeon (the main hall); and Cheonboru Pavilion. Visitors to Yongjusa Temple can also find the “Bumoeunjunggyeong” books, which were written by King Jeongjo on the subject of filial affection and respect for one’s parents. These days, Yongjusa Temple and the Yungneung and Geolleung Royal Tombs are highly valued for their cultural heritage.","regDate":"2022-08-27","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-27-1661585850373/1593656_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-08-27-1661585850373"},{"id":"2022-08-27-1661582774696","title":"Hwaseong Fossilized Dinosaur Egg Site (화성 공룡알 화석지)","description":"The Hwaseong Fossilized Dinosaur Egg Site was discovered on an island in the tidal plain south of Sihwaho Lake. The island was revealed when seawaters were blocked during a land reclamation project. As the sedimentary layer formed during the Cretaceous period of the Mesozoic Era (dated around 83 million to 85 million years ago) was eroded by weathering, roughly 200 dinosaur eggs in thirty nests were discovered at twelve dig sites. It is anticipated that more fossils will be discovered once a thorough investigation is carried out and more land is reclaimed.<br><be>Most dinosaur eggs are oval shaped and dark red. Considering the properties of the fossilized shells, the eggs that have been discovered so far are assumed to belong to four-legged herbivorous dinosaurs with a long neck and tail, and two-legged herbivorous dinosaurs, including the hadrosaur. A wide range of plant fossils were also discovered alongside the fossilized eggs, leading to expectations that the formerly lush environment may yet be restored.<br><br>The discovery of the Fossilized Dinosaur Egg Site in Hwaseong has greatly expanded the scope of Korean paleontology; previous paleontological discoveries were exclusively limited to fossilized dinosaur footprints. This significant discovery has attracted many internationally renowned scholars who have visited the site in Hwaseong.","regDate":"2022-08-27","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Eco-Tourism Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-27-1661582774696/2040876_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-08-27-1661582774696"},{"id":"2022-08-27-1661579189055","title":"Hwaseomun Gate (화서문)","description":"Hwaseomun Gate is the western gate of Hwaseong Fortress, Treasure No. 403.
