The island is famous for sea fishing, and is accessible via ferry from Museulpo Port.<br><br>Marado Island first became inhabited in 1883, when three families began living there. At first they lived off the food growing there, but once the food became scarce, they burned the forests to create fields for farming. It was said that all the snakes and frogs died in that fire, and thus no snakes and frogs are found in Marado Island even until now.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-64-760-4014|\n|parking:|Available at the harbor|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Accommodations, restaurants, Marado Lighthouse, Pioneer Open Air Museum, The Southernmost Monument, etc.|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-02-10-1676004031764/200086_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-10-1676004031764/200086_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-10-1676004031764/200099_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-10-1676004031764/200099_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-10-1676004031764/200111_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-10-1676004031764/200111_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-10-1676004031764/865913_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-10-1676004031764/865913_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-10-1676004031764/1281904_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-10-1676004031764/1281904_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-10-1676004031764/1281919_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-10-1676004031764/1281919_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-10-1676004031764/1281923_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-10-1676004031764/1281923_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-10-1676004031764/1281935_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-10-1676004031764/1281935_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-10-1676004031764/200116_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-10-1676004031764/200116_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-10-1676004031764/1281917_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-10-1676004031764/1281917_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-64-760-4014](tel:+82647604014)\n- [üè†www.jejumarado.com](http://www.jejumarado.com/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.1186350844\nlongitude: 126.2674344514\ntitle: 46, Mara-ro 101beon-gil, Seogwipo-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Ferry]<br>\nTake a ferry from Museulpo Port to Marado Island.\n","data":{"id":"2023-02-10-1676004031764","title":"Marado Island (Mara Provincial Park) (ÎßàÎùºÎèÑ(ÎßàÎùºÌï¥ÏñëÎèÑÎ¶ΩÍ≥µÏõê))","description":"Marado Island is the southernmost island in Korea and features one seemingly endless plain of waving grass for a unique landscape.

The cliffs on the southern side of the lava dome are marked with a rich variety of curious formations such as weathering pits and talus scree slopes, some of which are as high as 200 meters. As its name ‚Äòsanbang‚Äô ‚Äì literally meaning ‚Äòa cave inside a mountain‚Äô ‚Äì suggests, this mountain contains a cave, which is located about 150 meters above sea level and has a spectacular view out over the ocean. Due to its close location to the sea and its high elevation, the peak is often ringed with clouds. The upper slopes of the mountain have their own distinct climatic conditions and are protected for their value for botanical research. <br><br>The Sanbangsa Temple and  Bomunsa Temple, which holds the relics of Buddha, are both located on the mountain. Walk along the stone-steps between the two temples and you will find the Sanbanggulsa Grotto. A signal beacon called ‚ÄòYeondae‚Äô in Korean stands at the roadside in front of the mountain, which, in the past, used to fire and smoke to relay urgent messages. Regarding function, it is similar to the more well-known ‚ÄòBongsudae‚Äô signal beacons; but ‚ÄòYeondae‚Äô beacons were built around hilly or coastal areas while ‚ÄòBongsudae‚Äô beacons were built on mountain tops. During the daytime, smoke was used to send warning signals, while fire was used at night. <br><br>*x_height above sea level  395.2m/ x_height above ground-level  345m/ Circumference  3,780m / Area  988,332„é°/ Diameter 1,314m","regDate":"2023-02-11","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-11-1676090352667/2648186_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-11-1676090352667"},{"id":"2023-02-11-1676086600762","title":"Sanbanggulsa Grotto - Jeju (ÏÇ∞Î∞©Íµ¥ÏÇ¨(Ï†úÏ£º))","description":"It is said that the peak of Hallasan Mountain where Baekrokho Lake now exists was taken off and thrown away, which then became Sanbangsan Mountain.
