The site houses anexhibition hall, a monument, and a unique mud fortress. Nearby is Jangsumul Spring (Jangsu means general) which flowed from the footprints of General Kim Tong-jeong. Today, water from the springcannot be used as drinking water.<br><br>Sambyeolcho was a military unit of the Goryeo dynasty. When the Goryeo dynasty made peace with the Mongolian forces in February 1270 (the 11th year of King Wonjong), the Sambyeolcho special defense unit opposed it and launched a resistance movement. They moved their base to Jindo in Jeollanam-do, but after suffering a huge defeat, they moved to Jeju-do and built Hangpaduseong Fortress. They continued to fight against the Mongolian forces for two more years there. However, all the members were killed in April 1273 (the 14th year of King Wonjong).<br> <br>This independent anti-Mongolian movement was born out the deeply patriotic belief in the need to safeguard the nation from foreign invasion. In 1977, the government invested 745 million won to restore part of the fortress and build a monument in commemoration of those who died in the war. The work was completed in June 1978.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-64-710-6721~2|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Exhibition hall, management office, rest area|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-02-07-1675755361292/1618313_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-07-1675755361292/1618313_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-07-1675755361292/1618315_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-07-1675755361292/1618315_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-07-1675755361292/1618316_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-07-1675755361292/1618316_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-07-1675755361292/1618317_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-07-1675755361292/1618317_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-07-1675755361292/1618318_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-07-1675755361292/1618318_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-07-1675755361292/1618319_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-07-1675755361292/1618319_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-64-710-6721](tel:+82647106721)\n- [üè†www.jeju.go.kr](https://www.jeju.go.kr/hangpadori/index.htm)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 33.4523365568\nlongitude: 126.4089619525\ntitle: 50, Hangpaduri-ro, Jeju-si, Jeju-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2023-02-07-1675755361292","title":"Historic Site of Anti-Mongolian Struggle in Hangpadu-ri, Jeju (Ï†úÏ£º Ìï≠ÌååÎëêÎ¶¨ Ìï≠Î™Ω Ïú†Ï†Å)","description":"Historic Site of Anti-Mongolian Struggle in Hangpadu-ri is where the Sambyeolcho military unit of the Goryeo dynasty resisted the invasion of Mongolia until the last possible moment.

The cliffs on the southern side of the lava dome are marked with a rich variety of curious formations such as weathering pits and talus scree slopes, some of which are as high as 200 meters. As its name ‚Äòsanbang‚Äô ‚Äì literally meaning ‚Äòa cave inside a mountain‚Äô ‚Äì suggests, this mountain contains a cave, which is located about 150 meters above sea level and has a spectacular view out over the ocean. Due to its close location to the sea and its high elevation, the peak is often ringed with clouds. The upper slopes of the mountain have their own distinct climatic conditions and are protected for their value for botanical research. <br><br>The Sanbangsa Temple and  Bomunsa Temple, which holds the relics of Buddha, are both located on the mountain. Walk along the stone-steps between the two temples and you will find the Sanbanggulsa Grotto. A signal beacon called ‚ÄòYeondae‚Äô in Korean stands at the roadside in front of the mountain, which, in the past, used to fire and smoke to relay urgent messages. Regarding function, it is similar to the more well-known ‚ÄòBongsudae‚Äô signal beacons; but ‚ÄòYeondae‚Äô beacons were built around hilly or coastal areas while ‚ÄòBongsudae‚Äô beacons were built on mountain tops. During the daytime, smoke was used to send warning signals, while fire was used at night. <br><br>*x_height above sea level  395.2m/ x_height above ground-level  345m/ Circumference  3,780m / Area  988,332„é°/ Diameter 1,314m","regDate":"2023-02-11","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-11-1676090352667/2648186_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-11-1676090352667"},{"id":"2023-02-11-1676086600762","title":"Sanbanggulsa Grotto - Jeju (ÏÇ∞Î∞©Íµ¥ÏÇ¨(Ï†úÏ£º))","description":"It is said that the peak of Hallasan Mountain where Baekrokho Lake now exists was taken off and thrown away, which then became Sanbangsan Mountain.

You can also see small ponds being made by the water drops that fall from the ceiling all through the year. The plant zone on a cliff of Sanbangsan Mountain is also designated as a natural monument.

On the Dragon Head Coast is the Hamel Memorial Monument.","regDate":"2023-02-11","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-11-1676086600762/1036539_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-11-1676086600762"},{"id":"2023-02-10-1676025543867","title":"Sammaebong Peak (ÏÇºÎß§Î¥â)","description":"Sammaebong Peak is residental park popular among tourists.
