Simnidae Forest was once in danger of demolition as part of the government's flood control plans but remains preserved thanks to community efforts.

In 1598, the fortress was taken over by Korea with the assistance of General Magwi of the Ming dynasty. A year later, Changpyodang Shrine was built in honor of 53 Koreans who died during battles against the Japanese invading forces. However, the shrine was destroyed during the Japanese imperialism period and no trace of it remains. It is possible to tell from Seosaengpo Jinseongdo (a map drawn up in 1872) that the fortress was also partially used by  Korean forces.","regDate":"2022-08-19","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Ulsan","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Fortresses"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-19-1660914228428/217707_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Ulsan/2022-08-19-1660914228428"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
