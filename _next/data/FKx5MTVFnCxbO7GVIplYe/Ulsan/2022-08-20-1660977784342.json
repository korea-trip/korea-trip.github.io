The river basin, which stretches 36 kilometers from east to west and 28 kilometers from north to south, is mostly comprised of mountainous terrain, but there is fertile land on both sides of the river and at the southern end of the river. The river is presently an important source of drinking water for the citizens of Ulsan. <br>\n<br> The field around the midpoint of Taehwagang River was left abandoned for a long time before it was founded as Taehwagang National Garden, preserving nature while providing a resting spot to the citizens of Ulsan. The garden is over twice the size of Yeouido Park in Seoul, and consists of natural water and a lush bamboo forest, known as Simnidae Forest, along with canola and forage barley fields. Simnidae Forest was once in danger of demolition as part of the government's flood control plans but remains preserved thanks to community efforts. Preservation efforts led to turning the area into Taehwagang National Garden of today, which took place from 2004 to 2010.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-52-229-3147~8|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Open 24 hr (except certain facilities)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Walking path, field, drinking fountain, outdoor stage, multi-purpose square, bamboo ecology institute, photo zone, benches, etc.|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-20-1660977784342/1804924_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-20-1660977784342/1804924_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-20-1660977784342/1804927_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-20-1660977784342/1804927_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-20-1660977784342/1804929_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-20-1660977784342/1804929_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-20-1660977784342/1804931_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-20-1660977784342/1804931_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-20-1660977784342/1804935_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-20-1660977784342/1804935_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-20-1660977784342/2653665_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-20-1660977784342/2653665_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-20-1660977784342/1804921_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-20-1660977784342/1804921_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-20-1660977784342/1804922_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-20-1660977784342/1804922_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-20-1660977784342/1804925_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-20-1660977784342/1804925_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-20-1660977784342/1804926_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-20-1660977784342/1804926_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-52-229-3147](tel:+82522293147)\n- [🏠www.ulsan.go.kr](https://www.ulsan.go.kr/garden/index)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.5488636215\nlongitude: 129.2913162043\ntitle: 154, Taehwaganggukgajeongwon-gil, Jung-gu, Ulsan\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-20-1660977784342","title":"Taehwagang National Garden (태화강 국가정원)","description":"The Taehwagang River cuts across the heart of Ulsan and flows into Ulsan Bay, which is connected to the East Sea.

The main fortress is located on a mountaintop 200 meters above sea level, a  second fortress is halfway down the mountain, and a  third fortress is located at the bottom of the mountain. The  whole fortress is rectangular shaped. The fortress wall is 6 meters high and slants at an angle of 15 degrees.<br> <br>In 1594, a Buddhist monk named&nbsp;Samyeong-daesa came to Seosaengpo Waeseong Fortress four times to negotiate for peace, but he failed each time. In 1598, the fortress was taken over by Korea with the assistance of General Magwi of the Ming dynasty. A year later, Changpyodang Shrine was built in honor of 53 Koreans who died during battles against the Japanese invading forces. However, the shrine was destroyed during the Japanese imperialism period and no trace of it remains. It is possible to tell from Seosaengpo Jinseongdo (a map drawn up in 1872) that the fortress was also partially used by  Korean forces.","regDate":"2022-08-19","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Ulsan","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Fortresses"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-19-1660914228428/217707_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Ulsan/2022-08-19-1660914228428","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Ulsan/2022-08-19-1660914228428"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
