Joseon-era Confucian scholar Toegye Yi Hwang (1501-1570) was inspired by the scenery of the valley and the enchanting sound of the flowing water, so he came up with names for each of the nine sections of the valley and collectively called them Jukgyegugok (nine bamboo valleys). The valley presents a splendid sight indeed with crystal clear waters, lush forest, and white rocks. In summer, vacationers from around the country flock to Jukgyegugok Valley to cool off from the sweltering heat by dipping their feet in the refreshing waters of the valley. Famous tourist attractions near the valley include Sosuseowon Confucian Academy, Buseoksa Temple, and Eupnaeri Mural Tomb.<br><br>* Choamsa Temple<br>On the path that ascends from Jukgyegugok Valley, there is a small temple located at the foot of Sobaeksan Mountain. The great monk Uisang Daesa of the Silla Kingdom reached this place during his search for an ideal site to build a Buddhist temple invoking national security. He set up a small thatched hut for a temporary stay until he found the most propitious spot, on which he built Buseoksa Temple. In the site where his thatched hut once stood, he built another temple and named it Choamsa Temple. The original structure was destroyed by fire during the Korean War (1950-1953). The temple has been restored to its present state by the Buddhist monk Lee Bo-won after years of arduous efforts.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-54-636-6601|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-02-1669973794677/2376702_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-02-1669973794677/2376702_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-02-1669973794677/2376703_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-02-1669973794677/2376703_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-02-1669973794677/2376709_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-02-1669973794677/2376709_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-02-1669973794677/2376710_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-02-1669973794677/2376710_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n\n- [üè† http://tour.yeongju.go.kr ](http://tour.yeongju.go.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.9418217693\nlongitude: 128.5384037976\ntitle: Jukgye-ro 315beon-gil, Yeongju-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Train]<br>Punggi Station (Jungang Line)<br>Take a taxi to the valley.<br>(Approx. \n40 min / 15.43km away / fare: around 17,000 won)<br><br>[Bus]<br>From Central \nCity Terminal, take an express bus bound for Yeongju Bus Terminal.<br>From Yeongju \nto Baejeom-ri, take a bus for 50 minutes. <br>(Time schedule 06:20 / 08:10 / \n14:00 / 16:00 / 18:50)<br>\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-02-1669973794677","title":"Jukgyegugok Valley (Ï£ΩÍ≥ÑÍµ¨Í≥°)","description":"Jukgyegugok Valley is the valley stretching from Baejeom-ri to Choamsa Temple.

After Ju Se-bung left the county, Toegye Yi Hwang, a renowned Confician scholar, became his successor and made an official request to the king to be granted a royal charter.
