It also served as a banquet site for important national events and important visitors. The pond was created in 674, during the reign of King Munmu. The pond features three small islands, and a landscape of 12 small hills to the northeast. After the fall of Silla, the site was abandoned and forgotten. The pond was referred to as Anapji from the Goryeo and Joseon periods and onwards. In the 1980s, a pottery fragment with the letters ‚ÄúWolji‚Äù (a pond that reflects the moon) carved onto it was found, revealing the true name of the pond. After the discovery, the site was renamed to the current Donggung Palace and Wolji Pond.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-54-750-8655, 8650|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|09:00-22:00<br>* Last admission 30 minutes before closing. <br>* Advised to purchase tickets early as site is a famous nighttime attraction.|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 3,000 won / Teenagers 2,000 won / Children 1,000 won <br>Groups - Adults 2,400 won / Teenagers 1,600 won / Children 800 won<BR>* Groups: 30 people or more|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-27-1669534579762/1613358_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-27-1669534579762/1613358_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-27-1669534579762/1613362_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-27-1669534579762/1613362_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-27-1669534579762/2612560_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-27-1669534579762/2612560_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-27-1669534579762/2612562_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-27-1669534579762/2612562_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-54-750-8655](tel:+82547508655)\n- [üè†www.gyeongju.go.kr/tour](http://www.gyeongju.go.kr/tour)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.8352023996\nlongitude: 129.2283747104\ntitle: 102, Wonhwa-ro, Gyeongju-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-27-1669534579762","title":"Gyeongju Donggung Palace and Wolji Pond (Í≤ΩÏ£º ÎèôÍ∂ÅÍ≥º ÏõîÏßÄ)","description":"Gyeongju Donggung Palace and Wolji Pond was a secondary palace used by the crown prince of the Silla Kingdom.

Baegundongseowon first started as an academic institution that enshrined a memorial tablet of An Hyang, a Confucian scholar whom Ju Se-bung had deep respect for. After Ju Se-bung left the county, Toegye Yi Hwang, a renowned Confician scholar, became his successor and made an official request to the king to be granted a royal charter.
