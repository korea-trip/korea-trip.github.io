However, on the way to Jeju, he came across Bogildo Island and he was so inspired by its beauty  that he ended up settling down on Bogildo instead. <br><br>For the following 13 years, he composed great poems such as Eobusasisa (Fishermans Song for Four Seasons). Some of the mountain peaks and rocks named by him still remain on the island.<br><br>Seyeonjeong Pavilion was built by Yun Seondo and this is the birthplace of his literary works.
