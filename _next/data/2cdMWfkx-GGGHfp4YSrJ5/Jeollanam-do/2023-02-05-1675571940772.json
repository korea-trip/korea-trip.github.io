{"pageProps":{"content":"![Jinnamgwan Hall (여수 진남관)](/2023-02-05-1675571940772/600668_image2_1.webp)\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> Jinnamgwan Hall (National Treasure) is located at the site of the Jeolla Province naval base during the Joseon dynasty. At that time, it was a watchtower called Jimhaeru, where Admiral Yi Sun-sin commanded his forces during the Imjin War (1592-1598). The original building burned down near the end of the war, and Admiral Yi Sun-sins successor, Yi Si-eon, constructed Jinnamgwan Hall, a large <em>gaeksa</em> (government officer guesthouse) at the site in 1599.<br /><br />Jinnamgwan Hall is a single-story gable-roofed building with 15 <em>kan</em> (traditional Korean measurement between two pillars) on the front and 5 kan on the sides. It is the largest single-story goverment building from the Joseon dynasty in the region. At the hall entrance is a small museum outlining the history of Jinnamgwan and the Imjin War, and the famous Yeosu Stone Statue (Jeollanam-do Tangible Cultural Asset) is located within the precincts of the hall. Nearby attractions include Jasan Park, Odongdo Island, Dolsan Bridge, Chungminsa Shrine, and Manseongni Beach.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-61-659-4756|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Winter 09:00-17:00<br>Summer 09:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Cultural tourism interpretation services available (English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>* Advanced reservation required.|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-02-05-1675571940772/600668_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-05-1675571940772/600668_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-05-1675571940772/1607857_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-05-1675571940772/1607857_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-05-1675571940772/1607858_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-05-1675571940772/1607858_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-05-1675571940772/1607864_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-05-1675571940772/1607864_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-05-1675571940772/1607865_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-05-1675571940772/1607865_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-05-1675571940772/193552_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-05-1675571940772/193552_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-05-1675571940772/2367369_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-05-1675571940772/2367369_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-05-1675571940772/1607859_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-05-1675571940772/1607859_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-05-1675571940772/1607860_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-05-1675571940772/1607860_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-05-1675571940772/1607861_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-05-1675571940772/1607861_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-61-659-4756](tel:+82616594756)\n- [🏠tour.yeosu.go.kr</a><br /> <a href=\"http://www.heritage.go.kr/heri/cul/culSelectDetail.do?ccbaCpno=1113603040000&pageNo=1_1_1_1\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"새창: 문화재청 홈페이지로 이동\">www.cha.go.kr](http://www.yeosu.go.kr/tour/travel/10tour/jinnamgwan#noner)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 34.7418705464\nlongitude: 127.7367486187\ntitle: 11, Dongmun-ro, Yeosu-si, Jeollanam-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2023-02-05-1675571940772","title":"Jinnamgwan Hall (여수 진남관)","description":"Jinnamgwan Hall (National Treasure) is located at the site of the Jeolla Province naval base during the Joseon dynasty.
