This group of mountains is uniquely covered with reeds. Gajisan Mountain is the tallest of this group, rising above mountains almost 1,000 meters high. <br><br> An attraction of hiking in Gajisan Mountain is that various large, oddly shaped rock peaks can be seen from the mountain trail. To the east of the mountain is Seongnamsa Temple built during the Silla Kingdom. Today, only Buddhist nuns remain, but there are relics like the stupa of Seongnamsa Temple (Treasure) and a three-story stone pagoda.","regDate":"2022-08-21","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Ulsan","Nature","Natural Sites","Provincial Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-21-1661055031124/1144544_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Ulsan/2022-08-21-1661055031124"},{"id":"2022-08-20-1660984955279","title":"Taehwagang River (태화강)","description":"Taehwagang River cuts across the city of Ulsan from the west to east and originates from Tapgolsaem Spring on Baegunsan Mountain. The 47.54-kilometer-long river passes through downtown Ulsan and empties out into Ulsan Bay on the East Sea. Not just a symbol of pride for the people of Ulsan, the river has long since been a precious commodity that has played a pivotal role in Ulsan culture and history. There are several attractions and amenities near the river such as a bamboo forest park, grassy fields, a pampas grass colony, trails, and exercise facilities. The river itself is home to many freshwater fish, while the riverside area is a famous habitat for migratory birds.","regDate":"2022-08-20","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Ulsan","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-20-1660984955279/2617084_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Ulsan/2022-08-20-1660984955279","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Ulsan/2022-08-20-1660984955279"},{"id":"2022-08-20-1660977784342","title":"Taehwagang National Garden (태화강 국가정원)","description":"The Taehwagang River cuts across the heart of Ulsan and flows into Ulsan Bay, which is connected to the East Sea. The river basin, which stretches 36 kilometers from east to west and 28 kilometers from north to south, is mostly comprised of mountainous terrain, but there is fertile land on both sides of the river and at the southern end of the river. The river is presently an important source of drinking water for the citizens of Ulsan. <br><br> The field around the midpoint of Taehwagang River was left abandoned for a long time before it was founded as Taehwagang National Garden, preserving nature while providing a resting spot to the citizens of Ulsan. The garden is over twice the size of Yeouido Park in Seoul, and consists of natural water and a lush bamboo forest, known as Simnidae Forest, along with canola and forage barley fields. Simnidae Forest was once in danger of demolition as part of the government's flood control plans but remains preserved thanks to community efforts. Preservation efforts led to turning the area into Taehwagang National Garden of today, which took place from 2004 to 2010.","regDate":"2022-08-20","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Ulsan","Nature","Natural Sites","Eco-Tourism Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-20-1660977784342/2653664_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Ulsan/2022-08-20-1660977784342","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Ulsan/2022-08-20-1660977784342"},{"id":"2022-08-20-1660973797364","title":"Sinbulsan Falls National Recreational Forest (국립 신불산폭포자연휴양림)","description":"Sinbulsan Falls National Recreational Forest, located at the foot of Sinbulsan Mountain, is noted for the Yeongnam Alps and the beautiful surrounding valleys.
