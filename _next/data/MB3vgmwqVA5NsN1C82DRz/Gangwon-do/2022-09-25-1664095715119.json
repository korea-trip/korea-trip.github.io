Starting at Mureung Rock, a wide sheet of single rock on which hundreds can sit, the valley trail twists and turns as it passes Samhwasa Temple, Haksodae, Ongnyudong, and Seonnyeotang Ravine, all the way to Ssangpokpo and Yongchupokpo Falls, providing breathtaking scenery along the way. Also known as Arcadia, scholars and poets frequented the valley in times past, and the 5,000 square meters of Mureung Rock bears the inscribed names of some of these poets and their work.
