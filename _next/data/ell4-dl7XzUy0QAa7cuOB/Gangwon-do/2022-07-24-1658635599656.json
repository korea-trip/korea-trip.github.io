It is here that Jeongseon Arirang, the No. 1 Intangible Cultural Asset of Gangwon-do, originated. The area has long been famous for its beautiful, clean mountains and rivers. Its name is derived from the Korean word <em>eoureojida,</em> meaning \"to meet\" as the waters of Pyeongchang and Samcheok unite in this area.<br>\n<br>Part of the upper stream of Namhangang River, Auraji was a famous starting point of log rafts transporting timber to Hanyang, the original name of Seoul. In the old days, one could always hear the singing of boatmen who came from all over the nation. The lyrics of Jeongseon Arirang reveal the sadness and longing of a woman awaiting her husband who left for business to a far-away place or left to transport timber.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(English, Korean, Japanese, Chinese)<br>‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-1544-9053|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-24-1658635599656/1583475_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658635599656/1583475_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658635599656/175656_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658635599656/175656_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658635599656/179487_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658635599656/179487_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658635599656/179492_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658635599656/179492_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658635599656/2365263_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658635599656/2365263_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658635599656/2365265_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658635599656/2365265_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658635599656/2395942_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658635599656/2395942_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658635599656/2395943_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658635599656/2395943_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-1544-9053](tel:+8215449053)\n- [üè†www.ariaritour.com](http://www.ariaritour.com)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.4758305379\nlongitude: 128.7239879300\ntitle: 69, Auraji-gil, Jeongseon-gun, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Dong Seoul Bus Terminal, take a bus to Jeongseon Bus Terminal.<BR>From Jeongseon Bus Terminal Bus Stop, take a local bus bound for Yeoryang.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-24-1658635599656","title":"Auraji Lake (ÏïÑÏö∞ÎùºÏßÄ)","description":"Auraji is the name of a lake located in Yeoryang-myeon in Jeongseon-gun.
