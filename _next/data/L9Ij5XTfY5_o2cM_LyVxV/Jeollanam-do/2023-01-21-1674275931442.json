The temple was destroyed during the Imjin War (1592-1598) and the Korean War. In spite of the damage, the temple has continued to house two national treasures and four treasures. Starting from March 1, 1981 with the original Beopdang Hall,  the temple began to be rebuilt due to the efforts of the leading monk at the time, Chang Sungbu.<br><br>Acording to legend, Yeongi discovered a pond in the current sanctuary area when reading about the lands topography. While he was looking at the middle of the pond, one swallow flew from a whirlpool. After that, the pond began to dry up and the place was then used  for the temple. As such, the name Yeongok refers to the phenomenon of Yeon, a swallow, and Gok, a valley. There is a memorial plaque for Go Gwang-sun, a patriotic leader who fought against Japanese power during the Japanese colonization period while taking shelter at Yeongoksa Temple\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br>• For more info: +82-61-782-7412|\n|parking:|Available (limited space)|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Parking Fees:|Large-sized cars - 7,500 won|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-01-21-1674275931442/1606836_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-21-1674275931442/1606836_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-21-1674275931442/1606837_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-21-1674275931442/1606837_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-01-21-1674275931442/1606839_image2_1.webp](/2023-01-21-1674275931442/1606839_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-61-782-7412](tel:+82617827412)\n- [🏠www.yeongoksa.kr](http://www.yeongoksa.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.2544936804\nlongitude: 127.5877402048\ntitle: 774, Piagol-ro, Gurye-gun, Jeollanam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>\nFrom Seoul Nambu Terminal, take an intercity bus to Gurye Bus Terminal <br>\nFrom Gurye Bus Terminal, take a nonstop bus bound for Piagol Valley and get off at Pyeongdo Bus Stop. <BR>\nWalk for approx. 1.2 km to the temple.\n","data":{"id":"2023-01-21-1674275931442","title":"Gurye Yeongoksa Temple (연곡사 (구례))","description":"Yeongoksa Temple is located in Naedong-ri, Gurye-gun and was constructed in 543 by Yeongi, a high Buddhist monk, who also helped create Hwaeomsa Temple.
