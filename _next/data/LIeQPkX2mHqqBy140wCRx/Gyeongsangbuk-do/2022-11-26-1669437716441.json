According to Samguksagi (Historical records of the Three Kingdoms) and Samgungnyusa (Memorabilia from the three dynasties), Park Hyeokgeose, the founding monarch of Silla, was born by this well. In 69 BC, Sobeolgong, the head of Goheochon Village, saw a white horse on its knees by the well. When he approached the well he found that the horse had magically disappeared and that a large egg was left in its place, from which a boy was born. When the boy turned 13 years old (57 BC), he was appointed king by the village chiefs and began to rule the area then called ‚ÄòSeorabeol‚Äô. A memorial stone (2.25 meters high, 45 centimeters long, and 21 centimeters wide) was erected in 1803 in the third year of King Sunjos rule (Joseon dynasty) detailing the historical origins of the founding father of Silla.","regDate":"2022-11-28","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-28-1669628257001/681164_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-11-28-1669628257001"},{"id":"2022-11-28-1669624954858","title":"Gyeongju Hwangnyongsa Temple Site (Í≤ΩÏ£º Ìô©Î£°ÏÇ¨ÏßÄ)","description":"Hwangnyongsa Temple Site is located in front of Bunhwangsa Temple in Guhang-dong, Gyeongju. During the Silla Era, the Hwangnyongsa Temple was the nation‚Äôs largest temple and housed the bulk of the country‚Äôs major Buddhist treasures. <br> <br> Construction of the temple began in 553 on a field east of the royal compound under the commission of King Jinheung. The king originally planned to build a palace, but decided to build a temple instead, after receiving reports that a yellow dragon had been spotted on the building site. The temple was thus named Hwangnyongsa (Temple of Yellow Dragon) and was completed in 569, seventeen years after construction began. The temple murals featured an old pine tree drawn by Artist Solgeo. During the Silla Era, the temple was the center of state-sanctioned Buddhism. <br> <br>Later, when monk Jajang was studying in China during the Tang dynasty, he came across a god as he was passing by Taihe Pond. The god said to him, ‚ÄúThe yellow dragon, which is my eldest son, is guarding Hwangnyongsa Temple upon orders of Brahma, the Creator. If you build a nine-story pagoda upon your return to Silla, the neighboring states will surrender and pay tribute, and the royal cause will be stronger. Once the construction of the pagoda is complete, prepare a memorial service for the local gods and pardon any of the countrys criminals. If you follow all I have told you, no other state will dare invade Silla.‚Äù <br><br> After this encounter, Jajang returned to Silla and convinced Queen Seondeok to build the nine-story pagoda. Master architect Abiji of the neighboring state Baekje designed the pagoda and the project was built by Yongchun and 200 men using wood and stone. The night before the columns were to be erected, Architect Abiji of Baekje dreamed of the fall of Baekje and refused to complete the project. With a peal of thunder, an old monk and a man of great strength suddenly appeared from the temples main hall, erected the columns, and magically disappeared. Abiji was so shocked at the sight that he accepted his country‚Äôs future demise as the fate of the gods and once again restarted work on the temple. (From Samgungnyusa, the Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms) <br> <br> In the twenty-three years following the completion of the pagoda, Queen Seondeok unified the Three Kingdoms; later, numerous scholars pointed to the pagoda as a contributing factor in the unification. Of the three treasures of Silla, two were located at Hwangnyongsa Temple. The largest bell of Silla was also in the temple, but was taken away during the Mongol invasion. The highest monks of Silla preached at the temple, and many kings came to listen to the Buddhist teachings. <br><br> During excavation work in July 1969, the massive foundation stones of the sermon hall, auditorium, and pagoda were found. Eight years of archaeological excavations and studies revealed the unique layout of the temple grounds, which consisted of one pagoda and three halls; also found were 40,000 or so ancient artifacts. Though foundation stones and other structures from the bottom of the temple were identified through excavation, there are no historical clues about the temple‚Äôs upper design, making the restoration of the temple in its entirety practically impossible. The size of the temple, based on archeological findings, was about 70 acres, roughly eight times larger than that of Bulguksa Temple.","regDate":"2022-11-28","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Holy Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-28-1669624954858/202492_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-11-28-1669624954858"},{"id":"2022-11-28-1669620988479","title":"Gyeongju Historic Area [UNESCO World Heritage] (Í≤ΩÏ£ºÏó≠ÏÇ¨Ïú†Ï†ÅÏßÄÍµ¨ [Ïú†ÎÑ§Ïä§ÏΩî ÏÑ∏Í≥ÑÎ¨∏ÌôîÏú†ÏÇ∞])","description":"The Gyeongju Historic Area, registered as a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage on November 2000, is an area that embodies the time-honored history and culture of Gyeongju, the ancient capital of the Silla Kingdom (57 BC-AD 935).<br><br>The Gyeongju Historic Area can be divided into 5 major sections.

The forest is thickly populated by ancient zelkova and willow trees rooted on gently sloping hills and along the small stream in the northwest part of the woods. According to legend, the forest is closely associated with myths surrounding the birth of Alji, the founder of the Gyeongju Kim clan. As such, it is designated national Historic Site No. 19. <br>Legend has it that King Talhae heard a rooster crying from deep inside the Sirim Woods. Chancellor Hogong was sent to investigate. Upon arriving, he found a rooster crying underneath a tree on which hung a golden box. Hogong immediately reported his find to the king, who instructed him to bring the golden box into the palace. The king opened the box and found a small child inside, Kim Alji. The forest, which had previously been called ‚ÄòSirim‚Äô or ‚ÄòGurim‚Äô, became known as ‚ÄòGyerim‚Äô, (gye‚Äô meaning rooster). The name Gyerim was also used to refer to the Silla kingdom. <br>Alji was adopted as the king‚Äôs son, but because the crown was passed on to King Pasa of the Park family, he never ascended the throne. The Kim clan later became the royal bloodline with the coronation of King Naemul some years later. <br> The memorial stone recording the birth of Kim Alji was erected in the third year of King Sunjos rule in the Joseon dynasty. Located close to the royal fortress of Silla, the forest is still deeply revered as the mystical birthplace of the first ancestor of the royal Kim clan of Silla. Yellow canola blossoms along the path connecting Daereungwon with Gyerim and Banwolseong only add to the magical ambiance of the forest.","regDate":"2022-11-28","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-28-1669613785218/2493186_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-11-28-1669613785218"},{"id":"2022-11-28-1669610583651","title":"Gyeongju Golgulsa Temple (Í≥®Íµ¥ÏÇ¨ (Í≤ΩÏ£º))","description":"Located at the foot of Hamwolsan Mountain, Golgulsa Temple houses twelve caves in a tall cliff, with a rock-carved statue of Buddha sitting at the highest point.

Some caves are very small, large enough to allow only one person to sit in, while some are spacious enough to provide room for three to four people. From statues of young monks to old and wise monks, a variety of rock-carved sculptures can be seen placed throughout the caves.
