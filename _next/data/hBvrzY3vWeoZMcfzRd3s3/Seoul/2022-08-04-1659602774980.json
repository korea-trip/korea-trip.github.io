The eastern foot of the mountain has many scenic spots with its distinctively cozy and tasteful atmosphere, and the northern area called Mugye-dong also offers beautiful scenery. Inwangsa Temple was established in the early Joseon period (1392-1910) to guard the national palace Gyeongbokbung. The temple is comprised of 11 shrines from five different Buddhist orders. The unique design of each shrine adds pleasure to hikers on their way up to Seonbawi, an unusual rock formation that is a site of many folk beliefs and shamanist rites.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-2-737-4434|\n|restdate:|N/A (open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Not available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-04-1659602774980/1568100_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659602774980/1568100_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659602774980/2530864_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659602774980/2530864_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659602774980/2530869_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659602774980/2530869_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659602774980/2530871_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659602774980/2530871_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659602774980/2530873_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659602774980/2530873_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659602774980/2530875_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659602774980/2530875_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659602774980/2530876_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659602774980/2530876_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659602774980/2531115_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659602774980/2531115_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659602774980/2531116_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659602774980/2531116_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659602774980/1568098_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659602774980/1568098_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-2-737-4434](tel:+8227374434)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5786358368\nlongitude: 126.9597168346\ntitle: 16-1, Tongil-ro 18ga-gil, Jongno-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway]<br>\nDongnimmun Station (Seoul Subway Line 3), Exit 2.<br><br>\n\n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Seoul Station (Seoul Subway Line 1), Exit 9-1, take Bus No. 701, 703, or 704 and get off at Dongnimmun Station, Hansung Science High School Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-04-1659602774980","title":"Inwangsa Temple (인왕사 (서울))","description":"Inwangsa Temple refers to the entire cluster of small Buddhist temples located on Inwangsan Mountain (alt. 338m) in the heart of Seoul.
