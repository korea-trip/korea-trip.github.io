Luckily, the building was restored in May of 2011, \nand it became open to the public. The house was originally built in the 1600s by Kim Jeongseung, and subsequently lived in by  Song Jeongseung, and then Min Jeongseung, gaining the house the nickname of \"Samjeongseong House,\" meaning the house of three Jeongseong's. \n(The Jeongseong's rank is similiar to that of prime minister's today.)<br><br>\nBefore Mrs. Yuk Young-soo was born, the house was bought in 1918 from the sons of Min Jeongseung by Yuk Jong-gwan, and then repaired in the likeness of a typical Chungcheong <i>yangban</i> (noble \nclass) house from the late Joseon period. After entering through the main gate, the large site features a meeting room, outer room, inner room, backroom, servants quarters, annex, back garden, arbor, and lotus pond.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>• For more info: +82-43-730-3417|\n|parking:|Available (200m away)|\n|restdate:|Mondays, New Year's Day, Seollal (Lunar New Year's Day) and Chuseok (Korean Thanksgiving Day) holidays|\n|usetime:|Tues.-Sun. 09:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Free|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-26-1658820864445/1953557_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-26-1658820864445/1953557_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-26-1658820864445/1953558_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-26-1658820864445/1953558_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-26-1658820864445/1953559_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-26-1658820864445/1953559_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-26-1658820864445/1953560_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-26-1658820864445/1953560_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-26-1658820864445/1953561_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-26-1658820864445/1953561_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-26-1658820864445/1953562_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-26-1658820864445/1953562_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-26-1658820864445/1953563_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-26-1658820864445/1953563_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-26-1658820864445/1953567_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-26-1658820864445/1953567_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-26-1658820864445/1953569_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-26-1658820864445/1953569_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-43-730-3417](tel:+82437303417)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.3179146226\nlongitude: 127.5877785734\ntitle: 119 Hyangsu-gil, Okcheon-eup, Okcheon-gun, Chungcheongbuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \nFrom Dong Seoul Bus Terminal, take a bus to Okcheon Intercity Bus Terminal.
