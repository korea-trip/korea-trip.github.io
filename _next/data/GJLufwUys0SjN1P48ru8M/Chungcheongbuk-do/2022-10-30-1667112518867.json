It supplies water to around 289.4 jeongbos (unit) of farmland and was one of the 3 major reservoirs of the Three Kingdoms Era along with Byeokgolje of Gimje and Susanje of Miryang.

Attractions around the reservoir include Yeonghojeong Pavilion (erected in 1807 in the 7th year of King Sunjo) and Gyeonghoru Pavilion (built in 1948).

Nearby attractions include the Pine Field Park, National Archery Field, and Parkland.<br><br>Among the local specialties of the region are Gongeo fish which can only be seen during the spawning season that takes place during early spring.
