After the war, the temple suffered serious damage and was often the target of theft. <br> <br>Starting in 1920, the temple has undergone continual restoration work. The temple now holds seven national treasures, a number of additional important heritages, and was designated a World Cultural Heritage Site along with the nearby Seokguram Grotto by UNESCO in December 1995.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-54-746-9913|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n|usetime:|Weekdays 09:00-17:00<br>Weekends and public holidays 08:00-17:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Cars: 1,000 won / Buses: 2,000 won|\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals: Adults 6,000 won / Teenagers 4,000 won / Children 3,000 won / Preschoolers 2,000 won <br>Groups: Teenagers 3,500 won / Children 2,500 won <br><br>* Adults (ages 19 & over) / Teenagers (ages 13-18) / Children (ages 7-12) / Preschoolers (ages under 7)* Groups: 20 or more|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Available (Inquire in advance)|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-27-1669531284691/1954568_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-27-1669531284691/1954568_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-27-1669531284691/2367738_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-27-1669531284691/2367738_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-27-1669531284691/2367741_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-27-1669531284691/2367741_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-27-1669531284691/2640463_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-27-1669531284691/2640463_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-27-1669531284691/2640464_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-27-1669531284691/2640464_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-27-1669531284691/2678602_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-27-1669531284691/2678602_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-27-1669531284691/2678603_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-27-1669531284691/2678603_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-27-1669531284691/2678606_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-27-1669531284691/2678606_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-27-1669531284691/2367739_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-27-1669531284691/2367739_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-27-1669531284691/2367740_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-27-1669531284691/2367740_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-54-746-9913](tel:+82547469913)\n- [🏠www.bulguksa.or.kr</a><br><a href=\" https://www.templestay.com/temple_info.asp?t_id=bgs9913 \" target=\"_blank\">www.templestay.com](http://www.bulguksa.or.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.7892734269\nlongitude: 129.3318475148\ntitle: 385, Bulguk-ro, Gyeongju-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-27-1669531284691","title":"Gyeongju Bulguksa Temple [UNESCO World Heritage] (경주 불국사 [유네스코 세계문화유산])","description":"Bulguksa Temple is a representative relic of Buddhist culture from the Silla kingdom.

Although the building structures do not carry significant meaning in architectural aspect, the distinguished space arrangement of the buildings is hard to go unnoticed.

The city of Goryeong played such a central role in the development of the confederacy that many artifacts and historic sites of the Daegaya period can still be found there today. <br><br>Some of the most prominent landmarks are the 200 gobuns (ancient tombs) that lie along the southeastern slope of Jusan Mountain in Goryeong. In ancient times, the higher and larger a tomb, the higher the social status of the person buried inside. Given this tradition and historical evidence, the largest tomb in the south has been identified as Geumnim Wangneung (Royal Tomb of King Geumnim); the other large tombs are also presumed to be those of the kings of Daegaya. The large royal tombs (over 20m in diameter) dominate the mountain ridge (the highest point) while mid-sized and smaller tombs can be found on the mountain slopes and foothills. <br><br>Historical research on Daegaya began with the excavation and partial identification of the ancient tombs of Goryeong by research teams from Kyungpook National University and Keimyung University in 1977. Excavators discovered a great number of relics—gilt-bronze crowns, swords, armor, and trinkets of gold, silver, and jade—that shed light on the flourishing culture of Gaya. <br><br>To continue to encourage interest in the history and culture of Daegaya, officials of Goryeong-gun County established the Daegaya Royal Tomb Exhibit Hall at the foot of Jusan Mountain in Gobun-gun, Jisan-dong. The exhibition hall depicts the social structure of the era through ancient customs such as burying servants alive with their dead masters.","regDate":"2022-12-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-12-1670820019777/1004711_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-12-1670820019777"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
