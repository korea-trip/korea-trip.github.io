The house was created by Sin Han-tae during the reign of King Sukjong (1674-1720) of the Joseon dynasty. Since its construction centuries ago, the house has been inhabitated by the descendants of Sin Deuk-cheong, the 15th eldest grandson of General Sin Sung-gyem. This house has all of the features of an upper–class house of the Joseon period. The buildings of the house are built in a rectangular shape, with the courtyard in the center. The compound consists of Soteuldaemun (high-rising gate), Haengrangchae (servants’ quarters located next to the gate), Gotgan (storeroom in which grain and other items were stored), Anchae (room for the female family members) and a pavilion.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-54-870-6247|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-01-1669866657202/187513_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-01-1669866657202/187513_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-01-1669866657202/187514_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-01-1669866657202/187514_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-01-1669866657202/2533764_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-01-1669866657202/2533764_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-01-1669866657202/2533765_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-01-1669866657202/2533765_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-01-1669866657202/2533766_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-01-1669866657202/2533766_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-01-1669866657202/2533767_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-01-1669866657202/2533767_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-01-1669866657202/2533769_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-01-1669866657202/2533769_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-01-1669866657202/2533770_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-01-1669866657202/2533770_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-01-1669866657202/2533771_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-01-1669866657202/2533771_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-01-1669866657202/2533768_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-01-1669866657202/2533768_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-54-870-6247](tel:+82548706247)\n- [🏠www.cs.go.kr</a><br><a title=\"New window popup\" class=\"web\" href=\"http://www.cha.go.kr\">www.cha.go.kr](www.cs.go.kr/tour.web)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 36.4585389541\nlongitude: 129.0228304029\ntitle: 16, Jungdeul 2-gil, Cheongsong-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-01-1669866657202","title":"Head House of Pansagongpa Branch of Pyeongsan Sin Clan (청송 평산신씨 판사공파 종택과 분가 고택)","description":"Located in Cheongsong-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do Province, Head House of Pansagongpa Branch of Pyeongsan Sin Clan is the head house of the noble Pyeongsan Sin family line.

The city of Goryeong played such a central role in the development of the confederacy that many artifacts and historic sites of the Daegaya period can still be found there today. <br><br>Some of the most prominent landmarks are the 200 gobuns (ancient tombs) that lie along the southeastern slope of Jusan Mountain in Goryeong. In ancient times, the higher and larger a tomb, the higher the social status of the person buried inside. Given this tradition and historical evidence, the largest tomb in the south has been identified as Geumnim Wangneung (Royal Tomb of King Geumnim); the other large tombs are also presumed to be those of the kings of Daegaya. The large royal tombs (over 20m in diameter) dominate the mountain ridge (the highest point) while mid-sized and smaller tombs can be found on the mountain slopes and foothills. <br><br>Historical research on Daegaya began with the excavation and partial identification of the ancient tombs of Goryeong by research teams from Kyungpook National University and Keimyung University in 1977. Excavators discovered a great number of relics—gilt-bronze crowns, swords, armor, and trinkets of gold, silver, and jade—that shed light on the flourishing culture of Gaya. <br><br>To continue to encourage interest in the history and culture of Daegaya, officials of Goryeong-gun County established the Daegaya Royal Tomb Exhibit Hall at the foot of Jusan Mountain in Gobun-gun, Jisan-dong. The exhibition hall depicts the social structure of the era through ancient customs such as burying servants alive with their dead masters.","regDate":"2022-12-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-12-1670820019777/1004711_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-12-1670820019777"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
