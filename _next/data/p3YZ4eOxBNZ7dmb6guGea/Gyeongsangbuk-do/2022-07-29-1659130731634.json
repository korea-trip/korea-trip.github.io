The forest is composed of 100-year-old white pine trees brimming with pine nuts, along with pines and larches. In the forest, you can see the trees standing tall amidst the majestic rock formations. If you walk along the mountain trail, you will come to a suspension bridge, and after crossing, you will enter a section of forest that has maintained an old, almost primeval, feeling.\n<br><br>\nIn spring, beautiful wild flowers blossom throughout the forest, magnolias in particular, bloom within the valley. Cheongoksan National Recreational Forest features a variety of facilities such as a nearby water park, children’s playground, fitness center, campsite and an outdoor lecture field. The water in the water park is cold and very clean, using natural stream water. In nearby Baekcheongyegok Valley, you may also see Manchurian trout, which live in clean, fresh water streams. Hyeonbulsa Temple is also located in the valley.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|accomcount:|1,000 people a day|\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-54-672-1051|\n|opendate:|August 7, 1991|\n|parking:|Available|\n|usetime:|[Accommodations] Check in 15:00 / Check out 12:00<br>[General park hours] 09:00-18:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Individuals - Adults 1,000 won / Children 600 won / Preschoolers 300 won<br>Groups - Adults 800 won / Children 500 won / Preschoolers 200 won<br><br>* Adults (ages 19-64) / Children (ages 7-18) / Preschoolers (ages 6 and younger)<br>* Groups: 20 people or more<br>* Free admission December-March|\n|Available Facilities:|Accommodations, training facilities, outdoor facilities, etc.|\n|Facility Utilization Fees:|Varies by facility; please make an inquiry in advance.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Parking Fees:|Light-weight vehicles 1,500 won / Small & mid-sized vehicles 3,000 won / Large vehicles 5,000 won|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999491_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999491_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999492_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999492_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999493_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999493_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999495_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999495_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999497_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999497_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999498_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999498_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999499_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999499_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999500_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999500_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999502_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999502_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999503_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-29-1659130731634/1999503_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-54-672-1051](tel:+82546721051)\n- [🏠www.huyang.go.kr](http://www.huyang.go.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.0391887631\nlongitude: 128.9956517691\ntitle: 1552-163, Cheongok-ro, Bonghwa-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Train]<br>\nTake a train from Cheongnyangni Station to Taebaek Station.<br><br>\n\n[Taxi]<br>\nApprox. 25 min from Taebaek Station.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-29-1659130731634","title":"Cheongoksan National Recreational Forest (국립 청옥산자연휴양림)","description":"Cheongoksan National Recreational Forest is located in Bonghwa-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do.

The city of Goryeong played such a central role in the development of the confederacy that many artifacts and historic sites of the Daegaya period can still be found there today. <br><br>Some of the most prominent landmarks are the 200 gobuns (ancient tombs) that lie along the southeastern slope of Jusan Mountain in Goryeong. In ancient times, the higher and larger a tomb, the higher the social status of the person buried inside. Given this tradition and historical evidence, the largest tomb in the south has been identified as Geumnim Wangneung (Royal Tomb of King Geumnim); the other large tombs are also presumed to be those of the kings of Daegaya. The large royal tombs (over 20m in diameter) dominate the mountain ridge (the highest point) while mid-sized and smaller tombs can be found on the mountain slopes and foothills. <br><br>Historical research on Daegaya began with the excavation and partial identification of the ancient tombs of Goryeong by research teams from Kyungpook National University and Keimyung University in 1977. Excavators discovered a great number of relics—gilt-bronze crowns, swords, armor, and trinkets of gold, silver, and jade—that shed light on the flourishing culture of Gaya. <br><br>To continue to encourage interest in the history and culture of Daegaya, officials of Goryeong-gun County established the Daegaya Royal Tomb Exhibit Hall at the foot of Jusan Mountain in Gobun-gun, Jisan-dong. The exhibition hall depicts the social structure of the era through ancient customs such as burying servants alive with their dead masters.","regDate":"2022-12-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-12-1670820019777/1004711_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-12-1670820019777"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
