The tomb is 21.9m in diameter and 7.7m high and is encircled by a stone fence decorated with twelve oriental zodiac images. The area is also home to a number of stone monuments that stand facing each other  Hwapyoseok (marking the border of the tomb), Muninseok (civil servant statue), Muinseok (military officer image statue) and Dolsaja (a stone lion that protects the tomb). Muinseok in particular is a favorite among visitors because of its exotic appearance. The statue is sometimes compared to a strong and charismatic person of Arabic or Persian descendant, much like the merchants who came to Silla in ancient times.<br><br> Gwaereung is styled after tombs of the Tang dynasty, but still retains all the characteristics typical of Silla tombs; namely, the stones around the tomb, the 12 oriental zodiac figures, the protective walls, and the decorative stonework.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-54-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-54-779-6100|\n|parking:|Available|\n|usetime:|09:00-17:00|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Parking Fees:|Free|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-12-07-1670395284321/219705_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-07-1670395284321/219705_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-07-1670395284321/219706_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-07-1670395284321/219706_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-07-1670395284321/219707_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-07-1670395284321/219707_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-07-1670395284321/530279_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-07-1670395284321/530279_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-07-1670395284321/1200399_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-07-1670395284321/1200399_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-07-1670395284321/1200403_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-07-1670395284321/1200403_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-07-1670395284321/1200408_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-07-1670395284321/1200408_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-07-1670395284321/1200409_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-07-1670395284321/1200409_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-07-1670395284321/1200413_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-07-1670395284321/1200413_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-12-07-1670395284321/1200393_image2_1.webp](/2022-12-07-1670395284321/1200393_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-54-779-6100](tel:+82547796100)\n- [🏠www.gyeongju.go.kr/tour](http://www.gyeongju.go.kr/tour)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.7593515686\nlongitude: 129.3196077722\ntitle: 139, Singyeipsil-gil, Gyeongju-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\nFrom Seoul Express Bus Terminal or Dong Seoul Bus Terminal, take a bus to Gyeongju Bus Terminal.<br>\nFrom Gyeongju Express Bus Terminal, take Bus No. 600, 605, 606, 607, 608, or 609 and get off at the enterance of Gwaereung Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2022-12-07-1670395284321","title":"Tomb of King Wonseong (경주 원성왕릉)","description":"The tomb of the King Wonseong, 38th king of the Silla Kingdom (785-798) in Oedong-eup, Wolseong-gun, Gyeongju is Historic Site No. 26.

The city of Goryeong played such a central role in the development of the confederacy that many artifacts and historic sites of the Daegaya period can still be found there today. <br><br>Some of the most prominent landmarks are the 200 gobuns (ancient tombs) that lie along the southeastern slope of Jusan Mountain in Goryeong. In ancient times, the higher and larger a tomb, the higher the social status of the person buried inside. Given this tradition and historical evidence, the largest tomb in the south has been identified as Geumnim Wangneung (Royal Tomb of King Geumnim); the other large tombs are also presumed to be those of the kings of Daegaya. The large royal tombs (over 20m in diameter) dominate the mountain ridge (the highest point) while mid-sized and smaller tombs can be found on the mountain slopes and foothills. <br><br>Historical research on Daegaya began with the excavation and partial identification of the ancient tombs of Goryeong by research teams from Kyungpook National University and Keimyung University in 1977. Excavators discovered a great number of relics—gilt-bronze crowns, swords, armor, and trinkets of gold, silver, and jade—that shed light on the flourishing culture of Gaya. <br><br>To continue to encourage interest in the history and culture of Daegaya, officials of Goryeong-gun County established the Daegaya Royal Tomb Exhibit Hall at the foot of Jusan Mountain in Gobun-gun, Jisan-dong. The exhibition hall depicts the social structure of the era through ancient customs such as burying servants alive with their dead masters.","regDate":"2022-12-12","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-12-12-1670820019777/1004711_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-12-12-1670820019777"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true}
