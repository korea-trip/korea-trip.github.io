{"pageProps":{"content":"\n\n  \n## Overview\n\n> Cheongwansan Provincial Park is located on Cheongwansan Mountain, which is considered one of the best mountains in southwest Korea, along with Jirisan, Naejangsan, Wolchulsan and Naebyeonsan mountains. The name of Cheongwan comes from the fact that the surrounding boulders resemble a thorny crown worn by an emperor. In autumn, fields of silver grass unfold around the mountain peak, allowing for the Cheongwansan Silver Grass Festival to take place on Yeondaebong (silver grass plain). Also, from the top of the mountain, several grand landmarks like Dadohae archipelago, Wochulsan Mountain and Mudeungsan Mountain in nearby cities can be seen. On a clear day, visitors can even see Hallasan Mountain on Jeju Island. In the middle of the mountain is Cheongwansa Temple, which houses precious cultural properties including Cheongwansa Three-Story Pagoda (Treasure No. 795), Cheongwansa Seokdeung (stone lantern), Five-Story Pagoda, and Jangheung Tapsansaji Seokdeung (stone lantern).\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-61-867-7075|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|* Subject to abrupt closure due to adverse weather conditions.|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restricted Mountain Areas :|[Refer to the website.](http://hiking.kworks.co.kr/sub_map/map_user01.aspx)|\n|Mountain Not Access Period:|Seasonal Forest Fire Watches<br>Spring: February 2-May 15 <br>Autumn: November 1-December 15<br* Periods and areas are subject to change based on fire weather advisories, snow/precipitation levels, and other local conditions.|\n|Available Facilities:|[Convenience facilities]<br>Office, observatory, water fountain, pavilion, plaza, foot bathing, mineral spring, hiking trails<br><br>[Sports facilities]<br>Grass field, Jangcheongjae sports park<br><br>[Other]<br>Broadcasting facility, Sabang Dam, Jangcheonjae Pass, etc.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-61-867-7075](tel:+82618677075)\n- [üè†www.jangheung.go.kr](http://www.jangheung.go.kr/tour)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 34.5483645891\nlongitude: 126.9278437365\ntitle: Cheongwansan-gil, Jangheung-gun, Jeollanam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \nTake a bus bounded for Hoejin from Jangheung and get off at Gwansan Bus Stop.\n","data":{"id":"2023-02-02-1675334280408","title":"Cheongwansan Provincial Park (Ï≤úÍ¥ÄÏÇ∞ÎèÑÎ¶ΩÍ≥µÏõê)","description":"Cheongwansan Provincial Park is located on Cheongwansan Mountain, which is considered one of the best mountains in southwest Korea, along with Jirisan, Naejangsan, Wolchulsan and Naebyeonsan mountains.
