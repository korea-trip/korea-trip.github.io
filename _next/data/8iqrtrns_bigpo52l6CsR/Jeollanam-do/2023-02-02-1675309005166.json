The river starts from Yongchubong Peak (560m) located in Yong-myeon in Damyang, Jeollanam-do. It runs through Damyang, Gwangju, Naju, and Yeongam and eventually flows into the Yellow Sea in Mokpo through the estuary bank. <br><br>The river also faces some environmental challenges, including extreme weather events that cause flooding, leading to ecosystem loss and habitat degradation. In December 1981, a dam was built and the damage was significantly reduced. The government has also introduced the Four Major Rivers Restoration Project in 2009 with the objective of restoring the rivers while achieving regional development. Under this project, a significant amount of budget was allocated for resolving problems plaguing the Yeongsangang River.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>• For more info: +82-61-380-2820|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2023-02-02-1675309005166/2654751_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-02-1675309005166/2654751_image2_1.webp)\n![/2023-02-02-1675309005166/2654752_image2_1.webp](/2023-02-02-1675309005166/2654752_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-61-380-2820](tel:+82613802820)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.2772856399\nlongitude: 126.9472239597\ntitle: Gaedongsingi-gil, Damyang-gun, Jeollanam-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<BR>\nFrom Seoul Central City Bus Terminal, take a bus to Damyang Bus Terminal.<BR>From Damyang Bus Terminal Bus Stop, take Bus No. 322-1 and get off at Bongsan-myeon Bus Stop.
