It is a rapid means of traveling between downtown Sokcho and Abai Village along the 50 m-long waterway. This small barge-style boat without an engine can be run by pulling the wire manually. When fixing the solid steel wire on both sides of the waterway and pulling it hard with a hook, a boat moves forward slowly. As there is no boatman, passengers need to work together to move the boat. It takes about 5 min to cross the water by boat. This unique experience still attracts many tourists to Sokcho. Furthermore, it is known as the filming location for the Korean TV drama Autumn in My Heart, so many tourists from Japan and China visit the place.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|accomcount:|About 30 people|\n|infocenter:|‚Ä¢ 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br> ‚Ä¢ For more info: +82-33-635-2003|\n|parking:|Available (Capacity: about 50 small vehicles)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Film Locations:|\"Autumn in my Heart (2000)\"|\n|Facility Utilization Fees:|- Route: Cheongho-dong - Jungang-dong <br>- Operating hours: 04:30-23:00 <br>- Fare (one-way basis): Adults 500 won / Children 300 won / Handcart ¬∑ Bike 500 won|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-24-1658634922819/166463_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658634922819/166463_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658634922819/209268_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658634922819/209268_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658634922819/209764_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658634922819/209764_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658634922819/209773_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658634922819/209773_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658634922819/483577_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658634922819/483577_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658634922819/483580_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658634922819/483580_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658634922819/677177_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658634922819/677177_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658634922819/677179_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658634922819/677179_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658634922819/677180_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658634922819/677180_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-24-1658634922819/677181_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-24-1658634922819/677181_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [‚òéÔ∏è+82-33-635-2003](tel:+82336352003)\n- [üè†www.abai.co.kr](http://www.abai.co.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 38.2028631815\nlongitude: 128.5922246895\ntitle: 39, Jungangbudu-gil, Sokcho-si, Gangwon-do\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus]<br>\n From Dong Seoul Bus Terminal or Seoul Express Bus Terminal, take an express bus to Sokcho Intercity Bus Terminal or Sokcho Express Bus Terminal.<br>\n - Walk approx. 10-15 min to Sokcho Harbor.<br> - The ferry dock is at the end of the harbor.\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-24-1658634922819","title":"Abai Village Ferry (ÏïÑÎ∞îÏù¥ÎßàÏùÑ Í∞ØÎ∞∞)","description":"Gaetbae (boat without engine) is an exotic means of transportation to cross the Abai Village at the mouth of Cheongchoho Lake.

The crystal clear waters of the Hantangang River wind around Goseokbawi Rock, a peculiarly shaped rock of about 10 meters tall that stands dominantly in the middle of the river. Goseokjeong Pavilion is a two-story tower-style pavilion that has an area of about 33 square meters, built halfway up the Hantangang River during the reign of King Jinpyeong (r. AD 579-632) of the Silla Kingdom. Today, Goseokjeong refers to the entire area around Goseokjeong Pavilion and the valley surrounding Goseok Rock. Designated as a Monument of Gangwon-do, the pavilion is known to have been one of the most favored places by King Jinpyeong of Silla Kingdom, and King Chungsuk of Goryeo dynasty. The area became all the more famous as the arena of Im Kkeok-jeong (?-1562), who was a legendary leader of a peasant rebellion in the early Joseon dynasty. <br><br>The pavilion was destroyed during the Korean War and restored in 1971 by community leaders in Cheorwon. Unfortunately, it was damaged once again by flood in 1996 and reconstructed the year after. There is a natural stone chamber inside Goseokbawi Rock that Im Kkeok-jeong used as a hiding place. On the opposite side, there are remains of a stone castle. Jiktang Waterfall is located about 2 kilometers up from this site, while Sundam Valley is situated about 2 kilometers in the downstream. Goseokjeong is a year-round tourist attraction with an extensive grass square and recreational facilities. It is also the starting point for DMZ tours as the Iron Triangle Battlefield Conservation Office is located here and in winter, visitors can enjoy migratory bird tour.","regDate":"2022-09-24","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Tourist Complexes"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-24-1664012586092/2567099_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-09-24-1664012586092"},{"id":"2022-09-24-1664009366328","title":"Gongjicheon Stream (Gold Scales Theme Street) (Í≥µÏßÄÏ≤ú(Ìô©Í∏àÎπÑÎäòÌÖåÎßàÍ±∞Î¶¨))","description":"The city of Chuncheon is surrounded by Uiamho, Chuncheonho, and Soyangho Lakes and is widely known as Lake City.
