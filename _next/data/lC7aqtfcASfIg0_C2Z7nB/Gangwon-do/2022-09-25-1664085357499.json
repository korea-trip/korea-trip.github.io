All the cafes here have glass windows or outdoor terraces in order to offer the best scenic view for customers. Each cafe has its own characteristic feature  a building that recalls Santorini in Greece, the skywalk observatory decorated with transparent glass in all directions, and distinctive photo zones.

The crystal clear waters of the Hantangang River wind around Goseokbawi Rock, a peculiarly shaped rock of about 10 meters tall that stands dominantly in the middle of the river. Goseokjeong Pavilion is a two-story tower-style pavilion that has an area of about 33 square meters, built halfway up the Hantangang River during the reign of King Jinpyeong (r. AD 579-632) of the Silla Kingdom. Today, Goseokjeong refers to the entire area around Goseokjeong Pavilion and the valley surrounding Goseok Rock. Designated as a Monument of Gangwon-do, the pavilion is known to have been one of the most favored places by King Jinpyeong of Silla Kingdom, and King Chungsuk of Goryeo dynasty. The area became all the more famous as the arena of Im Kkeok-jeong (?-1562), who was a legendary leader of a peasant rebellion in the early Joseon dynasty. <br><br>The pavilion was destroyed during the Korean War and restored in 1971 by community leaders in Cheorwon. Unfortunately, it was damaged once again by flood in 1996 and reconstructed the year after. There is a natural stone chamber inside Goseokbawi Rock that Im Kkeok-jeong used as a hiding place. On the opposite side, there are remains of a stone castle. Jiktang Waterfall is located about 2 kilometers up from this site, while Sundam Valley is situated about 2 kilometers in the downstream. Goseokjeong is a year-round tourist attraction with an extensive grass square and recreational facilities. It is also the starting point for DMZ tours as the Iron Triangle Battlefield Conservation Office is located here and in winter, visitors can enjoy migratory bird tour.","regDate":"2022-09-24","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gangwon-do","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Tourist Complexes"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-24-1664012586092/2567099_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gangwon-do/2022-09-24-1664012586092","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Gangwon-do/2022-09-24-1664012586092"},{"id":"2022-09-24-1664009366328","title":"Gongjicheon Stream (Gold Scales Theme Street) (공지천(황금비늘테마거리))","description":"The city of Chuncheon is surrounded by Uiamho, Chuncheonho, and Soyangho Lakes and is widely known as Lake City.
