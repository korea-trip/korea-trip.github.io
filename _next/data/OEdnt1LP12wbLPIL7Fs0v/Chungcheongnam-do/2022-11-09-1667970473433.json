Upon climbing to the top of the mountain, visitor can overlook the scenic West Sea.

To the northwest of the Huirisan Pine Tree Recreational Forest is Saindae. Legend goes that four generals used to play there. Indeed, there is a cliff (140m in x_height) just below Saindae where they were believed to do chin-ups. Naturally, people call the area Teokgeolijang (Chin-Up Spot). Traces of Munsusa Temple still remain below Munsubong although it was said to have been destroyed by a huge number of bedbugs. 500m from Munsubong to the south, horse riding trails of the four generals are dotted along the ridge; Malttongbawi (Horse Dung Rock), resembling horse droppings, is 500m from the peak to the southeast.<br><br>Below Munsubong are four large peaks where the four generals lived and 100 small rocks beneath them that were home to low ranking men commanded by the generals. Because of their unique shapes, those rocks form a scenic sight while hiking in Huirisan.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-41-953-2230|\n|opendate:|1999|\n|parking:|Available (60 parking spaces)|\n|usetime:|09:00-18:00<BR>* Accommodations: 15:00-13:00 (the following day)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Admission Fees:|Adults (ages 19-64): Adults 1,000 won / Groups 800 won <br>Teenagers (ages 13-18): Adults 600 won / Groups 500 won <br>Children (ages 7-12): Adults 300 won / Groups 200 won<br>* Groups of 20 people or more<BR>* Free admission during winter season (December-March)|\n|Facility Utilization Fees:|Forest Cabin: Low Season & Weekdays 40,000-110,000 won / Peak Season & Weekends 73,000-185,000 won<br><br>Lodging Complex:  Low Season & Weekdays 52,000-110,000 won / Peak Season & Weekends 94,000-185,000 won <br><br>Forest Training Center: Low Season & Weekdays 402,000 won / Peak Season & Weekends 550,000 won<br><br>Camping Deck: Low Season & Weekdays 7,000 won / Peak Season & Weekends 8,500 won<br>Camping site with camping cars (80 ㎡ and under): Low Season & Weekdays 16,000 won / Peak Season & Weekends 28,000 won <br>* Peak Season: July 15 - August 24 / Weekends: Friday, Saturday, Public Holidays<BR>* Parking fee for vehicle camping site, cabins and camping car sites will be waived. |\n|Parking Fees:|Compact cars: 1,500 won<br>Small & Mid-sized cars: 3,000 won<br>Large-sized vehicles: 5,000 won|\n|Available Facilities:|* Services and facilities: Parking lot, camping deck, hiking course, walking path, pavilion, grass field, etc.<br>* Amenities: Cooking site, shower booth, forest house<br>* Sports facility: Multi-purpose sports facility|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-11-09-1667970473433/217650_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-09-1667970473433/217650_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-09-1667970473433/2032733_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-09-1667970473433/2032733_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-09-1667970473433/2032734_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-09-1667970473433/2032734_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-09-1667970473433/2032735_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-09-1667970473433/2032735_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-09-1667970473433/2032736_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-09-1667970473433/2032736_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-09-1667970473433/2032737_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-09-1667970473433/2032737_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-09-1667970473433/2032738_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-09-1667970473433/2032738_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-09-1667970473433/2032739_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-09-1667970473433/2032739_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-09-1667970473433/2032740_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-09-1667970473433/2032740_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-11-09-1667970473433/217660_image2_1.webp](/2022-11-09-1667970473433/217660_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-41-953-2230](tel:+82419532230)\n- [🏠www.huyang.go.kr](http://www.huyang.go.kr)\n\n\n\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Bus + Taxi]<BR>\nFrom  Seoul Nambu Terminal, take a bus to Seocheon Intercity Bus Terminal.<br><br>From Seocheon Intercity Bus \nTerminal Bus Stop, take a bus bound for Chunjangdae Beach and get off at Jongcheon-myeon Bus Stop.<br>Take a taxi for approx. 10 min.\n","data":{"id":"2022-11-09-1667970473433","title":"Huirisan Pine Tree National Recreational Forest (국립 희리산해송자연휴양림)","description":"Surrounded by majestic pine trees, Huirisan Mountain boasts an outstanding landscape; there is a reservoir at the foot of the mountain.

There are few existing records that mention the temple’s beginning. Some suggest that it was built around AD 527 during the 5th year of Baekje King Seongwang’s reign, but there is little evidence to support this theory. The only reference alluding to a specific time is Yeojidoseo (Detailed Survey of Korean Geography published during the late Joseon dynasty). It states Jeongamsa Temples location as on Oseosan Mountain, and Oseosan Mountain being surrounded by Hongsan Mountain and Baegwolsan Mountain and intersected by Hongju, Gyeolseong, and Boryeong. This indicates the temple was recognized in the mid-18th century and around the same time, Garamgo (a book about temples, published in the late 18th century) also states that Jeongamsa Temple is located approximately 11 kilometers to the east of Gyeolseonghyeon. It is still uncertain whether the temple referred to is Jeongamsa Temple on Oseosan Mountain. <br>Some foundation stones within the temple site measure 70-80 centimeters on each side. These stones indicate that the old Buddhist shrine of Jeongamsa Temple was laid out with five <em>kan</em> (Korean unit of measurement indicating the space between two pilars) at the front and three kan on the side. Future archaeological studies will help identify the true history of Jeongamsa Temple.","regDate":"2022-11-20","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Temples"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Chungcheongnam-do/2022-11-20-1668919580082"},{"id":"2022-11-20-1668916695189","title":"Gongseri Catholic Church (아산 공세리성당)","description":"Gongseri Catholic Church was founded in 1894 as the main parish of the Daejeon diocese in Gongse-ri, Inju-myeon that connects Asanman Bay to Sapgyocheon Stream.

This was the first Catholic church in Chungcheongnam-do and the religion spread across Anseong, Onyang, and Dunpo to establish regional churches respectively.
