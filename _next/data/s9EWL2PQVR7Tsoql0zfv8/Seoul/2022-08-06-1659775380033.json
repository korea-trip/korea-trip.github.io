Originally, the fortress was 4km in circumference, but due to massive overflowing of Hangang River during flood season in 1925, most of the fortress was lost and only 2.7km of it remains. To the east of the fortress are 4 vestiges of the fortress gates. The remains from the prehistoric era through the  Samguk (Three States) era have been unearthed, indicating that this place was a residential area well before the Baekje Era. Through vigorous excavation, some people suggest that there used to be a  palace located here during the Baekje Era.","regDate":"2022-08-07","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Fortresses"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-07-1659840061906/566413_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-08-07-1659840061906"},{"id":"2022-08-07-1659834580035","title":"Olympic Park (Ïò¨Î¶ºÌîΩÍ≥µÏõê)","description":"Olympic Park is an impressive leisure facility in which historic remains from the Baekje era share space with modern, state-of-the-art sports stadiums, an eco-friendly forest, and spacious grass fields.
