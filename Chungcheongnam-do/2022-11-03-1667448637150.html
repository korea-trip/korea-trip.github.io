Miller purchased the land in 1962 and starting in 1970, many trees were planted in earnest. At that time, the park was only open to experts in related fields and members who helped fund the arboretum. In 2009, select sections of the arboretum were finally opened to the general public. The arboretum features more than 13,200 plants, including holly, magnolia, camelia, and maple trees, as well as five varieties of Rose of Sharon, the national flower.","regDate":"2022-11-02","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongnam-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Botanical Gardens"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-02-1667378919698/2653799_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Chungcheongnam-do/2022-11-02-1667378919698","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Chungcheongnam-do/2022-11-02-1667378919698"},{"id":"2022-11-02-1667374827719","title":"Buyeo Neungsan-ri Ancient Tombs [UNESCO World Heritage] (부여 능산리 고분군 [유네스코 세계문화유산])","description":"Hundreds of Baekje tombs are scattered across Buyeo.

It has a x_height of about 8.4 kilometers. The wall surrouned Busosanseong Fortress and extended to the city of Buyeo. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe wall is one of the oldest walls along with Naseong in Pyeongyang and it is estimated to have been built around 538, when the Baekje capital was changed from Woonjin (current Gongju) to Sabi (current Buyeo). The wall of the fortress starts from the site where Dongmun (East gate) was located to the area of Geumgang River, made by piling soil up. However, only a few traces remain of its former glory. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor now, it leaves a blurry trail including a 20 meter area to the east of Cheongsanseong Fortress, Dongmun Bridge from Seokmok-ri, and an area from Pilseobong Peak to Yeomchang-ri. While the outer wall is sharply sloped, the inner wall was built with a gentle slope to make it easier for horses to reach the guard posts on the top of the wall. Inside the fortress, the palace of Baekje, government offices, houses, temples, stores and protected facilities can be seen. The entire structure of Naseong Fortress features Geumgang River in the south and west sides, providing a natural double-defense system. The wall was one of the important outer defense facilities along with Cheongsanseong and Cheongmasanseong Fortresses.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* Area  554,591 ㎡","regDate":"2022-11-02","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Fortresses"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Chungcheongnam-do/2022-11-02-1667372047028","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Chungcheongnam-do/2022-11-02-1667372047028"},{"id":"2022-11-02-1667368710012","title":"Buyeo Muryangsa Temple (무량사(부여))","description":"Muryangsa Temple, located at the foot of Mansusan Mountain in Buyeo-gun, Chungcheongnam-do, is said to have been built during the reign of Silla King Munmu by national preceptor Beomil.
