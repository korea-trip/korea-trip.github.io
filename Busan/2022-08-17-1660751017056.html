Not only is it popular as the largest summer vacation spot, but it also attracts people even in spring, autumn and winter for its variety of festivals and events, such as the Busan International Film Festival, the International Yacht Race and the Haeundae Sunrise Festival. These festivals help keep Haeundae busy as a popular tourist site all year round. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWith Haeundae Beach at its center, Haeundae Special Tourist Zone offers diverse marine leisure activities and fresh seafood. The zone has transformed itself from a typical vacation spot into a destination where one can stay long-term while enjoying leisure activities and cultural events. Today, the zone attracts an increasing number of tourists from around the globe. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe zone not only has natural resources, such as Haeundae Beach, Dongbaekseom Island, Dalmaji Hill and sea water hot springs, but also a convention center and IT complex. Well-equipped with cultural facilities, including movie sets, art galleries and aquariums, it is a qualified destination for MICE (Meeting, Incentive tour, Convention and Exhibition) tourists. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe coastal drive course is another way to enjoy Haeundae Beach. Moontan Road, offering a grand night view and various walking trails, including Galmaet-gil lying along the coastline, should not be missed as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe skyline at Haeundae underwent a dramatic change with the advent of Centum City. At night, the city skyline that is brilliantly illuminated by the high-end residential/commercial buildings captivates travelers. Inside Centum City are luxury apartments and a grand shopping complex, including a department store and a retail outlet. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n* Current State of Haeundae Special Tourist Zone\u003cbr\u003e\n1) Districts Covered: Areas around Jung, Songjeong, Jaesong and U-dong (Centum City), Haeundae-gu, Busan\u003cbr\u003e\n2) Area: 6,225,000 ㎡ \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n* Tourist Attractions \u003cbr\u003e\nHaeundae and Songjeong Beach, Dongbaek Island, Oryukdo Island, Centum City, Aquarium, Haeundae Hot Springs, etc.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330\u003cBR\u003e (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) \u003cbr\u003e • For more info: +82-51-749-5700|\n|parking:|134 parking facilities are available at the department store, retail outlet and Haeundae Beach.|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Available Facilities:|Interpretation center, resort condominiums, family hotel, tourist hotel, tourist restaurant, souvenir shop, nightlife restaurant exclusively for foreigners, etc.|\n|Restrooms:|Available in the department store and the retail outlet inside Centum City and 17 public restrooms at Haeundae Beach are available.|\n|Interpretation Services Offered:|Interpretation centers provide interpretation service in English, Chinese and Japanese and multilingual travel handbooks.Staff at the department store in Centum City can speak simple English, Chinese or Japanese.|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-17-1660751017056/1804865_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-17-1660751017056/1804865_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-17-1660751017056/1804870_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-17-1660751017056/1804870_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-17-1660751017056/1804886_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-17-1660751017056/1804886_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-17-1660751017056/1877473_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-17-1660751017056/1877473_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-17-1660751017056/1877478_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-17-1660751017056/1877478_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-51-749-5700](tel:+82517495700)\n\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 35.1584383046\nlongitude: 129.1598690678\ntitle: Haeundae-gu, Busan\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway]\u003cBR\u003e\nHaeundae Station (Busan Subway Line 2).\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-17-1660751017056","title":"Haeundae Special Tourist Zone (해운대 관광특구)","description":"Haeundae Beach in Busan is famous both in Korea and abroad.
