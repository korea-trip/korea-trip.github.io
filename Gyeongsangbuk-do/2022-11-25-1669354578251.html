The first relic found in this tomb was a gold crown, \u003ci\u003egeumgwan\u003c/i\u003e, and so the tomb took its name. Ornaments such as gold belts, earings, bracelets, saddlers and crockery of the Three Kingdoms Era (when Goguryeo, Baekje and Silla were separated, later unified by Silla in 676 AD) were dug up from the tomb.
