When the allied forces of Baekje and Japan attacked, he asked Gwanggaeto the Great of Goguryeo for help and led the people to victory, contributing to the increased strength of the Silla Kingdom.

The edge of a natural stone is exposed around the bottom of the mound, pointing to the fact that the inner chamber tomb was made of stone. In the historical document Samguk Sagi (History of the Three Kingdoms), no records are found about the tomb, but the Samguk Yusa (Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms) describes the king’s tomb as being located in the southwest of Cheomseongdae, which is consistent with the tomb’s location.","regDate":"2022-11-29","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-29-1669700202072/1954895_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-11-29-1669700202072"},{"id":"2022-11-29-1669697007054","title":"Gyeongju Poseokjeong Pavilion Site (경주 포석정지)","description":"Poseokjeong Pavilion served as a separate palace where kings enjoyed banquets with nobles.

Based on Chinese writings from 353, it is said that drinking glasses were floated on the canal. One popular party game had guests creating poems before the glass had passed nine sections of the canel. Guests who could not do this had to drink three glasses.

This mountain boasts nearly 40 valleys winding down from Geumobong Peak (468 meters in elevation), Gowibong Peak (494 meters in elevation), and other surrounding peaks. Also, this 4-kilometer-wide and 8-kilometer-long oval-shaped mountain runs almost perfectly north to south.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNamsan Mountain is a veritable open-air museum, with 100 temple sites, 80 stone Buddha statues, and 60 stone pagodas scattered across the mountainside. Topographically, it features nearly 40 valleys and is divided into the Southwest Mountain, a sacred place during the Silla period, and the Southeast Mountain, where many Buddhas can be found around the valleys.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNajeong Well, at the western foot of Namsan Mountain, is the mythic birthplace of King Park Hyeokgeose, founder of the Silla Kingdom. The local Yangsanjae Shrine was built in honor of its founder who lived in Seorabeol before the Silla Kingdom was established. Poseokjeong Pavilion is the place where the glorious era of the Silla Kingdom came to an end. In the Southeast Mountain region, one can encounter the Stone Seated Buddha of Borisa Temple, a 9-meter-high Rock Buddha Statue at Bulmusa Temple, and a Stone Seated Stone Buddha at Gamsil Shrine. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNamsan Mountain also features 11 treasures, including Stone Seated Buddha of Mireukgol (Borisa Temple), Three-story Stone Pagoda of Yongjangsa Temple Site, the Rock-carved Buddha at Chilburam Hermitage, and others.

Numerous valleys, unique rock formations, and beautiful trails are abundant throughout the area. Many tourists say, “You cannot say that you know Gyeongju without hiking up Namsan Mountain.” Namsan Mountain is a place where the scenic nature and long history of the Silla Kingdom coexist, and also where the aesthetic consciousness and religious traditions of the Silla people evolved into the artform it is today.","regDate":"2022-11-28","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Nature","Natural Sites","Mountains"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-28-1669632048970/2037050_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-11-28-1669632048970"},{"id":"2022-11-28-1669628257001","title":"Gyeongju Najeong Well (경주 나정)","description":"To the southeast of the royal tomb, is a small monument that has been erected among the pine trees; next to the monument is a well called Najeong.

In 69 BC, Sobeolgong, the head of Goheochon Village, saw a white horse on its knees by the well. When he approached the well he found that the horse had magically disappeared and that a large egg was left in its place, from which a boy was born. When the boy turned 13 years old (57 BC), he was appointed king by the village chiefs and began to rule the area then called ‘Seorabeol’. A memorial stone (2.25 meters high, 45 centimeters long, and 21 centimeters wide) was erected in 1803 in the third year of King Sunjos rule (Joseon dynasty) detailing the historical origins of the founding father of Silla.","regDate":"2022-11-28","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-28-1669628257001/681164_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-11-28-1669628257001"},{"id":"2022-11-28-1669624954858","title":"Gyeongju Hwangnyongsa Temple Site (경주 황룡사지)","description":"Hwangnyongsa Temple Site is located in front of Bunhwangsa Temple in Guhang-dong, Gyeongju. During the Silla Era, the Hwangnyongsa Temple was the nation’s largest temple and housed the bulk of the country’s major Buddhist treasures. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e Construction of the temple began in 553 on a field east of the royal compound under the commission of King Jinheung. The king originally planned to build a palace, but decided to build a temple instead, after receiving reports that a yellow dragon had been spotted on the building site. The temple was thus named Hwangnyongsa (Temple of Yellow Dragon) and was completed in 569, seventeen years after construction began. The temple murals featured an old pine tree drawn by Artist Solgeo. During the Silla Era, the temple was the center of state-sanctioned Buddhism. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eLater, when monk Jajang was studying in China during the Tang dynasty, he came across a god as he was passing by Taihe Pond. The god said to him, “The yellow dragon, which is my eldest son, is guarding Hwangnyongsa Temple upon orders of Brahma, the Creator. If you build a nine-story pagoda upon your return to Silla, the neighboring states will surrender and pay tribute, and the royal cause will be stronger. Once the construction of the pagoda is complete, prepare a memorial service for the local gods and pardon any of the countrys criminals. If you follow all I have told you, no other state will dare invade Silla.” \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e After this encounter, Jajang returned to Silla and convinced Queen Seondeok to build the nine-story pagoda. Master architect Abiji of the neighboring state Baekje designed the pagoda and the project was built by Yongchun and 200 men using wood and stone. The night before the columns were to be erected, Architect Abiji of Baekje dreamed of the fall of Baekje and refused to complete the project. With a peal of thunder, an old monk and a man of great strength suddenly appeared from the temples main hall, erected the columns, and magically disappeared. Abiji was so shocked at the sight that he accepted his country’s future demise as the fate of the gods and once again restarted work on the temple. (From Samgungnyusa, the Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms) \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e In the twenty-three years following the completion of the pagoda, Queen Seondeok unified the Three Kingdoms; later, numerous scholars pointed to the pagoda as a contributing factor in the unification. Of the three treasures of Silla, two were located at Hwangnyongsa Temple. The largest bell of Silla was also in the temple, but was taken away during the Mongol invasion. The highest monks of Silla preached at the temple, and many kings came to listen to the Buddhist teachings. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e During excavation work in July 1969, the massive foundation stones of the sermon hall, auditorium, and pagoda were found. Eight years of archaeological excavations and studies revealed the unique layout of the temple grounds, which consisted of one pagoda and three halls; also found were 40,000 or so ancient artifacts. Though foundation stones and other structures from the bottom of the temple were identified through excavation, there are no historical clues about the temple’s upper design, making the restoration of the temple in its entirety practically impossible. The size of the temple, based on archeological findings, was about 70 acres, roughly eight times larger than that of Bulguksa Temple.","regDate":"2022-11-28","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Holy Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-11-28-1669624954858/202492_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeongsangbuk-do/2022-11-28-1669624954858"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/[...pid]","query":{"pid":["Gyeongsangbuk-do","2022-11-26-1669434104637"]},"buildId":"NnuJsfSZTfLXPUw2cc_0I","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
