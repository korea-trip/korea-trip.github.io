세계문화유산])","description":"Yungneung is the joint tomb of King Jangjo (1735-1762) and Queen Heongyeong (1735-1815). King Jangjo was the father of King Jeongjo, the 22nd ruler of the Joseon dynasty. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e King Jangjo was the second son of King Yeongjo, the 21st ruler of the Joseon dynasty. He was installed as Crown Prince in 1736. As the Crown Prince, he administered the state affairs on behalf of his father and showed great capability in various fields. However, he died in 1762 after being locked in a wooden rice chest by the orders of his father, King Yeongjo. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e The tomb of this ill-fated Crown Prince was originally located on Baebongsan Mountain in Yangju-gun, Gyeonggi-do. His son King Jeongjo moved the tomb to  Hwasan Mountain in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi-do and changed the title of the tomb to Hyeollyungwon. Later, he posthumously gave his father the title King Jangjo and moved the tomb to its current place, and the title of the tomb was changed again to Yungneung.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Queen Heongyeong was designated as a crown princess in 1744. In 1795 when she turned 60 and long after her husband died, she wrote Hanjungnok, The Memoirs, which is mainly about the terrible fate of her husband.\u003cbr\u003e The Memoirs have great historical significance, and these, along with the Tales of Queen Inhyeon, are highly valued as pieces of royal literature.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYungneung is currently located in Annyeong-dong in Hwaseong. A stone called “Byeongpungseok” surrounds the tomb. On the stone, peony and lotus flowers are engraved. Like other royal tombs, there are two separate spaces – one raised and one lower space. In the raised space, there is the mound, “Honyuseok,” which is a rectangular shaped stone sitting in front of the mound, and Mangjuseok, which is a pair of stones that sit on both sides of the mound. In the lower spaces, there are several stone statues. They include “Muninseok,” a statue of a civil officer, “Muinseok,” a statue of a military officer, and “Seokma,” a statue of a horse. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Geolleung is the joint tomb of King Jeongjo (1752-1800), the 22nd ruler of the Joseon dynasty, and Queen Hyoui (1753-1821). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e King Jeongjo’s last wish was to be buried near his father’s tomb in Yungneung. King Jeongjo was the second son of King Jangjo and Queen Heongyeong, but in 1759, when he was 8 years old, he was designated as the heir to the throne. During his 24 year-reign, King Jeongjo influenced state affairs by implementing the “Tangpyeongchaek (a policy to balance the power of political factions),” and he also had great accomplishments in the area of academic research by creating the “Gyujanggak (a national royal library).” \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Queen Hyoui was a daughter of Kim Si Muk and was installed as a partner of the heir to the throne at the age of 10. In 1776, when King Jeongjo ascended the throne, she also became Queen. She is known to have led a frugal life. In 1821, she died without an heir at the age of 69 in Jagyeongjeon, Changgyeonggung Palace. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Geolleung looks very similar to Yungneung, but unlike Yungneung, it does not have a “Byeongpungseok,” which is a wide and rectangular stone that surrounds the mound and protects it. Instead, it is surrounded by “Nanganseok,” stone handrails. On every handrail, lotus flowers are engraved. King Jeongjo’s tomb is simpler and less decorated than his father’s, which reflects King Jeongjo’s respect and love for his father. Both Geolleung and Yungneung are designated as Historic Site No. 206.","regDate":"2022-09-21","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-09-21-1663736793928","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Gyeonggi-do/2022-09-21-1663736793928"},{"id":"2022-09-20-1663670813897","title":"Yongsopokpo Falls (용소폭포)","description":"Three kilometers up Domachigyegok Valley from Sampalgyo Bridge, Yongsopokpo Falls flows peacefully into Yongso Pond.

He came to the throne at the age of 22. During his 32-year reign, he was very influential in the development of Korean culture. For example, King Sejong created the Korean alphabet, which he called Hunminjeongeum, and set up the Hall of Worthies (Jiphyeonjeon), an association of the kingdom’s brightest scholars. He also used Confucian principles to administer state affairs. Under the reign of King Sejong, therefore, many sectors including politics, economy, society and culture flourished.

In 1450 when King Sejong died, he was buried together with the dead queen.

Upon ascending to the throne, he devised a plan to conquer the northern region of Asia, including the Qing dynasty (part of China). As part of the plan, he reformed the military system and strengthened the army and military enforcements. King Hyojong had spent time in northern China when he was taken hostage by the Manchus. During that time he became exposed to many different cultures and technological advancements. When a group of Dutch sailors were shipwrecked on the Korean shore, King Hyojong ordered them to build the Korean army’s first muskets. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e King Hyojong also implemented “Daedongbeop,” a tax system under which people had to pay taxes with rice, and circulated “Sangpyeongtongbo,” the coinage of the Joseon dynasty.","regDate":"2022-09-20","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-09-20-1663660086765/2482766_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-09-20-1663660086765","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Gyeonggi-do/2022-09-20-1663660086765"},{"id":"2022-09-20-1663655587484","title":"Yeoju Silleuksa Temple (신륵사 (여주))","description":"Silleuksa Temple is located along the upper section of the Namhangang River as it flows from Bongmisan Mountain in Yeoju.
