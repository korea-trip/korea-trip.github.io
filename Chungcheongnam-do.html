The only reference alluding to a specific time is Yeojidoseo (Detailed Survey of Korean Geography published during the late Joseon dynasty). It states Jeongamsa Temples location as on Oseosan Mountain, and Oseosan Mountain being surrounded by Hongsan Mountain and Baegwolsan Mountain and intersected by Hongju, Gyeolseong, and Boryeong. This indicates the temple was recognized in the mid-18th century and around the same time, Garamgo (a book about temples, published in the late 18th century) also states that Jeongamsa Temple is located approximately 11 kilometers to the east of Gyeolseonghyeon.

The temple, which was founded during the\u0026nbsp;5th year of the Baekje Kingdom, has an interesting legend behind its origin. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAccording to the legend, an old monk fell asleep after praying under a large rock on the slopes of Seongheungsan Mountain. In his dream, a large bird glowing in gold  flew in from the west and sat on the rock where Daejosa currently stands. While the bird continuoulsy flapped its wings, a ray of light shone on the rock and it was there that the statue of Avalokitasvara Bodhisattva appeared. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe old monk had the same dream at the same time for many days. He recounted his dream to the seongju (castle lord), who then reported it to King Seong of Baekje. The king interpreted the dream as a sign that it was the right time to move the capital of Baekje to Sabi (now Buyeo) and ordered the construction of a large temple at the location that appeared in the dream. The temple was so big that even at a hurried pace, it would still take 10 years to build. Workers had to work day and night, and every time the workers felt tired, birds would come singing to brighten up the atmosphere so that the workers can forget the fatigue and continue working. Hence, the temple was completed after only\u0026nbsp;five years. Because of the golden bird, the temple was named Daejosa, literally meaning temple of a great bird.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e The rock on which Avalokitasvara Bodhisattva appeared in the dream was recreated as a stone statue of a Buddha. This standing stone Maitreya Bodhisattva statue is a fine work of sculpture which, along with the stone Bodhisattva of Gwanchoksa Temple (Treasure No. 218), is a representative heritage of the early Gorye period.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn front of Wontongbojeon Hall (a hall enshrining Avalokitasvara Bodhisattva) stands a pagoda.

The site was excavated 10 times between 1964 and 1974 by teams from Yonsei University Museum. The excavation of 27 layers of stratum produced relics proving people lived in the area through 11 cultural eras. The area was excavated again in 1990 and 1993, producing even more cultural artifacts and helping to create a clearer image of the people living in that time.","regDate":"2022-07-28","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongnam-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-28-1658984540847/531206_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Chungcheongnam-do/2022-07-28-1658984540847","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Chungcheongnam-do/2022-07-28-1658984540847"},{"id":"2022-07-28-1658981694068","title":"Anmyeondo Island Recreational Forest (안면도자연휴양림)","description":"Anmyeondo in Taean is home to a 100 year old pine tree forest that is special in Korea.

The peninsula connected to Nammyeon was isolated during the Joseon Dynasty by cutting off access between Changgi-ri in Anmyeon-eup and Shinon-ri in Nammyeon for the convenience of tax transportation. The island's coast is lined with some 14 beaches as well as abundant pine trees, which are symbols of Anmyeon-eup. The island also owns Anmyeondo Natural Forest, along with the Mogamju Forest (Natural Monument No. 138).","regDate":"2022-07-28","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Chungcheongnam-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-07-28-1658975944792/2426575_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Chungcheongnam-do/2022-07-28-1658975944792","pageUrl":"https:/mcdryad.com/Chungcheongnam-do/2022-07-28-1658975944792"}],"metaData":{"pageUrl":"https://mcdryad.com/Chungcheongnam-do","nav":"Chungcheongnam-do"},"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/[...pid]","query":{"pid":["Chungcheongnam-do"]},"buildId":"qSoKRyl6sW0EZkXcNFjn6","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
