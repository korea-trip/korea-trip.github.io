The water is said to be good for stomachaches, eye infections, and skin diseases; and, as it contains nine essential elements such as calcium and fluorine, it tastes crisp and clean. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scenic Beauty 2  Turtle Rock &lt;br&gt;Part of the path leading to Hwaam Mineral Spring is buttressed by a cliff, on which there is a rock that resembles the shape of a turtle. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Scenic Beauty 3  Yongmaso&lt;br&gt;With its clean water and wide sheets of rock, Yongmaso Lake is a popular attraction for vacationers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scenic Beauty 4  Hwaamdonggul Cave&lt;br&gt;Hwaamdonggul Cave used to be a gold mine that was commercially operated from 1922 to 1945. The nation’s 5th largest goldmine was, however, found to have natural stalactites, and later the cave was developed as the only theme-based cave that combined gold and nature. The stalactite area is an open space of 2,800㎡ and the length of the path open to visitors is 1,803 meters. The entire area consists of 5 chapters, which in turn constitute 41 zones; it takes about an hour and a half to see all of the zones. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scenic Beauty 5  Hwapyoju Cliff&lt;br&gt;Hwapyoju is a cliff facing the entrance of Hwapyo-dong, which can be seen on the way from Hwaam-dong to Molundae. The cliff may appear as if a giant sharpened a large sheet of rock and placed it upright, or less imaginatively, as if two pillars are standing side by side. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scenic Beauty 6  Sogeumgang River&lt;br&gt;The four-kilometer stretch from Hwapyoju to Molundae, surrounded with 100 to 150-meter high rock cliffs and thick forest, is called Sogeumgang River (small Geumgang River), meaning that its beautiful scenery is reminiscent of that of the breathtaking Geumgangsan Mountain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scenic Beauty 7  Molundae Cliff&lt;br&gt;Molundae literally means ‘the cliff beyond which clouds disappear’. The tip of the steep cliff is adorned with three specimens of 500-year-old pine trees. Legend has it that gods would perch on the cliff’s top and enjoy the beautiful view. At the foot of the cliff lies a large sheet of rock that can accommodate hundreds of people. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scenic Beauty 8  Gwangdaegok Valley&lt;br&gt;Gwangdaegok Valley is said to be the mysterious place where heaven, earth and clouds meet.

The stalactite area is an open space of 2,800㎡ and the length of the path open to visitors is 1,803 meters.

Its name, Jujeongol, is said to come from the Joseon-era bandits that are said to have settled in the area, making their living with counterfeit (ju) coins (jeon) while disguised as Buddhist monks. Osaek (meaning “five colors”) was inspired by the five colors of Jujeongol’s rock formations, and the five-colored tree that is said to have lived in Osaekseoksa Temple of the past. A 3.2 km-long trail brings visitors along the rising rocks next to the valley, connecting Seongguksa Temple and Seonnyeotang Pothole to Yongso Falls Information Center. It is a relatively flat, 1 hr-long course with many wooden decks that help to make it more accessible for the visitors. The entrance to the trail is the location of the Osaek Mineral Spring, whose natural carbonation and iron content impart a unique flavor in the water.
