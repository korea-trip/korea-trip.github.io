However, rites were again abolished in 1464 (10th year of King Sejo). It wasn’t until 1897 (34th year of King Gojong) when the Joseon dynasty was renamed as the Korean Empire and King Gojong ascended to emperor, that the rite was revived. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nNow, Hwangungu Shrine and three stone drums stand at the location of the former altar complex. The three stone drums symbolize the instruments used for the rites. The shrine was completed in 1899, two years after the altar was started in 1897. Today, the Hwangungu Shrine still stands within the hotel grounds of the Westin Chosun Hotel.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 \u003cbr\u003e(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) \u003cbr\u003e • For more info: +82-2-3396-5842|\n  \n\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-02-1659472861958/1570572_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659472861958/1570572_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659472861958/1570573_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659472861958/1570573_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659472861958/1570574_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659472861958/1570574_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659472861958/1570575_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659472861958/1570575_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-02-1659472861958/1570576_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-02-1659472861958/1570576_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-2-3396-5842](tel:+82233965842)\n- [🏠www.junggu.seoul.kr/tour\u003c/a\u003e (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\" http://www.cha.go.kr\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"web\"\u003ewww.cha.go.kr](http://www.junggu.seoul.kr/tour)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5651627568\nlongitude: 126.9794848592\ntitle: 112, Sogong-ro, Jung-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway]\u003cbr\u003e\nFrom City Hall Station (Seoul Subway Line 1 \u0026 2), Exit 5.\u003cbr\u003e\nWalk straight and cross the road at the intersection.\u003cbr\u003e\nCross the street on the right.\u003cbr\u003e\nThe entrance to Hwangudan Altar is on the left.\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-02-1659472861958","title":"Hwangudan Altar (환구단)","description":"Hwangudan Altar, also called Hwandan Altar, refers to an altar complex for the rite of heaven.
