It is a historic landmark that once contained several royal tombs, and was known at that time as Hyochangwon. The cemeteries that were originally located in Hyochangwon belonged to Crown Prince Munhyo, King Jeongjo’s first son who died at the age of five; Royal Noble Consort Uibin of the Seong Clan, King Jeongjo’s royal concubine and Crown Prince Munhyo’s mother; Royal Noble Consort Sugui of the Park Clan, King Sunjo’s royal concubine; and her daughter Princess Yeongon. The royal tombs were moved to Seooreung Tombs in the waning months of the Japanese colonial period. The Japanese empire began the development of Hyochangwon into a park in 1924, and the Japanese governor-general officially assigned the site as a park in 1940.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cBr\u003e\nPresently, several of Korea’s greatest leaders are buried in Hyochang Park. The remains mostly belong to independence activists including Yoon Bong-gil, Lee Bong-chang, and Baek Jeong-gi, whose graves are collectively known as Samuisa Tomb. A statue of Lee Bong-chang has been built in the graveyard. Among the other patriotic martyrs who are interred in the park are Kim Gu and some of the key figures of the provisional government such as Lee Dong-nyeong, Cha I-seok, and Cho Seong-hwan. An ancestral shrine named Uiyeolsa has been built along the main gate and holds the portraits of the deceased independence activists.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 \u003cbr\u003e(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) \u003cbr\u003e • For more info: +82-2-2199-8823|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Available Facilities:|Kim Koo Museum \u0026 Library, Anti-Communist Monument, statue of Lee Bong-chang, statue of Wonhyo, badminton court,  eco-experience center, children's playground, convenience store, drinking fountain, etc.|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-09-1660030622688/1568012_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-09-1660030622688/1568012_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-09-1660030622688/1568013_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-09-1660030622688/1568013_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-09-1660030622688/1568014_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-09-1660030622688/1568014_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-09-1660030622688/1568016_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-09-1660030622688/1568016_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-09-1660030622688/1568017_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-09-1660030622688/1568017_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-2-2199-8823](tel:+82221998823)\n- [🏠hyochangpark.com](https://hyochangpark.com/intro)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5450425860\nlongitude: 126.9634757763\ntitle: 177-18, Hyochangwon-ro, Yongsan-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-09-1660030622688","title":"Seoul Hyochang Park (서울 효창공원)","description":"Hyochang Park covers 122,245 square meters spanning across Hyochang-dong and Cheongpa 2-dong.

The park is located at what was originally the site of Wongaksa Temple, built during the 13th year of Joseon King Sejo's reign. However, the temple was destroyed and the site did not become a park until 1897 due to a proposal made by Englishman John Mcleavy Brown, an advisor to King Gojong. The park is also important for being the starting point for the March 1 Independence Movement in Seoul. The original name of the park was Pagoda Park, but was changed to the current Tapgol Park on May 28, 1992.
