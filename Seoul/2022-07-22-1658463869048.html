Although these high school students have aged, they continue to visit the area, reliving their youth and continuing to indulge in the specialty tteokbokki.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, some claim the history of this alley began in the 1950s. The owner of Mabongnim Halmeoni Tteokbokki restaurant says tteokbokki was being sold as early as 1953 as the area used to be home to Donga Theater and she sold tteokbokki, corn and potatoes to those visiting the theater. At first, tteokbokki was simply made with gochu jang but as time went by, cooks decided the dish could be more than just a snack. By adding ingredients like eggs, cellophane noodles, fish cakes, instant noodles and more recently squid, prawn and cheese, tteokbokki can be made more delicious and turns this beloved snack into a full meal.","regDate":"2022-08-09","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Experience Programs","Cultural Districts"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-09-1660073871723/2660049_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-08-09-1660073871723"},{"id":"2022-08-09-1660070701249","title":"Seungdong Church (승동교회)","description":"Seungdong Presbyterian Church was designated Tangible Cultural Asset No. 130 by the Seoul Metropolitan Government on April 6, 2001. Originally known as “Gondanggol Church,” the church was established by Samuel Foreman Moore (1860-1906) in 1893. In those days, the church was known as a “baekjeong church” since it primarily drew Korea’s social underdogs such baekjeong (the butchers), the untouchable class of Joseon society. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFollowing a number of relocations and name changes (called “Gondanggol,” “Jungang,” and finally “Seungdong”) the church was moved to its current location in Insadong. After Moore died in 1906, Charles Allen Clark became the pastor of the church and Mongyang Yuh Woon-hyung, a key figure in the political history of Joseon, became active in the church. The church was attended by many other activists as well. In fact, the large student demonstration that took place during the March 1st Independence Movement in 1919 was organized by a group of young church members. The church once again made its mark on history with the establishment of the Joseon Theological Seminary in 1939. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeungdong Church (B1-2F) covers a total of 660 square meters.

Coadjutor bishop Coste was in charge of design and construction and the building was eventually completed in 1892. The church was named after Yakjeonhyeon, or a hill of medicinal herbs.
