The theme park provides children with a chance to experience jobs that they might want to have when they grow up! Job experiences include working as a policeman, flight attendant, firefighter, or chef (uniforms are provided). When you work hard in Kidzania, you get paid in Kidzo (a virtual currency). You can put your money in the bank for your next visit or purchase goods at the department store. In order to make the environment as realistic as possible, every building, car, and tree is reduced to 2/3 its real size, helping children feel more adult-like in their new world! Kidzania mimics a real city environment, has diverse jobs, and is full of events. When there is a fire, a fireman rushes to help, and a news reporter covers the story. While 911 paramedics give first aid to fire victims, in another part of “town” delivery personnel are dropping off packages. Kidzania teaches the next generation how to live as responsible members of society and gives them an introduction to how the economy works.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 \u003cbr\u003e (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) \u003cbr\u003e • For more info: +82-1544-5110|\n|opendate:|February 27, 2010|\n|parking:|Available|\n|restdate:|N/A (Open all year round)\u003cbr\u003e* Subject to closure; refer to the website for details|\n|usetime:|Session 1 10:00-15:00 \u003cbr\u003eSession 2 15:00-19:30\u003cbr\u003eAll-day pass (Session 1 \u0026 2) 10:00-19:30|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Film Locations:|Various variety shows|\n|Available Facilities:|[Experience facilities]\u003cbr\u003eBank, acting school, driving tracks, fire emergency department, flower atelier, extreme climbing, voice recording studio, hospital, robotics laboratory, photo studio, TV studio, police station, radio studio, magic school, and more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e[Convenience facilities]\u003cbr\u003eInformation center, storage lockers, lost and found, nurse office, parents lounge, nursery, etc.\u003cBR\u003e\u003cBR\u003e[Restaurants \u0026  others]\u003cBR\u003eKidzania Cafeteria, multishop, Airshop, National Store, Kid's Corner, Snow Town, Candy Shop, Smoothie King, Lotteria, etc.|\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n|Admission Fees:|Children: Session 1 42,000 won / Session 2 38,000 won / All-day pass 61,000 won\u003cbr\u003eGuardian: Session 1 19,000 won / Session 2 17,000 won / All-day pass 20,000 won \u003cbr\u003e3-Hour Ticket - Children 25,000 won / Guardian 11,000 won\u003cbr\u003e(Session 1 - Admission after 12:00 / Session 2 - Admission after 16:30)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* Children (ages 3-16) / Guardian (ages 17 and older)\u003cbr\u003e* Children below 10 years old must be accompanied by a guardian\u003cbr\u003e* Guardians are not allowed to enter without accompanying a child\u003cbr\u003e* Babies (ages 3 or younger): Free admission (participation in hands-on programs not allowed)|\n|Parking Fees:|Weekdays - First 3 hours free / 3,000 won charged for additional 3 hours\u003cbr\u003eWeekends \u0026 public holidays: First 3 hours free / 11,200 won charged for additional 3 hours\u003cbr /\u003e* Guests using Lotte World parking lot can apply for 3 free hours at the Kidzania information desk.|\n|Reservation Info. for Foreigners:|Tickets can be purchased on-site|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-08-04-1659656133025/2031376_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659656133025/2031376_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659656133025/2031379_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659656133025/2031379_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659656133025/2031381_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659656133025/2031381_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-08-04-1659656133025/2031382_image2_1.webp](/2022-08-04-1659656133025/2031382_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-1544-5110](tel:+8215445110)\n- [🏠www.kidzania.co.kr](http://www.kidzania.co.kr/)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.5110683960\nlongitude: 127.0981394766\ntitle: 240, Olympic-ro, Songpa-gu, Seoul\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway]\u003cbr\u003e\nJamsil Station (Seoul Subway Line 2), Exit 4.\u003cbr\u003e\nGo straight 300m towards Lotte World.\u003cbr\u003e\nTurn left in front of the outdoor parking lot to arrive at the Kidzania.\n","data":{"id":"2022-08-04-1659656133025","title":"Kidzania Seoul (키자니아 서울)","description":"Kidzania, located in Jamsil, Songpa-gu, Seoul, is a unique family entertainment space especially for children ages 3 to 16.

The park is located at what was originally the site of Wongaksa Temple, built during the 13th year of Joseon King Sejo's reign. However, the temple was destroyed and the site did not become a park until 1897 due to a proposal made by Englishman John Mcleavy Brown, an advisor to King Gojong. The park is also important for being the starting point for the March 1 Independence Movement in Seoul. The original name of the park was Pagoda Park, but was changed to the current Tapgol Park on May 28, 1992. The park contains several monuments and heritages, including the Ten-story Stone Pagoda of Wongaksa Temple Site (National Treasure), Stele for the Construction of Daewongaksa Temple at Wongaksa Temple Site (Treasure), and Palgakjeong Pavilion, where the Independence Proclamation was first declared; the independence movement relief plate; and the statue of Son Byeong-hee.","regDate":"2022-08-10","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Seoul","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Parks"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-10-1660114076645/2601459_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Seoul/2022-08-10-1660114076645"},{"id":"2022-08-10-1660109832357","title":"Taereung and Gangneung Royal Tombs [UNESCO World Heritage] (서울 태릉과 강릉 [유네스코 세계문화유산])","description":"Designated as a Historic Site, Taereung \u0026 Gangneung Royal Tombs is comprised of two tombs.
