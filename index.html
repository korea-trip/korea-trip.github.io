They include “Muninseok,” a statue of a civil officer, “Muinseok,” a statue of a military officer, and “Seokma,” a statue of a horse. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Geolleung is the joint tomb of King Jeongjo (1752-1800), the 22nd ruler of the Joseon dynasty, and Queen Hyoui (1753-1821). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e King Jeongjo’s last wish was to be buried near his father’s tomb in Yungneung. King Jeongjo was the second son of King Jangjo and Queen Heongyeong, but in 1759, when he was 8 years old, he was designated as the heir to the throne. During his 24 year-reign, King Jeongjo influenced state affairs by implementing the “Tangpyeongchaek (a policy to balance the power of political factions),” and he also had great accomplishments in the area of academic research by creating the “Gyujanggak (a national royal library).” \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Queen Hyoui was a daughter of Kim Si Muk and was installed as a partner of the heir to the throne at the age of 10. In 1776, when King Jeongjo ascended the throne, she also became Queen. She is known to have led a frugal life. In 1821, she died without an heir at the age of 69 in Jagyeongjeon, Changgyeonggung Palace. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Geolleung looks very similar to Yungneung, but unlike Yungneung, it does not have a “Byeongpungseok,” which is a wide and rectangular stone that surrounds the mound and protects it. Instead, it is surrounded by “Nanganseok,” stone handrails. On every handrail, lotus flowers are engraved. King Jeongjo’s tomb is simpler and less decorated than his father’s, which reflects King Jeongjo’s respect and love for his father. Both Geolleung and Yungneung are designated as Historic Site No. 206.","regDate":"2022-09-21","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Gyeonggi-do","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Gyeonggi-do/2022-09-21-1663736793928"},{"id":"2022-09-20-1663670813897","title":"Yongsopokpo Falls (용소폭포)","description":"Three kilometers up Domachigyegok Valley from Sampalgyo Bridge, Yongsopokpo Falls flows peacefully into Yongso Pond.

As part of the plan, he reformed the military system and strengthened the army and military enforcements. King Hyojong had spent time in northern China when he was taken hostage by the Manchus. During that time he became exposed to many different cultures and technological advancements.

According to the Samguk Sagi (history of the three kingdoms), Byeokgolje was first built in the 21st year of the reign of King Heulhae (AD 330) of the Silla Kingdom. However, this region belonged to the Baekje kingdom at that time, so some counter that the embankment was actually built in the 27th year of King Biryou (AD 330) of the Baekje kingdom. Historians agree, however, that the reservoir was mended by King Wonseong of Silla in AD 790 and by King Hyeonjong and King Injong of the Goryeo Dynasty in AD 1143. In 1415, King Taejong of the Joseon dynasty rebuilt the whole facility, but it was washed away in heavy rains five years later in the 2nd year of King Sejong.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnly about three kilometers of the reservoir embankment remain intact today.
