The street became connected samchi, or grilled seerfish, over 40 years ago with the opening House of Inha, a home-style restaurant. Originally, the street was not known for samchi, but it became one of the most popular menus at the restuarant, with many other shops in the area following in this trend. In 2002, it was designated as the grilled seerfish street and a signboard was put up at the street entrance. Currently, there are about a dozen grilled seerfish restaurants lining the street, and each restaurant has a unique signboard of its own. The fish are imported from New Zealand, and each restaurant offers a distinct taste resulting from different grilling methods and sauces. The restaurants also sell a variety of appetizers and side dishes at affordable prices.\n\n  \n## Intro\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|expagerange:|Open to visitors of all ages|\n|infocenter:|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330\u003cbr\u003e(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) \u003cbr\u003e• For more info: +82-32-832-3031|\n|restdate:|Varies by shop|\n|usetime:|Varies by shop|\n  \n## Detail Info\n\n| | |\n| - | - |\n|Restrooms:|Available|\n  \n## Detail Image\n![/2022-07-12-1657605089652/728363_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-12-1657605089652/728363_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-12-1657605089652/728365_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-12-1657605089652/728365_image2_1.webp)\n![/2022-07-12-1657605089652/728366_image2_1.webp](/2022-07-12-1657605089652/728366_image2_1.webp)\n\n\n  \n## Contact\n\n- [☎️+82-32-832-3031](tel:+82328323031)\n- [🏠itour.incheon.go.kr\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.icjg.go.kr/tour/cttu0207a01\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.icjg.go.kr](http://itour.incheon.go.kr)\n\n\n```googleMap\nlatitude: 37.4757224674\nlongitude: 126.6286721359\ntitle: 57, Uhyeon-ro 67beon-gil, Jung-gu, Incheon\n```\n  \n## Directions\n  \n[Subway]\u003cbr\u003e\nDongincheon Station (Seoul \nSubway Line 1), Exit 2. \u003cbr\u003e\nTurn right, then immediately  turn left, and then go straight for about 150 m. \u003cbr\u003e\nTurn right at the corner onto Uhyeonno 67beon-gil. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n[Bus] \u003cbr\u003e\nDongincheon Station Bus Stop\u003cBr\u003e\n- Local Bus: 2, 3, 4, 6, 6-1, 10, 11, 15, 16, 17-1, 21, 21-1, 22, 23, 24, 27, 28, 41, 42, 45, 46, or 62 \u003cbr\u003e  \n- Express bus: 105, 112, or 306\n","data":{"id":"2022-07-12-1657605089652","title":"Dongincheon Samchi Street (동인천 삼치거리)","description":"Dongincheon Samchi Street is located in front of Dongincheon Station in an alley to the side of Incheon Educational and Cultural Center for Students.

During Sinmiyangyo (the American invasion in 1871), Gwangseongbo was the fiercest battle ground in Ganghwa. On April 24, 1871, a  fleet with 1,230 American naval forces led by Rear Admiral John Rodgers landed on Ganghwado Island to demand the opening of Korea's ports and commerce. The armed forces attacked Chojijin Fortress and Deokjinjin Camp, then marched to Gwangseongbo Fortress, where they engaged in close combat with the warriors of Joseon. Although General Eo Jae-yeon and the other warriors were poorly equipped with far inferior weapons, they bravely fought to the death against the invading forces. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe battlefield ruins of the fortress and the gate towers such as Anhaeru, Gwangseongdon, Sondolmokdon, and Yongdudon were repaired in 1977.  The twin tombs of General Eo Jae-Yeon and his brother Eo Jae-seon, along with the anonymous tombs of warriors who died on the battlefield were also honorably arranged at the same time. Furthermore, a stone monument commemorating the restoration of Ganghwa Battlefield was erected on Yongdudondae Post. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 1988, an extensive rest area was created toward the shore for visitors’ convenience.

In the 19th year of his reign, King Gojong moved the capital to Ganghwa on account of its natural and strategic advantages. During the Byeongjahoran (Chinese invasion of Korea) in 1637, the palace was lost by force to the Qing dynasty of China. Later, Joseon Dynasty palace building and Ganghwa Yusubu (Ganghwa governor’s office) buildings existed in the Goryeo palace site but were destroyed by the French army during the Byeonginyangyo (French Campaign against Korea). Nowadays, the only structures that remain are the Dongheon main office (built in 1638) and Ibangcheong administration office (built in 1654). The palace and its subsidiary buildings were restored in 1977. It has historical lessons of the spirit of independence and overcoming national crisis.","regDate":"2022-08-11","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Culture/Art/History","Historical Sites","Historic Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-11-1660185152853/1575652_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-08-11-1660185152853"},{"id":"2022-08-10-1660174693655","title":"Geojampo Beach (거잠포해변)","description":"Although Geojampo beach is on the west coast, the estuary is facing the east allowing for a great view of the sunset and sunrise. The nearby Maedo Island is also called Sharkseom Island because it creates the shape of a shark's fin. The sunlight along the ocean creates a beautiful view during sunrise and sunset. The beach is lined with pine trees and has white sand, making it a popular family vacation destination. There are plans to develop the area to an international vacation destination.","regDate":"2022-08-10","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Incheon","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2022-08-10-1660174693655/2661929_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Incheon/2022-08-10-1660174693655"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/[...pid]","query":{"pid":["Incheon","2022-07-12-1657605089652"]},"buildId":"NOndQAz3YgmkXRI5HCOr0","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
