The cave is approximately 200 meters in length, 10 meters in x_width and 5 meters in x_height. It is thought to have been created by the lava that erupted from Hallasan Mountain some 25 million years ago. This cave uniquely contains features of both lava and limestone caves. The entire area surrounding the cave is a huge stratum of seashells and sand, while the interior of the cave has a mystical ambience due to its various formations such as stalactites and stalagmites, hanging from the ceiling and sprouting up from the bottom of the cave. The cave also features pillars formed when stalactites and stalagmites join together. The cave walls are covered in lime, which at times looks like beautiful cave paintings. The temperature inside the cave stays at 17~18℃ throughout the year, making the cave a welcome escape from the summer heat and a great place to keep warm during winter. \u003cBr\u003e\u003cBr\u003eHyeopjaegul Lava Tube has been designated Natural Monument No. 236 and ranks among the world’s major mysterious caves, such as the stone salt cave of Peru and the underwater limestone caves of Yugoslavia.

Despite its small size, the pond is said to have been the location of the wedding between the Samsinin (three founding demi-gods) and three princesses of the East Kingdom. Next to the pond is Samseonghyeol, three caves that served as bridal homes. Honinji Pond and Samseonghyeol are great places to trace the origin of the founders of Jeju Island.

The beach used to be open for swimming but a variety of issues caused the beach to close for safety. The beach is located along Jeju Olle Trail Course 10, and features a campground nearby. The campground is a paid service and requires advance reservation during peak season. In summer, visitors can enjoy sea walking here, a water leisure sport featuring a divers helmet. Across from the beach is a field of sunflowers standing before Sanbangsan Mountain.","regDate":"2023-02-16","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-16-1676525759109"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/[...pid]","query":{"pid":["Jeju-do","2023-02-12-1676183906205"]},"buildId":"dHB0aOnVfGi4ZoB182136","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
