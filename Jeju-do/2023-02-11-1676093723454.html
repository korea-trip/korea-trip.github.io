Munseom, where the submarine travels, is home to outstanding coral reefs, colorful schools of fish, and rich seaweed. The exquisite landscape makes it one of the most beautiful places to dive as well. Going deep into the 40 meter sea-bed, visitors can see countless fish, rare iridescent coral reefs, and a surreal-looking shipwreck with schools of fish surrounding it.

The park is located approximately 700 meters above sea level, and is 10 °C lower in average temperature compared to that of Seogwipo’s downtown, providing the ideal condition to enjoy forest bathing and camping from spring to fall. The park is easily accessible by car, thanks to the paved road from the mountain’s foothills all the way up to the park’s entrance. It takes about 30 minutes by car from Seogwipo’s downtown to the recreational park. The park is densely packed with trees and the air is filled with the refreshing forest scent, and even has a pebble walking trail suitable for a barefoot massage.
