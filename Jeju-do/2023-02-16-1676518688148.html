This colorful sandy beach is 560 meters in length and 50 meters in x_width and has appeared in several dramas and movies thanks to its beautiful scenery created by Jeju Island\u0026rsquo;s black basalt and jinmosal. The cliffs that line the shore on the right lead to a naturally formed 15-meter-long cave. The cliffs are also a habitat for many rare species, serving as a perfect spot for an ecology tour. Jungmun Beach offers a variety of marine sports such as parasailing, water skiing, windsurfing, scuba diving, rafting, and yacht tours for an exciting vacation under the sun.","regDate":"2023-02-17","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Nature","Natural Sites"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-17-1676616039038/1617133_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-17-1676616039038"},{"id":"2023-02-17-1676612149553","title":"Jeju Sanbangsan Carbonate Hot Springs (제주 산방산탄산온천)","description":"Jeju Sanbangsan Carbonate Hot Springs is a rare carbon hot spring, and the first public hot spring in Jeju. In May 2004, it was designated a site for protection as a hot springs source (Jeju Notice No. 2004-12). The hot springs opened in 2005 with Gumyeongsu, a hot springs public bath, spanning 11,111 square meters, housed in a 3,300-square-meter building with an estimated 1,000-person capacity. Sanggoji is the on-site restaurant, and means rainbow in the local dialect. Carbon hot springs are known to have health benefits for the heart, as carbonic acid gas is absorbed in the skin, stimulating capillary vessels and expanding blood vessels. This enhances blood circulation, lowering blood pressure and reducing the burden on the heart.","regDate":"2023-02-17","author":"korea-tour","tag":["Jeju-do","Culture/Art/History","Recreational Sites","Hot Springs \u0026 Spa"],"imgUrl":"/2023-02-17-1676612149553/1620176_image2_1.webp","blogPath":"Jeju-do/2023-02-17-1676612149553"}],"navList":["Busan","Chungcheongbuk-do","Chungcheongnam-do","Daegu","Daejeon","Gangwon-do","Gwangju","Gyeonggi-do","Gyeongsangbuk-do","Gyeongsangnam-do","Incheon","Jeju-do","Jeollabuk-do","Jeollanam-do","Sejong","Seoul","Ulsan"]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/[...pid]","query":{"pid":["Jeju-do","2023-02-16-1676518688148"]},"buildId":"8cdssj_v9f7Xqz4YxBUgp","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
